     1.  EXT. NIGHT. - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT
     
     WINDS HOWL. Rain drives horizontal. The sea surges up, 
     nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty 
     Hawk. The carrier plunges, driving its bow into a wall of 
     grey water. The deck pitches forward and back, rolls left to 
     right, and yaws in a corkscrew motion. The entire 93,000 ton 
     behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL. 
     
     
     2.  SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT
     
     A ROAR. Silver wings flash by, a cockpit, fiery jet 
     exhausts. A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area 
     the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH. 
     
     2A.  A SHOWER OF SPARKS, A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as 
     the gear hits the deck. The hook catches the 3 wire and the 
     F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt. It's the scariest thing 
     you've ever seen, the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and 
     just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator.
     
     TITLES OVER 
     
     HARD DRIVING ROCK AND ROLL - THE CARS - RIDE ME HIGH
     
     
     3.  FLIGHT DECK - THE LANDING SIGNAL OFFICER - (LSO)
     
     Leans almost horizontal into the winds. He holds the pickle, 
     controlling the landing lights and speaks into a mike. His 
     calm, professional commands belie the extreme conditions.
     
               LSO
     POWER, POWER...DON'T CLIMB...
     OKAY, HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
     
     
     4.  ANOTHER TOMCAT FLIES OVER THE RAMP
     
     It slams in. The pilot hits full power, catches the wire, slams 
     to a stop, cuts his engines.
     
     5.  OMITTED
     
     6.  AIR OPS - BELOW DECK 
     
     Lots of scopes and electronic gear. The CARRIER CONTROL APPROACH 
     OFFICER (CCA) watches a blip on radar, reaches for his mike key.
     
     
     
     7.  EXT. THE TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)
     
     We float like gods, above the storm, above the cloud cover, 
     looking down. From overhead, a probe slides into frame, then 
     a graceful nose. The cockpit sides by, Pilot, then Radar 
     Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow 
     of their instruments. The fuselage gracefully swells to two 
     enormous air intakes, then variable angle wings, swept back 
     for high speed flight. Twin tailbooms cant outward, 
     horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments. Enormous 
     twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight.
     
     
     8.  INT. COCKPIT - (AERIAL)
     
     We become aware of WIND WHISTLE, JET ENGINE SOUNDS, RADIO 
     STATIC. The pilot, COUGAR, is calm, steady. The Radar 
     Intercept Officer in the backseat, GOOSE, is a wildman, 
     always an edge of humor in his voice. A UHF transmission 
     breaks in..
     
               STRIKE (V.O. filtered)
     GHOST RIDER, THIS IS STRIKE... WE 
     HAVE UNKNOWN CONTACT INBOUND, 
     MUSTANG. YOUR VECTOR ZERO NINE ZERO 
     FOR BOGEY.
     
     Almost immediately the RIO picks up a target and responds.
     
               GOOSE
     CONTACT 20 LEFT AT 25, 900 KNOTS 
     CLOSURE.
     
     
     8A.  ANGLE - SECOND F-14 - 115 - COUGAR'S WINGMAN 
     
     Come in on the cockpit with stenciled name and call signs: LT. 
     EVAN MITCHELL is the pilot, MAVERICK. In flight suit and oxygen 
     mask, we can only see his eyes. they are confident. In his 
     mid-twenties, he is lean, hard, athletic...the archetype fighter 
     pilot. His rear-seater is LTJG. WALTER MERLIN; WIZARD.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'LL I.D. HIM, YOU HOOK 'EM.
     
     Maverick peels off to right, to high cover position; 5 o'clock.
     
     
     9.  INT. GHOST RIDER 117 - COUGAR'S POV
     
     HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) glows dimly on the windscreen. Directly 
     in front of the stick, two CRT screens display data. The bottom 
     screen shows a radar sweep. Wedged between the instruments is a 
     snapshot of a pretty young woman with a 2 month-old baby.
     
     
               GOOSE
     Closing fast. MUSTANG, THIS IS 
     GHOST RIDER ONE ONE SEVEN. CONTACT 
     ONE BOGEY, 090 AT 15 MILES, 900 
     KNOTS OF CLOSURE.
               COUGAR
     Look for the trailer.
     
               GOOSE
     I don't see anything.  MAVERICK, 
     YOU HAVE A TRAILER?
     
     
     10.  MAVERICK'S F-14 
     
     Flying in combat spread, 1 mile abeam, higher. 
     
               GOOSE
     NEGATIVE, COUGAR. LOOKS LIKE HE'S 
     SINGLE.
     
     
     11.  INT. 117 - COUGAR'S COCKPIT
     
               COUGAR
     HANG BACK AND WATCH FOR HIM. HERE 
     COMES...MIG ONE.
     
     
     12.  EXT. SKY 
     
     Closing at 900 knots, The MiG is a speck, then a flash and a 
     ROAR, a knife-edge pass at 300 feet. It rockets past his left 
     wing tip and disappears. Cougar kicks rudder, whips the stick, 
     screams into a tight turning roll and dives after him. He slams 
     the throttle forward to ZONE 5 AFTERBURNER.  
     
     
     13.  EXT. - MAVERICK'S F-14
     
     Maverick sees a SECOND MiG drop from above onto Cougar's tail.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     BOGEY ON YOUR SIX. I'M ON HIS.
     
     Maverick swings after him, lights it. 
     
     
     13A.  ALL FOUR JETS SCREAM DOWN IN A POWER DIVE. 
     
     They punch through cloud cover into the soup.
     
     
     
     14.  EXT. COUGAR'S F-14 
     
     He is closing on the first MiG when a shocking BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP 
     tone breaks into their headsets.
     
               GOOSE
     I've got a six strobe.  I think 
     he's locked on us.
     
               COUGAR
     It's a MiG 21. They don't have 
     radar missiles!
     
               GOOSE
     Let's hope you're right!
     
               COUGAR
     What is he doing?
     
               GOOSE
     He's pissing me off!
     
     Cougar swings mad gyrations, cutting back and forth across the 
     front MiG's tailpipe, trying to break the lock-on. The TONE grows 
     more insistant.
     
               COUGAR
     Can't shake him.
     
               MAVERICK (V.O.) 
     WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
     
               COUGAR
     Maintaining course. Straight for 
     Mustang.
     
               GOOSE
     Stay with him.
     
     The tone grows steady, BLIPBLIPBLIPBLIP.
     
               GOOSE
        (alarmed)
     That's missile lock! 
     
               COUGAR
     He better be kidding!
     
               GOOSE
     Lordy!  Eyeball to Asshole.
     Hope nobody burps!
     
     
     
     14A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
     
               MAVERICK
     I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. (to himself)  
     Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
     
               COUGAR
     I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
     
               MAVERICK
     ROGER, COUGAR. (to himself and his RIO) 
     Okay boys, pull out with your hands up 
     and nobody'll get hurt.
     
     
     14B.  INT. COUGAR'S F-14
     
     Up front, Cougar checks his gunsight...He gets I.R. lock...
     
               COUGAR
     We're locked on MiG ONE. Why 
     doesn't he disengage?
     
               GOOSE
     These guys are getting on my 
     nerves.
     
     
     14C.   FINALLY, MIG ONE TURNS AWAY.
     
               GOOSE
     GHOST RIDER TO MUSTANG. BANDITS  
     TURNING AWAY.
     
     But Cougar presses forward, and MiG TWO stays on his tail.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     COUGAR, BREAK LEFT. TRY A HIGH G 
     ROLL UNDERNEATH. BREAK OUT THE 
     BOTTOM.
     
     Anger gives way to discipline. Cougar's Tomcat breaks left, 
     dives into dense cloud. MiG TWO still follows.
     
               MAVERICK
     HE'S STILL ON YOU, COUGAR.
     
     
     15.  EXT. COUGAR - IN THE CLOUDS
     
     Still hears the tone, BLIPBLIPBLIP...
     
               COUGAR
     
     I KNOW. I KNOW.
     
     He rolls over into wild evasive maneuvers, finally breaks lock. 
     
     
     16.  INT. MIG
     
     Breaks out of cloud, looks around, startled.  There is nothing, 
     no F-14. He scans the sky frantically, while rolling the 
     aircraft. ...Suddenly, he feels a presence. He looks straight up 
     and behind him. A few feet away, a TOMCAT slides into position 
     canopy to canopy, an incredible feat of flying. Maverick and 
     Wizard stare at him. Maverick slides even closer, canopies nearly 
     touching. The MiG pilot acknowledges them with a weak wave.  
     Maverick stares for a moment, then flips him the bird. 
     
     The MiG pushes negative G, hard down and away. He heads for the 
     deck.
     
               WIZARD
     He's running for it.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Ah, the thrill of victory and the 
     agony of defeat.
     
               WIZARD
     Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 
     4.0.  We're gonna get them wet 
     unless we find a Sonoco station.
     
               MAVERICK
     COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK.  I'M 
     GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE 
     BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
     
     
     17.  EXT. KITTY HAWK FLIGHT DECK - THE LSO 
     
     Stands the on plunging deck, peering into the roaring night.

               COUGAR
     
     This is crazy. How the hell we 
     supposed to land on something we 
     can't even see!
     
               GOOSE
     Hey, if it was easy, everybody 
     would want to come up here and do 
     it..... Instead of just us.

     Call the ball?  I don't see the 
     ship!
     
     
     20.  INT. COCKPIT 117 - COUGAR'S POV
     
     
     BLASTS slam the airframe. Rain tattoos the canopy. A gust rolls 
     the Tomcat, he straightens it, A gust flips it again.
     
     
     20A.  MAVERICK'S POV 
     
     The Carrier lights appear and disappear through the storm.
     
     
     21.  INT. COCKPIT 117 - COUGAR
     
                 GOOSE
        (To Himself)
     
     A walk in the park, Mustang. You 
     with me, cat man?...Cougar...you 
     with me?
     
     Goose is thrown about as the wing dips, straightens, dips.
     
               COUGAR
     Help me with this one, I'm really 
     screwed up.
     
               GOOSE
     Bring it left. Bring it left, 
     You're high.
     
               COUGAR
     This is crazy!
     
               GOOSE
     What is?
     
               COUGAR
     Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
     
               GOOSE
     What?  What is it?
     
               COUGAR
     Were upside down!
     
               GOOSE
     You're crazy. We're level.
     
               COUGAR
     Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in 
     my straps!
     
               GOOSE
     You're not. We're level. Look at 
     the instruments, we're okay!
     
               COUGAR
     They must be broken. I'm hanging in 
     my straps! We're inverted!
     
               GOOSE
     We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
     
     
     22.  FLIGHT DECK - LSO CONTROLLING 115 - MAVERICK
     
               LSO
     A LITTLE POWER...FLY THE BALL.    
     LOOKING GOOD...HOLD WHAT YOU GOT.
     
     
     
     23.  MAVERICK'S F-14 - ON FINAL APPROACH.
     
     
     24.  INT. COCKPIT - MAVERICK
     
     He hears Cougar's chatter over the air.
     
               COUGAR (V.O. filtered)
     WE'RE UPSIDE DOWN! WE CAN'T LAND!
     
               GOOSE (V.O. filtered)
     WELL, WE CAN'T STAY UP HERE EITHER.
     
     
     25.  FLIGHT DECK 
     
     Maverick's plane settles in over the ramp, suddenly, BLASTS FROM 
     IT'S AFTERBURNERS...it ROARS over the deck without touching and 
     off into the night. The LSO is shocked into comment.
     
     
               LSO
     WHERE THE HELL YOU GOING?
     
     
     26.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT  - (AERIAL)
     
               MAVERICK

               WIZARD
     What the hell you doing?
     
               MAVERICK
     Helping him in.
     
               WIZARD
     What makes you think we can get 
     back in?  We don't have the fuel 
     for this.
               MAVERICK
     Just get me to him.
     
               WIZARD
     He's nine o'clock high. We're two 
     thousand pounds low!
     
     
     27.  DARK TURBULENT CLOUDS
     
     Maverick's plane pulls up behind Cougar's. Cougar's plane 
     suddenly flips over, flying inverted.
     
     
               COUGAR
     I'm pulling up.
     
               GOOSE
     No! Now we're inverted!
     
     
     Maverick pulls up off the wing of the inverted aircraft. His 
     voice is calmness itself.
     
               MAVERICK
     HEY, ANY OF YOU GUYS SEEN AN
     AIRCRAFT CARRIER AROUND HERE?
     
     Cougar looks over, surprised.
     
               COUGAR
     WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
     
               MAVERICK
     EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.
     ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU.
     YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
     
     Nothing happens.
     
               MAVERICK
     COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. HALF ROLL 
     IT. NOW!
     
     
     Cougar's plane completes the roll, is now upright.
     
               GOOSE
     We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to 
     put it down.
     
               COUGAR
     It's crazy, man. Instruments are 
     crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
     
               GOOSE
     TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR 
     INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
     
               MAVERICK
     YOU'RE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL, COUGAR.
               COUGAR
     I'M HANGING IN MY STRAPS. I TURN IT 
     OVER AND I'M STILL HANGING IN MY 
     STRAPS. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON 
     UP HERE?
     
               MAVERICK
     YOU'RE NOT IN THE STRAPS.  IT'S 
     VERTIGO, THAT'S ALL IT IS. STAY ON 
     MY WING. I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
     
     Maverick pulls up wing tip to wing tip, inches apart.
     
               COUGAR
     MAVERICK.
     
               MAVERICK
     YEAH, COUGAR?
     
     
               COUGAR
     YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME...
     IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
     
               MAVERICK
     NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL.
          EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
     
               COUGAR
     I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M 
     GONNA EJECT.
     
               GOOSE
     Look at the weather! They'll never 
     find us! We're near out of fuel.

     COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
     
               COUGAR
     OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS 
     THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL 
     HAVE YOUR BUTT!
     
               GOOSE
     You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be 
     where your head used to be.
     
     
     28.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK 
     
     All eyes are on what they can see of the approach of the two 
     planes. Maverick drops him off at the pattern and circles. The 
     LSO watches the approach. The Tomcat drops a wing, straightens, 
     drops the wing, straightens ... the approach of a pilot 
     experiencing vertigo as Cougar tries to satisfy his inner ear.
     
               LSO
     LEVEL...YOUR WINGS... EASY... 
     YOU'RE SETTLING....FLY THE BALL.
     
     A wind shear just off the ramp drives the plane suddenly down.
     
               LSO
     POWER...POWER!..POWER!...WAVE OFF!  
     WAVE OFF  WAVE OFF!
     
     
     AFTERBURNERS BLAST, but the Tomcat horrifyingly settles tail-low 
     toward the deck. The deck crew watches in terror as the plane 
     wallows in toward them. The LSO'S turn, take a few steps and 
     throw themselves off the flight deck.
     
     They sail into the night toward the surging seas a hundred feet 
     below, then are caught in safety nets hung off the side.
     
     
     28A.  THE PLANE
     
     Settles, settles, standing on it's engines, trying to arrest 
     it's downward momentum. The hook raises sparks as it skids across 
     the deck... The plane stops falling and hangs for a moment, about 
     to blast back up, when the hook catches the last wire.. The wire 
     snags it, plucking 45,000 pounds of fuel, metal and men out of 
     the air and slamming it all to the deck. WHAMMMM! Right wheel 
     flies up the deck and over the side...the gear collapses. The 
     plane SCREECHES sideways. The crew watches helplessly as it skids 
     slams into it and comes to rest in cloud of fuel vapor and steam.
     
     The LSO runs up, shouting into the mike. 
     
               LSO
     COUGAR, GOOSE...COME IN COUGAR!

     Crash crew leaps into action. The fire crew is there. The man in 
     the Silver Suit jumps up on the wing and crawls to the cockpit. 
     The figures inside are not moving. He hits the canopy release. 
     The canopy pops open. Silver suit grabs at the rear seat harness 
     release. He screams through his suit's aluminized cloth...
     
               SILVER SUIT
     Goose, can you hear me?  Goose!
     
     Nothing for a moment. He's dead! Then the RIO'S helmet 
     moves...His head turns. He tears the mask away from his face, 
     looks up at Silver Suit. His head clears.
     
               GOOSE
     Oh, Hello... Valet parking?
     
     Silver suit is stunned for a moment. He straightens up, his head 
     inclines quizzically. Then it hits him.
     
               SILVER SUIT
     Son of a bitch!
     
               GOOSE
     You will put it up front,
     with the Porsches?
     
     He grabs him under the armpits, drags him out of the plane. 
     
               GOOSE
     Hey...easy...Take it easy...
     I'm a veteran!
     
     
     Goose grabs a passing crewman by the arm.
     
               GOOSE
     Can you check under the hood. I 
     thought I heard a funny noise.
     
     Other crewmembers help Cougar out. He seems stunned, but Goose 
     reacts to his fear with frantic one-liners. He grabs a crew 
     member's radio, as Silver Suit helps him away and looks to the 
     figures of the Admiral and the Air Boss far up on the bridge... 
     He waves to them, does his best impression...Desi Arnaz.

     28B.  BRIDGE FLIGHT DECK
     
     A moment of disbelief... Then hysterical, tension relieving 
     laughter.
     
     
     28C.  FLIGHT DECK
     
     Goose spots Cougar being helped out. He pulls away, reaches back 
     into the cockpit and grabs Cougar's snapshot of wife and kid. 
     They lead Goose away as firemen blast the aircraft with foam.

     29.  FLIGHT DECK
     
     A TILLIE, a four wheel mobile crane, slams up to the plane and 
     slings its lifting harness. Goose turns to Silver Suit.
     
               GOOSE
     Well...there goes your tip.

     The TOMCAT slams onto the deck, clearing the wreckage by inches.
     
     
     31.  INT. CARRIER HATCHWAY - FLIGHT SURGEON, OTHERS 
     
     Watch as they bring a shaken Cougar past. Goose, eyes wild, 
     waves at Maverick and Wizard, rolling up. They flame out - 
     VVOOOMMMMM! They sit there, immobile, waiting for a tow, looking 
     numb.  Goose does his "stewardess".
     
               GOOSE
     On behalf of your Captain and your 
     crew, I want to thank you for 
     flying VF101. And next time your

     frigging night, I hope you'll think 
     of Naval Aviation.
     
     The surgeon looks into Goose's eyes.

     Stress reaction...

     32.  SICK BAY - LATER
     
     Cougar lies alone in the dimness, staring at the overhead.
     
     33. 03 LEVEL - BELOW DECKS - OFFICER'S COUNTRY
     
     The usual CLANGS, WHISTLES, ENGINES of Navy life sound FORLORN 
     ECHOING through the dim, deserted passage. From the distance, a 
     single figure passes in and out of the glow of the overhead 
     lights. Cougar comes closer, hobbling unsteadily.
     
     He reaches a door, pulls himself erect and knocks on the sign:
     
     Commander Tom Otawoczek
     CO VF 101
     STINGER
     
     
     34.  STINGER'S CABIN
     
     The skipper works at his desk, responds without looking up.
     
               STINGER
     Come in.
     
     He looks up. Cougar stands in the doorway, a strange, dazed look 
     on his face.
     
               STINGER
     Cougar, what is it? You should be 
     in sick bay. What are you doing?
     
     He walks over to the skipper's desk. His eyes are glazed, but 
     his jaw is firm.
     
               COUGAR
     Thinking of my wife and kid.
     
     A determined movement. Hand to chest.
     
     
     34A. OMITTED
     
     Something metal hits it, skids across the polished surface and 
     clangs up against the coffee mug: gold wings.
     
     
     
     35.  PASSAGEWAY
     
     Cougar comes out of Stinger's room, bumps into Goose, and 
     Maverick. He turns the other way.
     
               GOOSE
     Cougar!
     
     He stops, turns to them. There is nothing to say. Goose hands 
     him his snapshot. Cougar looks at his wife and kid for a moment, 
     then looks up at them. He turns away.
     
               MAVERICK
     Cougar?          STINGER (O.S.)
     Maverick, Goose...Come in here.
     
     
     36.  STINGER'S OFFICE - DOORWAY
     
     Maverick appears, followed by Goose. They stand at 
     attention.
     
               MAVERICK
     Sir?
     
     The Skipper says nothing. Maverick sees the wings on the 
     desk. He enters, walks over, stares down at them. He picks 
     them up. 
     
               GOOSE
     Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
     
               STINGER
     Don't.
     
               MAVERICK
     He's a good pilot.
     
               STINGER
     I talked a man back once. Three 
     months later, we lost him. It's his 
     decision. Only he knows.
     
               GOOSE
     He's the best you have. He's going 
     Top Gun!
     
               STINGER
     Was.
     
               MAVERICK
     What?
     
     
               STINGER
     Was going. (Turns to Maverick.) Now 
     you are.
     
               MAVERICK
     Me?
     
     Maverick stares at the wings, lost in conflicting emotions.
     
               STINGER
     Well, he's going (indicating Goose) 
     and he needs someone to fly the 
     plane.
     
               GOOSE
     Skipper, you can't do this!
     
               STINGER
     I didn't do it, he did it himself. 
     Something about a wife and kid. The 
     fact is, he's lost it. He knows it. 
     I know it. You were up there, you 
     know it, too.
               GOOSE
     Give him a break, Skipper. It was 
     raining snakes up there. He'll be 
     alright, soon as all the gorillas go 
     home...
     
     The Skipper stares at Goose, non-plussed for a moment.
     
               STINGER
     I know some RIOS are a little 
     wiggy...but you abuse the 
     priviledge! I don't believe I'm 
     going to have to put the two of you 
     in the same cockpit...but there it 
     is! It may be good for the Navy. It 
     might be good for you, but most of 
     all, it's good for me. It'll get 
     you out of my sight.
     
     
               GOOSE
     But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked 
     for Top Gun...He's the best of the 
     best!
     
               STINGER
     Well, you'll just have to make do 
     with him (indicates Maverick).
     
     Goose and Maverick exchange looks.
     
     
               GOOSE
     Mav's a great flyer but....
     
               STINGER
     He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, 
     he's so damn good he might have 
     been picked for Top Gun himself. 
     Except for one thing. (SCREAMS) He 
     just can't seem to follow orders!
     
     
     Stinger moves slightly, to stand now, directly in front of 
     Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches.
     
               STINGER
     You just did an incredibly brave thing! 
     What you should have done was land your 
     plane. You don't own that plane, the 
     taxpayers do. I should ream you out for 
     it. But it just doesn't work with you. 
     You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe 
     ...too good. You never really stepped in 
     it yet. So this is your chance. I'm 
     gonna send you up against the best. They 
     are better than you. Maybe they'll knock 
     that shine off your eagle and you'll 
     see, finally, where discipline and 
     teamwork fit it. 
     Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out 
     of it.
     
               MAVERICK
     Sir?
     
               STINGER
     That is all. Tell me about the MiG 
     some other time...
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir!
     
     He snaps off a salute and does an about face.
     
               STINGER
     Maverick..
     
     He turns back.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir..
     
               STINGER
     The wings..
     
     
     He looks down at the wings in his hands, slowing walks over 
     places them gently on the Skipper's desk.
     
               STINGER
     Gentlemen!
     
               MAVERICK/GOOSE
     Sir?
     
     
     His facade cracks just slightly.
     
               STINGER
     Good luck.
     
     
     37.  INT. PASSAGEWAY
     
     Maverick and Goose push through a gauntlet of aircrews. They 
     have become notorious. Guys grab at them...questions...the 
     MiGs?..What happened up there? How close did they get? What did 
     the MiGs do? One word is heard over and over..."TopGun". Goose is 
     left behind in the crowd. Maverick pushes through. He walks 
     fast...faster. Up ladders, around turns, down ladders, through 
     passageways. Faster. He breaks into a trot, then a canter, 
     squeezing past enlisted men, parts lockers, then he breaks into a 
     run...
     
     38.  EXT - CARRIER - NIGHT AND STORM
     
     A hatch slams open on the side of the Carrier. He's out on a 
     catwalk, instantly soaked, running on rain slicked stairs 
     cantilevered high over the breaking seas. He plunges forward to 
     the bow of the ship, stands on the very peak. He is yelling 
     something. He stands there as the bow plunges terrifyingly into 
     the trough. The water rises like a green mountain, up, up to 
     break just a few feet below him, showering him with spray. The 
     noise is incredible. 
     
     Come around on his face. It is maddened. He raises his fist and 
     punches the night.
     
     
     The foaming slope of the wave rushes up, changing color as it 
     DISSOLVES TO:
     
     Desert Sand whipping by...
     
     39.  MOJAVE DESERT - 1 WEEK LATER
     
     A big bike, a real big bike, a turbo...rockets across the 
     desert. Fast. Real fast. Aviator shades low above the handlebars 
     --Maverick. Goose hangs on in back. It cranks faster, pulls 
     closer...ENGINE SCREAMING. It cranks up a notch, it's going to 
     
     explode. It can't go faster, but it does. It SCREAMS HIGHER. It 
     ROARS under, by and away, leaving dust...
     
     
     39A.  THE BIKE - STILL
     
     Silence. Just the HISS AND POP OF METAL COOLING. Maverick sits 
     on it, staring out past us. Goose looks over Maverick's shoulder.
     
     We see why. Feet come into the frame. Then the uniform: 
     California Highway Patrol.
     
     
     40.  COUNTRY ROAD - NEAR SAN DIEGO
     
     40A.  ANGLE ON MAVERICK. CHP enters the frame, the usual 
     hypercivil arrogance tinged with awed disbelief. The usual 
     questions are spaced for effect as if he might be talking to some 
     other form of life. Maverick is off the bike, standing at 
     attention. Goose follows more slowly.
     
               CHP
     Son. Do you know why
     I stopped you?
     
     Maverick has some good idea how to deal with authority.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir. I do sir
     
     The CHP adjusts his own aviator shades.
               CHP
     Well... What   is   it?
     
               MAVERICK
        (more than sincere)
     Sir. You are going to give me a 
     warning, Sir!
     
     
     CHP - A touch of a smile, quickly surpressed.
     
               CHP
     License and registration.
     
     Maverick hands them over with his Navy ID. CHP scans them, 
     hesitates a moment over the last, looks up with a touch more 
     respect.
     
               CHP
     Lieutenant, do you know how fast  
     you were going?
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir. I do, Sir.
     
               CHP
     Well? 
     
               MAVERICK
     Sir. I was going Mach point one 
     five.
     
     CHP nods sagely.
     
               CHP
     One SIXTH the speed of sound!
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir.
     
               CHP
        (a guess)
     Lieutenant... What do you...  
     usually fly?
     
               MAVERICK
     F-14's sir.
     
               CHP
        (new respect)
     Tomcats?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir!
     
     A long pause. Respect in the cop's eyes. He taps the Navy ID on 
     the handlebars...staring at this sincere young man.
     
               CHP
     Lieutenant... Is there...
     a Russian attack?
     
               MAVERICK
     No sir! But you have to be ready. 
     
     
     The cop nods and stares at him.
     
     
     41.  EXT. MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION - LATER
     
     
     41A.  OMIT
     
     
     The bike is BLURPING... barely going fast enough to stay 
     upright. Maverick cool in shades and campaign cap dorks past the 
     hanger with the sign: FIGHTERTOWN, USA. He pulls ahead. In back 
     of him, escorting with flashers...the CHP. They pull up at the 
     gate. Maverick and Goose salute the guard, hands over their ID. 
     The CHP gets out of his car, leans against the door.
     
               CHP
     Lieutenant.
     
     Maverick turns to him.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes, Sergeant?
     
               CHP
     Remember one thing.
     
               MAVERICK
     Sir?
     
               CHP
     Outside of this gate...
     I...am Top Gun.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir!
     
     He salutes. The CHP returns a snappy one. He gets back in his 
     car and turns away. Maverick receives his ID and clearance. As he 
     passes through, a couple of pilots in flight suits (ICE AND 
     HOLLYWOOD) stare at him. The taller, dark, cool one speaks in a 
     dry voice, meant to be overheard.
     
               ICE
     Uh oh, police escort. This one must 
     be a real killer.
     
     The second pilot grins big at them. Maverick turns slightly 
     stares over his shades at them as he passes. Goose grins back the 
     challenge.
     
     42.  AERIAL COMBAT - VIETNAM ERA - F4'S, MIG 17'S - STOCK 
     
     The Doors on the soundtrack.  Jets swoop, missiles fire, a plane 
     explodes. Gun camera views of MiGs, SAMS, flak, bombing runs...
     
               VIPER (V.O.) 
     During the Korean War, the Navy kill 
     ratio was twelve-to-one. We shot down 
     twelve of their jets for every one of 
     ours. In Vietnam, this ratio fell to 
     three-to-one. Our pilots depended on 
     missles. They lost their dogfighting 
     skills.
     
     
     
     F-14's fighting with F-5's. Music becomes current. 
     
               VIPER (V.O.) 
     Top Gun was created to teach ACM. Air 
     Combat Maneuvering...Dogfighting. 
     Richthofen, Guynemer, Rickenbacker, 
     Galland, Rudel, Bong would envy us. We 
     do just what they did, but we do it 
     beyond the speed of sound. 
     
     
     43.  INT. DAY - TOP GUN ORIENTATION ROOM.
     
     
     VIPER - A tough-looking, confident leader in a blue flight suit, 
     stands before a video-tape monitor. Behind him, on the monitor, 
     the dogfighting continues.
     
               VIPER
     By the end of Vietnam we upped our 
     kill ratio to thirteen to one. 
     
     
     He turns on the lights. We see his audience in F.G.
     
               VIPER
     You're here 'cause you're the top 
     one per cent of all naval aviators.
     
     THE CLASS 
     
     Sixteen young men - eight flight crews - sit at attention. They 
     are trim, fit and confident - high school heroes, college jocks.
     
               VIPER (V.O.) 
     You're the elite, the best of the 
     best. We're gonna make you better, 
     because you're job is damned 
     important. 
     
     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE MEN 
     
     The camera moves among them. Hold on one of the men; the one who 
     greeted Maverick at the gate, Ice.
     
               VIPER (V.O.)
     With the tensions in the world today, the potential for confron- 
     tation is greater than ever, and 
     carrier pilots will be the first 
     ones there. Air combat excellence 
     is vital.
     
     
     Ice is not looking at the speaker, but, rather, in our 
     direction. HOLLYWOOD, a blond, good-looking pilot, whispers 
     something to him, and gestures. Ice is getting the lowdown on 
     someone. The camera moves and we see who that someone is, as 
     Maverick enters the frame. 
     
               VIPER
      ...Someone once asked me if 
     training men for air combat made 
     the world less safe--flying loaded 
     guns... an accidental confrontation 
     and so forth...
     
     Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his 
     direction. Their eyes meet. Ice smiles coldly.
     
     
     ANGLE - VIPER 
                VIPER (Con't)
     My answer is: the dangerous thing 
     is being unprepared. You want 
     trouble, that's what you get when 
     things don't work out, when you 
     can't do what you say you can. When 
     you don't know what you can do. And 
     when your opponents aren't sure 
     either. We are not policy. We don't 
     make policy. Elected officials 
     ...civilians, do that. We are the 
     instrument of policy. The tip of 
     the spear. So we had best be sharp.
     
     Maverick has turned to look at Ice. Ice glances back in his 
     direction. Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in 
     blue flight suits stand. They are the instructors. They look 
     relaxed, poised, mean.  Goose is looking up front...Where Viper 
     has stopped. Goose nudges Maverick. 
     
               GOOSE
        (whispers)
     What are you doing?
     
               MAVERICK
     Nothing...That's McGown...that's 
     Singer, isn't it?
               GOOSE
     Turn around, pay attention. What 
     are you doing?
     
               MAVERICK
         (musing to himself)
     ...Just wondering...(turns back) 
     ...who is the best.
     
     
     He's shocked to find Viper staring right at him, with a killer 
     grin on his face. He's feels caught like a naughty schoolboy.
     
               VIPER
     Really...    (smiles)
     Ya know. We'd like to know who's 
     best too. That's why we've got that 
     plaque on the wall... with the Top 
     Top Gun crew from each class. You 
     think maybe your name's gonna be on 
     it?
     
     Maverick knows he's in trouble, considers the social 
     alternatives, then tells him the truth.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir.
     
     A couple of ooo's and aahh's from the guys. The instructors 
     stare the challenge at him. He slides lower in his seat.
     
               VIPER
     Considering the company you're in, 
     that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
     
               MAVERICK
         (somewhat chastised)
     Yes sir.
     
               VIPER
     I like that in a fighter pilot.  
     (couple of laughs from the guys) 
     It's okay to be confident. You have 
     to think you're King Kong to want 
     to try to land on carriers. Just 
     keep in mind the other component of 
     success...teamwork.
     
     Viper gathers his notes, the lecture is over.
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir.
     
     Viper turns back for one more thought.
     
               VIPER
     Gentlemen, this is about combat. 
     Remember, there are no points for 
     second place. Dismissed.
     Viper walks out. Maverick finds Goose looking at him, 
     quizzically. Others mill around the plaque.  A big, friendly bear 
     of a RIO speaks.
     
     
     
               WOLFMAN
     A plaque?
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     It's not the plaque. The winner can 
     get assigned here as instructor. He 
     gets to fight every day.
     
     They move closer to examine the names on the plaque.
     
     
     44.  EXT. "O" CLUB - NIGHT.
     
     Fast cars in the driveway, fast music blares into the 
     night. It's Wednesday; Animal Night. Maverick, Goose 
     Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance.
     
     
     
     45.  INT. WOXOF BAR
     
     
     Loud music, low ceiling, plaques of the squadrons line the 
     walls. A dancer gyrates on stage, largely ignored by pilots 
     talking with their hands. Every pretty girl in San Diego 
     seems to be here. It's a noisy, rowdy place--a "steam 
     releaser" for people under pressure. Nevertheless, there is 
     a control to it all, there are none of the usual bar types, 
     just pilots and Naval Officers.
     
     The Ghost Riders enter. The place is on fire:  a mob of 
     dancers, flashing lights, blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC. Beer 
     flows. Pilots talk flying and hustle girls.
     
     NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar. He knows Goose and 
     speaks loudly for his benefit.. 
     
               A7 PILOT
     You know the Fighter Pilots motto? 
     It's better to be dead than to look 
     bad.
     
     They grin broadly. Goose replies as they brush past.
     
               GOOSE
     I don't know, Frank, anybody gets 
     off on bombing the shit out of dirt 
     has got to be queer.
     
     Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots. 
     Maverick's introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the 
     music. Maverick is a bit reserved. He doesn't move among the 
     crowd as naturally as Goose does. Hollywood and Wolfman drift 
     
     away, searching for quarry. Goose orders beer. He nods toward a 
     TALL YOUNG MAN across the room.
     
               GOOSE
     Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew 
     him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
     
               MAVERICK
     Is there anybody in the Navy you 
     don't know? 
     
               GOOSE
     Gotta keep track of the 
     competition.
     
     Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past.
     
               GOOSE
     Slider -- they let you into Top 
     Gun? If you're among the best in 
     the Navy, I tremble for the 
     security of this country.
     
               SLIDER
     Why Goose, whose butt did you kiss 
     to get here?
     
               GOOSE
     The list is long, but 
     distinguished.
     
               SLIDER
     So's my Johnson.
     
               GOOSE
     This is Maverick.
     
     Smiles good-naturedly, shakes hands with Mav. 
     
               SLIDER
     So I've heard.
     
               GOOSE
     Who's your pilot?
     
               SLIDER
     Tom Kazansky.
     
               GOOSE
         (very impressed)
     No shit. The Iceman....
     
               SLIDER
     Mister to you.
     
     
               GOOSE
     You think you can stay up with us.
     
               SLIDER
     I think, yeah, we'll show you a 
     thing or two.
     
               GOOSE
     This is Evan Mitchell, he steers 
     the thing. 
     
               SLIDER
     So I heard. Steers it pretty close. 
     Sorry to hear about Cougar. He was 
     a good man.
     
               MAVERICK
     Still is..
               SLIDER
     Yeah. That's what I meant.
     
     Suddenly, behind them, a flame shoots up. Someone ducks his head 
     and swallows it. The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar.
     
               SLIDER
     What was that?
     
               GOOSE
     Flaming Hooker. Sort of an 
     institution around here. Or maybe 
     this is the institution, I forget 
     which. It's the house drink. It'll 
     warm the cockles of your heart ... 
     and other things depending on where 
     you spill it.
     
     He motions to the barmaid and she moves over, sets them up. 
     GOOSE holds a demitasse glass. The barmaid pours Drambuie. They 
     look at Goose apprehensively. Goose looks at nearby flyers in 
     Camo fatigues.
               GOOSE
     You can't show fear in front of 
     Marines...They're like Doberman's 
     they'll go for your throat, it's 
     instinctive.
     
     He takes out match and lights it. Maverick holds his arm.
     
               MAVERICK
     You ever done this before?
     
               GOOSE
     What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
     
     
     He downs it all in one gulp, slaps the glass on the bar, still 
     aflame. He stands there, blinking. 
     
               SLIDER
     How was it?
     
               GOOSE
     Could use a dash more jet fuel.
     
     The others are duly impressed. Maverick's gaze falls on Ice 
     watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one, Maverick 
     takes one too, downs it in a gulp. Sundown, taking up the 
     challenge, motions for one. The barmaid pours it.
     
               GOOSE
     Careful, don't make an ash of 
     yourself...
     
     He tries to drink the flaming concoction. He tries to go for a 
     sip, but it's too close to his face, he tries to tilt the flame 
     away, but that doesn't work. Finally he goes for the gulp. He 
     burns his lip and misses.  He sets his hair on fire. It goes up 
     in a WHOOOSH!!
     
               SUNDOWN
     Yeow!
     
               GOOSE
     Mayday! Down in flames! 
     
     He throws a beer in Sundown's face, quenching the fire. Sundown 
     blinks through the beer.
     
               SUNDOWN
     Thanks, I needed that.
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     You guys are not only crazy, you're 
     dangerous!
     
     Ice comes up from the end of the bar. He motions the Barmaid for 
     another; it comes. Goose lights it. He gulps it down, cool as 
     hell.
               ICE
         (Disdainfully)
     Frat boys.
     
     
     He walks away. Slider goes after him.
     
               MAVERICK
     Who is that guy?
     
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     That's Kazanski.
     
               GOOSE
     No shit! That why they call him Ice?
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     Nope. It's the way he flies - Ice cold. 
     No mistakes. Wears you down. After 
     enough time, you just get bored and 
     frustrated, you do something stupid, and 
     he's got you.
     
     Maverick moves in Ice's direction. He passes Wolfman dancing 
     with a girl with bright purple fingernails.
     
     ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR.
     
               GIRL
     Why do you all have such funny 
     names?
     
               WOLFMAN
     You gotta have a call sign that's 
     just your own...never changes...you 
     have to recognize it immediately. 
     Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, 
     break left!"..you react right away.
     
               GIRL
     Why do they call you Wolf?
     
               WOLDFMAN
        (smiles)
     Oh, I don't know.
     
     Goose comes up with his arm around a girl.
     
               GOOSE
     Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't 
     believe a word I say. Tell her I'm 
     married, will you?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yeah, he's married--but then again, 
     he,s not dead.
     
     Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance 
     floor. Something in Maverick's eyes makes him hang back with his 
     partner.
     ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS
     
               GIRL
     Could I get a call sign?
     
     
               WOLFMAN
     Well, I don't know. That depends.
     
               GIRL
     On what?
     
               WOLFMAN
     Well, it doesn't just happen, you 
     gotta do something famous.
     
               GIRL
     Like what?
     
               WOLFMAN
     Oh...I'll think of something.
     
     Maverick smiles at this, but seems on edge... He watches a few 
     pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits, then 
     turns and walks up to Ice, who sits, drinking with Slider.
     Maverick walks over to him. Ice notices Slider's attention going 
     to Maverick. He turns and grins at him.
     
               ICEMAN
     Figured it out yet?
     
               MAVERICK
     Figured out what?
     
               ICEMAN
     Who is the best.
     
               MAVERICK
     Nope.
     
               ICEMAN
     Need a hint?
     
               MAVERICK
     I think I can work it out on my 
     own.
     
               ICEMAN
     You like to work alone. I've heard 
     that about you. 
     
               MAVERICK
     I've heard of you, too. You were in 
     124 with Bargamian.
     
               ICEMAN
     And you were with Cougar. He was my 
     roommate in flight school.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     He's a good man.
               ICEMAN
     The best.
     
               SLIDER
     You must have soloed under a lucky 
     star. First the MiG, then you slide 
     into Cougar's place.
     
               GOOSE
     It's not Cougar's place. It's ours. 
     
               ICE
     What do you think it was? Was it 
     that MiG contact that did it?
     
               GOOSE
     Did what?
     
               ICE
     Got you here.
     
               GOOSE
     We're here because we're the best 
     flyers in the wing. Not because of 
     some MiG encounter.
     
               SLIDER
     What luck! Guys fly their whole 
     career without seeing a MiG up 
     close...You're famous.
     
               ICE
     You mean notorious.
     
     Something in the way he says it. It's not quite a joke, more an 
     insult. Maverick's about to take the whole conversation too far 
     when something...someone catches his eye. She catches quite a few 
     eyes in this room. She is very pretty and she's walking in on the 
     arm of a Commander. Maverick turns back, but the moment has 
     passed. Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile. Goose pulls 
     him away.
     
               MAVERICK
     What do these guys think, I made 
     Cougar quit?
     
               GOOSE
     Pay no attention to it. They're 
     just trying to rattle you. It's all 
     psychological. Sit down..and drink.
     
     
     He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots 
     cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his wristwatch. 
     Maverick broods...
               BUGS
     We were just really diving down and by 
     then we were right over downtown 
     Haiphong.  It was some great shit. Jack 
     says, "What are you doing?" "What, what 
     am I doing, Jack?" He says, "What are 
     you doing?" I said, "I'm rolling in, 
     Jack." "Bugs, we're at thirty-two 
     hundred feet. Oh shit, we were like 
     zooom... So we scraped down at hundred 
     feet right over--downtown Hanoi!  Oh 
     shit, goddamn it! And blowing down the 
     river. And so once we were there we let 
     down to about fifty feet just going down 
     the river and Jack says... "Bugs... 
     don't ever do that again!" "Okay, right, 
     Jack, I'll never do that again!"
     
     Maverick pays little or no attention. He broods and drinks. 
     Suddenly, Hollywood nudges him, he turns.
     
               MAVERICK
     What, what is it?
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     Target passing. Check your six.
     
               MAVERICK
     Never mind mine. Check hers.
     
     They turn. Long legs, great ass, beautiful.

     Her six is a ten! Uh oh, a turn to

     HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM
     
     Maverick sees a stranger, and somehow he knows, he knows even 
     then.  Wolfman turns, sees her walking too.

     that hostile?
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     
     Well, we should contact and check 
     it out.
     
     
     She has turned toward them. She passes by. They start to make a 
     move for her. But just then she finds her date at the bar; a 
     distinguished man with Captain's stripes. Their smiles freeze and 
     they slide back in their chairs. Maverick can't stop looking at 
     her...After a while, the intensity of his gaze draws her 
     attention. She feels him. She is nodding and smiling to her date, 
     but her eyes scan the room like radar. A warning tone goes off in 
     his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him. He feels that 
     thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know you're 
     targeted in someone's scope. Her eyes hold on him for a long 
     moment...long enough, and then sweep by the rest of the room. She 
     turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something 
     he says.
     
     
     Over in a corner, Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls.
     
               GOOSE
     The family unit -- that's the most 
     important thing. It's the only 
     thing you can count on. I'm married 
     --did I tell you that?
     
               FIRST GIRL
     Four times. We don't believe you.
     
               GOOSE
     I've been married since I was 
     eighteen. Why don't you believe me?
     
               SECOND GIRL
     Because you don't look married. 
     
               FIRST GIRL
     You're not even wearing a ring.
     
               GOOSE
         (big smile)
     I take it off when I'm chasing 
     women. It's the only honorable 
     thing to do.
     
     
     ANGLE - MAVERICK
     
     He's half listening to Bugs rattle on.  His eyes are drawn back 
     to the woman. He tries not to stare. She seems to know a lot of 
     people in the club. He looks away. Hollywood is chatting up a 
     girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught. His line is just as 
     polished as his appearance.
     
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     You don't think about death up 
     there, but you think a lot about 
     the danger. One mistake and you're 
     a smoking hole in the ground.
     
               GIRL
     I never knew it was so dangerous.
               HOLLYWOOD
     Oh yeah, it makes everything down 
     here more meaningful. You feel a 
     certain intensity of life, and you 
     want to grab onto every moment.
     
     Maverick looks up at the bar again. A shock. She (Charlie) is 
     staring right at him, intensely, as her date whispers something 
     in her ear. She notices him, staring back, quickly looks away, 
     embarrassed. She says something to the man. He nods and turns 
     away as someone else grabs his attention. The woman, now wouldn't 
     look this way for anything. She picks up her purse from the bar 
     and walks through the crowd and out of the room. Impulsively, 
     Maverick's up, he follows. 
     
     
     46.  INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR
     
     He breaks out, looks around, doesn't see her. Someone disappears 
     around a corner. He moves after.
     
     CORNER - A door slams shut. Impulsively, before he realizes what 
     he is doing, he's through it. 
     
     
     47.  WOMEN'S ROOM. 
     
     A feminine GASP!  He should have looked at the sign on the door. 
     The realization of where he is hits him too late. She is standing 
     by the mirror, with her make-up out, looking back at him. He's 
     not quite sure what to do. A hasty retreat would be appropriate, 
     if embarrassing. Ah, what the hell, he is a fighter pilot!  He 
     just walks right over to her...no idea what he will say. She's 
     got her lipstick out, twisting it. She looks over at him with an 
     amused smile.
     
               CHARLIE
     Long cruise, was it?
     
     She leans over the sink, puts on lipstick, sees his eyes cover 
     her.
     
               CHARLIE
     Anything I can do to help, Lieutenant?
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Lots of things. 
     
     She laughs. He is sort of attractive, but there are other girls 
     in the room, she doesn't want to be too encouraging...She tries 
     not to grin at his embarrassment.
     
               CHARLIE
     I'll bet!
     
               MAVERICK
     Uhhh...Anything I can do for you?
     She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, 
     but she's instinctively attracted.
     
               CHARLIE
     Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
     
     She hands him a makeup mirror. Starts redoing her lipstick. He 
     just stares at her...She looks up at him, than back to her 
     warpaint. Finally, when it comes, it is cool and amused.
     
               CHARLIE
     Now I know why all the girls come 
     here. They know how horny you guys 
     get. But this...is ridiculous.
     
               MAVERICK
     It's not that.
     
     Mock anger. She's toying with him.
     
               CHARLIE
     It isn't?
     
               MAVERICK
     Well, it is. It is that, too.
     
               CHARLIE
     That's a big comfort to me.
     
               MAVERICK
     I could be, too.
     
                CHARLIE
     How so?
     
               MAVERICK
     Save you from a big mistake with 
     that other guy.
     
               CHARLIE
     And on to a bigger one with you?
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Yeah, most likely.
     
               CHARLIE
     Was there ever a girl who didn't 
     like fighter pilots?
     
               MAVERICK
     I heard of one once.
     
     She laughs again, shakes her head...another cowboy! She gently 
     takes the compact out of his hands, snaps it closed.
     
               CHARLIE
     I'm really flattered, Lieutenant, 
     but I don't go out with pilots.
               MAVERICK
     Then what are you doing here?
     
     Three pretty blondes enter and look at Maverick quizzically but 
     not without interest.
     
               CHARLIE
     I think the question is...what are 
     you?
     
     She tries to keep a straight face as she walks out of the room. 
     
     The other girls look at him expectantly.  A beat.  He just 
     stands there, then realizes he's holding her lipstick. 
     
               MAVERICK
     Hi. I'm here to talk about a new 
     concept in cosmetics...
     
     47A.  WOXOF BAR. She returns, spots the Captain, motioning to 
     her.  Maverick enters, goes to the other end of the bar. He 
     orders a drink. It comes. He drinks it, pays for it, moves off 
     toward the door. Someone backs into his path, he moves quickly 
     and bumps into someone else; her. 
     
               CHARLIE
     Sorry.
     
     She sees it's him.
     
               MAVERICK
     My fault. Should have watched
     where I was going.
     
     Her hand goes to his collar. She adjusts his insignia. She 
     smiles.
     
               CHARLIE
     
     Where's your wing man? Who's 
     watching your six?
     
               MAVERICK
     Uh, nobody, I guess.
     
     One final adjustment.
     
               CHARLIE
     Too bad.
     
     She breaks the spell abruptly, turns away.
     
               CHARLIE
     See you around.
     
     Maverick finds his voice.
     
               MAVERICK
     Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
     
               CHARLIE
     I'm with someone. 
     
     
     48.  EXT. "O" CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
     
     P.O.V. - 
     
     From a car in the parking lot, we see Charlie and the Captain 
     leave the club. They walk directly toward us and stop. She turns, 
     says something polite...a peck on the cheek. He turns away. A 
     dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a door 
     opens. It rocks slightly as someone gets in. Charlie turns back 
     and walks over, taking her keys out. She opens the door to the 
     car and gets in. 
     
     
     48A.  EXT. CAR - NIGHT
     
     She starts the car and pulls away. Suddenly, a figure sits up in 
     the back.
     
               MAVERICK
     I thought he'd never leave.
     
               CHARLIE
     Yeow!
     
     Startled, she nearly drives off the road. She turns to him, 
     startled.
     
               CHARLIE
     You! What are you doing here?
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Everybody's got to be somewhere.
     
               CHARLIE
     What if Captain Dawson had come 
     with me?
     
               MAVERICK
     It would have been really 
     embarrassing!
     
               CHARLIE
     How did you know this was my car?
     
               MAVERICK
     Simple deduction. It's fast. It's 
     pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's 
     your color...matches your lipstick.
     
               CHARLIE
     That's all!
     
               MAVERICK
     And I asked someone.
               CHARLIE
     You think you're pretty smart.
     
               MAVERICK
     I think I'm in love.
     
     
     49.  EXT. GUARD GATE
     
     She pulls up at the guard gate, a MARINE CORPORAL is on duty. He 
     sees the pretty girl pull up and stop, leans over helpfully.
     
               MARINE
     Can I help you, Ma'am?
     
     She smiles even more sweetly.
     
               CHARLIE
     I don't know, Corporal. Can you do 
     anything about this lunatic?
     
     The car door swings open. Maverick gets out. The car roars away. 
     He stands in the glare of the spotlight...rocking on his heels, 
     looking across at the guard, who snaps to attention and stares 
     holes in his chest.
     
     
     50.  INT. TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING. 
     
     
     Two guys in flight suits run down stairs past stencils of MiG 
     kills on walls, then down corridor.
     
               FLEX
     Not so fast...my head.
     
     They skid to stop outside a door.
     
     
     51.  INT. HANGAR
     
     Ground crews work on planes in B.G. Jester in middle of lecture.
     Door bursts open. Sundown and Flex skid to a halt when they see 
     whole class looking at them.
     
               JESTER
     Who are you?
     
               SUNDOWN
     I'm Sundown.
     
               JESTER
     Yeah, right. You're late.
     
     
     Viper breaks in, indicating Flex.
     
               VIPER
     And who are you?
     
               FLEX
     Flex 
     
               VIPER
     Flex...? You don't look like Flex  
     to me. You call that muscle? 
     Doesn't look like muscle. Looks 
     like...Pork.
     
     They laugh. Even Sundown has to laugh, scratching his chest.
     
               VIPER
     What're you laughing at? You're 
     Fungus.
     
     Stops scratching.
               SUNDOWN/FUNGUS
     Fungus!
     
               PORK
     Don't make an issue of it, it'll 
     stick.
     
               FUNGUS (Unhappily)
     
     It'll stick anyway. 
     
     Viper turns away...
     
               VIPER
     Now to continue. In this class we 
     will be dealing with F-5's and 
     A4's, as our MiG simulators. 
     Technically the F-5 does not have 
     the thrust to weight ratio of the 
     MiG-21--it also does not bleed 
     energy below 300 knots like the 
     MiG-21 does. The A4 does not turn 
     as well as the MiG-17 but has 
     significantly better visibility.
     
     Maverick looks back to his notes. SFX footsteps...door 
     opening. Viper looks up to back of room door.
     
               VIPER
     Hi, Charlie. Good, our TAGREF's 
     here. Charlie's the most qualified 
     to get into P subs and curves, and 
     VN diagrams.
     
     Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward.  Maverick 
     stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him. He is 
     surprised, embarrassed.
     
               VIPER
     Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie-- 
     not your ordinary TAGREF. Charlie has 
     her Ph.D. in astrophysics--she's a 
     civilian contractor so you don't salute 
     her...or anything else. Is that clear?
     
     She walks to the front and starts her presentation. She 
     talks about something very technical, arcane. MiG tactics, 
     technology. As the briefing rattles on, Maverick reacts to 
     her. Goose glances over at him. He, too, recognizes the girl. 
     He looks at his partner. Maverick feels his stare.
     
               CHARLIE
     Hello, I think I have some new data for 
     you...Now a MiG 21 has a problem with 
     the inverted flight tanks. It won't do a 
     Negative G push over. Even below one G, 
     they risk a flame out. Operationally, 
     they will do a zero to one G only.
     
     A snicker from the audience. She hesitates momentarily, goes 
     on.
               CHARLIE
     
     The latest intelligence shows that 
     the most they will do in operation 
     is one....is there something wrong, 
     Lieutenant.
     
               MAVERICK
     I don't think you're altogether 
     right...about the MiG, that is.
     
     She stops--some of the pilots look at him. Viper glares.
     
               CHARLIE
     I beg your pardon.
     
               MAVERICK
     No, I beg yours. But I don't think 
     you're right on that.
     
               CHARLIE
     Why not?
     
               MAVERICK
     I saw one.
     
               CHARLIE
     You saw a MiG 21?
     
               MAVERICK
     I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
     
               CHARLIE
         (She doesn't believe him)
     Where did you see that?
     
               MAVERICK
     It's classified.
     
     Nervous buzz in the room. Viper goes rigid. Charlie can't 
     believe it.
     
               CHARLIE
     It's what?
     
               MAVERICK
     It's classified. Like Hollywood 
     says, I could tell you, but then 
     I'd have to kill you.
     
     Pork stifles a laugh, the others chuckle. Viper is 
     embarrassed.
     
               VIPER
     Maverick!!!
     
     
     She stops Viper with a glance.
     
               CHARLIE
     It's all right.
     
     She can handle it. She is very cool, not overbearing. She 
     says it calmly. She doesn't want to embarrass him any more 
     than he is, but she has to get the facts straight.
     
               CHARLIE
      Lieutenant, I have a top secret 
     clearance. The Pentagon sees to it 
     that I know more than you.
     
               MAVERICK
     Not in this case.
               CHARLIE
         (Flatly.)
     You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes, ma'am.
     
               CHARLIE
     Where were you?
     
               MAVERICK
     On his six.
     
     Little stifled laughs.
     
               CHARLIE
     He was in a 4G Negative dive and 
     you were on his six?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was 
     directly above him.
     
     She stares at him for a moment, then she has him. She goes 
     for the kill.
     
               CHARLIE
     If you were directly above him, how 
     did you see him?
     
               MAVERICK
     I was inverted.
     
     A real buzz in the room.  Ice laughs audibly.
     
               CHARLIE
     You were in a 4G inverted dive with 
     a MiG 21?   (She can't believe it.)
     
     At what range ?
     
               MAVERICK
     Two.
     
               CHARLIE
     Two miles.
     
               MAVERICK
     Two meters.
     
     
     Chuckles, barely suppressed. Goose pipes up to deflect 
     attention.
     
               GOOSE
     One and a half, actually. I got a 
     polaroid.
     
               CHARLIE
         (Flatly.)
     Lieutenant...
               MAVERICK
     Ma'am?
     
               CHARLIE
     What were you doing there?
     
               MAVERICK
     Giving him the bird.
     
     Open laughter. She thinks it's at her. She grows red.
     
               CHARLIE
     The what?
     
               MAVERICK
     You know. The finger.
     
     He shows her, but she can handle this. 
     
               CHARLIE
     So you're the reason those
     SALT talks failed.
     
     The room breaks into laughter. At him. Now he grows red. 
     Goose puts his hand on Maverick's arm, shakes his head as if 
     to say: "Let it go, pal, she got you". 
     
     She looks at Viper. He doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. 
     He knows there's something here he doesn't control.
     
               VIPER
     Lieutenant!
     
     
               GOOSE
     It's just like he says, sir.
     
               VIPER
         (He snaps)
     I don't care!

     She walks away. He runs up and stops her.
     
               MAVERICK
     Why didn't you tell me you were a 
     TAGREF?
     
     She studies him coolly for a moment, like a specimen.
     
               CHARLIE
     It never came up.
     
               MAVERICK
     You let me make a fool of myself.
     
               CHARLIE
     You seemed determined to do that 
     anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you 
     were a famous MiG insulter?
               MAVERICK
     Would it have made a difference? 
     
               CHARLIE
     No.
     
               MAVERICK
     What would?
     
               CHARLIE
     You know, I'm assigned to this 
     school. I see sixteen new hotshots 
     every eight weeks. Your attention 
     is flattering, but not really 
     productive. Why don't you keep your 
     mind on flying.
     
     She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia.
     
               CHARLIE
     Why can't you keep this straight?
     
     She smiles at him and walks away. Maverick turns, sees the 
     others sizing him up. Most of them grin. Maverick moves down 
     the corridor past the CO's Office. Viper leans against the 
     
     doorsill. He lights a pipe, laconically eyes Maverick. His 
     tone gives away nothing, like an ELINT probe eliciting a 
     response.
     
               VIPER
     Maverick... Where'd you get that 
     call sign?
     
               MAVERICK
     Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
     
               VIPER
     You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir.
     
               VIPER
     A good man. Good flyer.
     
     Viper turns away. 
     
               MAVERICK
     Yes sir. Thank you sir.
     
     Maverick watches him for a beat, he's been tested, but he's 
     not sure how or why. He turns to catch up with Goose and the 
     others.
     
     EXT. SKY - LATER
     
     At twenty-eight thousand feet, the two planes circle each 
     other, going in opposite directions. As they jockey for 
     position, they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips.
     
     The earth spins, the horizon appears and disappears. With 
     each hard turn, Maverick and Goose can be heard "grunting" to 
     keep blood in their brains, to keep from passing out.
     
     The fight is hard, physical, and exhausting. The extreme G 
     forces--6.5--flatten them against their seats, causing their 
     heads to weigh over one hundred pounds. Maverick strains to 
     turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at 
     Mach One. 
               MAVERICK
     I've lost him -- where is he?
     
               GOOSE
     On your six -- coming hard. Four 
     hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on 
     your six and closing fast!
     Hard left! HARD LEFT!
     
     
     Maverick jerks the stick left, and the F-14 takes an 
     astonishing turn. Jester ROARS past into a wide arc.
     
               GOOSE
     Great move. Great
     
               MAVERICK
     He should've had me.
               GOOSE
     Take it down. Let's bug out of 
     here. Call for a draw.
     
               MAVERICK
     No way. I'll nail him this time. 
     Going vertical.
     
     
     THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward 
     space. Jester is left in direct line with the sun, and his 
     canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare. Going ballistic is 
     dangerous. The plane flys like a bullet, obeying the laws of 
     physics, not the pilot's touch on control surfaces. The 
     ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is, for the 
     moment, out of control.
     
               GOOSE
     He's blind -- you got him!
     
               JESTER
     NO JOY! NO JOY! WHERE ARE YOU?
     I'VE LOST SIGHT.
     
               GOOSE
     He's out of energy! You got 
     control? Unload!
     
     The F-14 peels over the egg, in a backward dive. It rockets 
     down the outside, gaining energy. Over the ROAR of jets, the 
     SCREAM of the wind, Goose shouts data, but it is muffled, a 
     distant voice in a typhoon. Through the canopy, we see 
     Jester, and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of 
     a falcon.
     
     PILOT'S POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box. 
     Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester, and we hear the 
     high pitched tone BEEPING.
     
               JESTER
     WE'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK. FIGHT'S 
     OFF.
     
               GOOSE
     He's right. We're at ten thousand.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     No way. I got you, sucker. You're 
     going down.
     
     Jester maneuvers, but Maverick keeps him in the gunsight. 
     The BEEPING is louder, faster.
     
               MAVERICK
     In the envelope. FOX TWO MISSILE 
     SHOT. YOU'RE GONE, JESTER, DEAD! 
               GOOSE
         (stunned)
     Goddamn! We beat him!
     
     There is an edge of anger in Jester's voice.
     
               JESTER
     ROGER FOX TWO. GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE 
     THE HARD DECK. RETURN TO BASE 
     IMMEDIATELY.
                   
     They are brought up short for a moment, then the thrill of 
     victory gets the best of them. Goose lets out a war whoop. 
     The F-14 sweeps up, rolls into an Immelman..
     
               MAVERICK
     We did it!
     
               GOOSE
     Look, Ma, top of the world!
     
     
     52A.  EXT. MIRAMAR - LANDING PATTERN.
     
     Maverick's Tomcat breaks hard and high, rolls over on its 
     side, wings perpendicular to the ground. Goose sees the world 
     go sideways.
     
               GOOSE
     Ahhh...A little high on the left, 
     don't you think?
     
               MAVERICK
     Right.
     
     He aileron rolls another quarter turn. Inverted, they pass 
     right down the runway.  Goose looks out and insouciantly 
     watches the world go by at 300 knots, upside down.
     
               GOOSE
     Right. Much better. ...Ahhh...what 
     do you call this?
     
     
     
               MAVERICK
     It's a victory roll.
     
               GOOSE
     I wouldn't call it victory.  It's 
     more like...self immolation.
     
     
     52B.  INT. CONTROL TOWER 
     
     Controllers work. Officers watch the landing activity. One 
     old salt, turns from the coffee machine, a cup of steaming 
     Java microns from his lips. A ROAR. VABOOM! The Tomcat roars 
     over. He yelps as hot coffee flys all over his shirt.         
                                                         52C.

     They complete the roll, bank left, zoom right by the tower, 
     level with the observation window.

     52F.  EXT. FLIGHTLINE. 
     
     Maverick and Goose walk by parking Tomcats...Ice is 
     unstrapping, Slider is climbing down. Ice looks at Maverick, 
     says one word.
     
               ICEMAN
     Cowboys!
     
     Maverick keeps walking...Goose hangs back.
     
               SLIDER
     Nice. Always a good idea to show up 
     your instructors.
     He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose 
     indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
     
               GOOSE
     Hey, see any controls back there? 
        (thinks about team loyalty, 
        reacts to Jester's glare...)
     And anyway...we beat the Son of a 
     Bitch!
     
     He turns and runs to catch up with Maverick.
     
     
     53.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     
     Pilots half undressed. Maverick and Goose enter the room, 
     carrying their helmets. The students look up at them, and 
     Goose suddenly flashes a thumb's up sign with a grin. The 
     students react with clenched fists, ad libs, high fives, 
     victory punches.
     
               WOLFMAN
     You won?!!!
     
               MAVERICK
     Didn't everybody?
     
     "Oooo" -- they all go "ooo" and laugh.
                                                      
               WOLFMAN

     go?
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     And he's laughing. Right over the 
     radio, He's laughing at us.
     
     Attention turns to the doorway as Ice and Slider enter. Ice 
     gives a brief dramatic pause, then flashes thumbs up and 
     smiles. The students celebrate Ice's win.  Ice handles the 
     attention with the easy composure of one who is used to it. 
     Maverick ignores him and begins to peel out of his G-suit. 
     Ice moves toward his locker.

     Ice talks into his locker.
     
               ICE
     That's not what I heard.
     
               GOOSE

     Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his 
     locker, dismissing them.
     
               ICE
     Below the hard deck doesn't count. 
     You guys are the second team, 
     aren't you?
     
     Maverick gets up, moves to him, starts to say something, 
     when Jester, breaks into the room.
     
               JESTER

     53A. INT. TOPGUN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE CO'S OFFICE.
     
     
     SCREAMING AND YELLING.  A lot of screaming and yelling, 
     muffled by the door.
     
                                                                  
     53B. INT. ANTEROOM. 
     
     Enlisted Yeomen and Chiefs go about their clerical duties in 
     acute embarrassment mixed with curiousity. Behind the CO'S door, 
     someone is screaming his head off.
     
     
     BOOM! The door bursts open. A big, brawling Officer - Johnson, 
     the Air Boss - blasts out, nearly smashing into a female petty 
     officer. She almost spills her coffee. Johnson looks right and 
     left in fury too strong for words. He looks like he wants to 
     smash something. They move out of his way, but he justs blasts 
     through the door and disappears down the hall.
     The enlisted men turn to Viper's office.
     
     
     53D  THEIR POV
     
     Jester stands inside stonefaced. Maverick and Goose are 
     rigid. Viper...with excess calm deliberation, softly walks 
     over, grasps the doornob. He glances in this direction. The 
     glance is totally without expression, and even scarier for 
     that.

     In a flash, each man finds something totally engrossing in 
     his work, or something terribly important to do elsewhere. 
     Slowly, steadily, Viper swings his door closed.54.  INT. 
     VIPER'S OFFICE 
     
     He moves over to face Maverick. There is a SILENCE like 
     after a train wreck; nothing but the POPPING of sprung metal 
     and the low GASP of escaping steam. Viper speaks quietly, 
     like a funeral director consoling the living. Makes you want 
     to scream.
     
               VIPER
     Well....That about covers the 
     flyby. 
     
     Jester almost breaks into a grin.
     
               VIPER
     Now...in addition...you broke two 
     major rules of engagement. And... 
     That's ...not good.
     
     
     Maverick gives no response. Viper continues.
     
               VIPER
     Lieutenant Candela lost sight of 
     you, and called "no joy". You 
     failed to respond. 
     
     He stops and looks at Maverick... A beat. Maverick finally 
     nods 
               VIPER
     Why?
     
     
     Maverick is exhausted. It's been a long, rough day. His 
     voice is a horse whisper.
     
               MAVERICK
     I had him in view. I was peeling 
     over the egg, into a dive. He saw 
     me when I moved in for the kill. 
     There wasn't any danger...
     
               VIPER
         (to Goose)
     Is that how you remember it?
     
               GOOSE
     Yes, sir. By the time we could 
     respond, we were diving right into 
     his view.
     
     Viper is not satisfied with the answer, but he moves on.
     
               VIPER
     The hard deck for this hop was ten 
     thousand feet. Jester, at what 
     point did you call off the fight?
     
               JESTER
     Just below ten thousand.
     
               VIPER
     But you continued to fight.
     
     Another pause, another grudging nod.
     
               VIPER
     Why?
     
               MAVERICK
     We weren't below for more than ten 
     seconds. There was no danger. I had 
     the shot. I took it.
     
               VIPER
     The rules of engagement are not 
     flexible. They exist for your  
     safety. You will obey them.
     Is that clear?
     
     Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion, but the 
     thought is momentary. He quickly cuts his losses, gives Viper 
     what he thinks he wants...He is just on the cusp of too 
     sincere.
     
               MAVERICK
     
     Yes sir, perfectly clear. I guess 
     we were ...I was... just a little 
     over enthusiastic.
     
     Viper measures him for a moment, then lets it go.
     
               VIPER
     I guess you were. Dismissed.
     
     Maverick and Goose leave the room. Viper looks at Jester, 
     picks up Maverick's fitness report. Doesn't read it, looks 
     back at Jester.
     
               JESTER
     I don't know what to tell you, 
     Skip.
     
               VIPER
     Tell me one thing.
     
     Jester waits.
     
     
               VIPER
     ...If you had to go into combat, 
     would you want him with you?
     
     Jester turns, walks slowly around the room. The walls are 
     lined with pictures; planes and pilots...history. There are 
     MiG killers, attack squadrons, ground personnel...There's one 
     picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning 
     the camera. Other pictures show carriers, famous flyers, 
     previous CO's. Finally Jester replys.   
     
               JESTER
     Yep.
     
     Viper slaps shut the fitness report. 
     
               JESTER
     He's seat of the pants... 
     Completely unpredictable -- nothing 
     by the book. All over the sky. But 
     I don't know, Skip, he's really got 
     something.

     56B. SIMULATOR CONTROL ROOM - Filled with computers, tape 
     transports and video screen representations of computer 
     generated combat. Now Maverick flies it as Charlie and other 
     techs watch.
     
     56C. COCKPIT
     
     Maverick flys the heck out of it. It's real. It lurches and 
     bumps, the NOISES and sights look real. He gets on the tail 
     of a MiG. It breaks, he breaks, then what he does is just too 
     fast to follow. It screams around in a turn. Suddenly, there 
     is a WHUMMP...ALARMS...the lights come on.
     
               GOOSE
     What happened.
     
               TECH (V.O. FILTERED)
     What did you do in there?
     
               GOOSE
     What did you do? You broke it!
     58. COMPUTER ANALYSIS ROOM 
     
     Maverick and Goose enter. The techs cluster around the 
     keyboards trying to reprogram, to figure out what went wrong.
     
               CHARLIE
     You flew it off the template. 
     Nobody ever did that before.
     
               GOOSE
     That's what she said last night.
     
     She stares at Goose until he grins and moves off to give the 
     others his valuable opinions on how to reprogram the 
     computers.
     
               CHARLIE
     What is it about you?
     
     He just shrugs at her and smiles.
     
               MAVERICK
     What would you say, too fast...too 
     quick...
     
               CHARLIE
     And far too aggressive.
     
               MAVERICK
     It is combat. Every second counts. 
     
               CHARLIE
     
     The hottest moves in the world 
     aren't gonna help you if you wind 
     up alone.  Your wingman's got to be 
     able to follow you. Trust you. Know 
     that he can depend on you. It's 
     more than just fancy flying.
     
               MAVERICK
     Well, what you need...what you have 
     to keep looking for...what you want 
     to get is a wingman who can stay up 
     with you. Who can match you move 
     for move. Then you've got 
     something.  I'm sorry.
     
               CHARLIE
     For what?
     
               MAVERICK
     That stuff about the MiG. I was out 
     of line.
     
               CHARLIE
     Apology acknowledged.
     
               MAVERICK
     Is that all?
               CHARLIE
     What else do you want?
     
               MAVERICK
     Um. You.
     
               CHARLIE
     There you go with those moves 
     again.
     
               MAVERICK
     Too aggressive?
     
               CHARLIE
     I don't mix with the boys. I work 
     here. Let's keep it professional.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm special.
     
               CHARLIE
        (laughs)
     Yes. I'll give you that!
     
               MAVERICK
     Give me a break, I'm asking you 
     out.
     
     
               CHARLIE
     I can't.
     
               MAVERICK
     I thought there was something... 
     That night in the club...
     
               CHARLIE
     Lieutenant...
     
               MAVERICK
     Evan... or Maverick.
     
               CHARLIE
     Maverick...you know the rules of 
     engagement.
     
               MAVERICK
         (can't believe it.)
          The what?
     
               CHARLIE
     Some one comes up hot on your six, 
     what do you do?
     
               MAVERICK
     What are you talking about?
     
               CHARLIE
     You turn into him, check him out, 
     identify friend or foe.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm not your foe.
               CHARLIE
     And if he's harmless, you 
     disengage.
     
               MAVERICK
     Harmless!
     
               CHARLIE
     Uh hum.
     
               MAVERICK
     What if he's not?
     
               CHARLIE
     You have to shoot him down....If 
     he's smart, he'll turn away before 
     that happens.
     
               MAVERICK
     
     Harmless. Nobody ever called me 
     harmless before...
     
               CHARLIE
     And probably never again. It's 
     nothing personal. It's just...I 
     know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm 
     immune...
     
               MAVERICK
     Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And 
     I don't give up. Everything I've 
     ever wanted I've had to work like 
     hell for. Well, how about it?
     
               CHARLIE
     How about what?
     
               MAVERICK
     How about anything, anything you 
     want to do.
     
               CHARLIE
     Hard to argue with that, isn't 
     it...
     
               MAVERICK
     A date... Coffee... A drink...A 
     walk in the park.
     
               CHARLIE
     What about the plane?
     
               MAVERICK
     What plane.
     
               CHARLIE
     Most of them invite me to sit in 
     the cockpit...play with the levers 
     and things. 
               MAVERICK
     Well, get used to it.
     
               CHARLIE
     Used to what?
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm different. 
     
               CHARLIE
     I'm starting to sense that now.
     
               MAVERICK
     
     You're slow to engage. But you'll 
     come around.
     
     She pushes him out the door
     
               MAVERICK
     Let's make it at eight.
     
               CHARLIE
     Make what?
     
               MAVERICK
     Anything.
     
               CHARLIE
     Okay, anything. Just...go. I've 
     gotta work.
     
     She closes the door, turns back to her screen.

     ***
     59A.  BEACH LA JOLLA - DAY
     
     A day off. Pilots, other personnel are enjoying a day at the 
     beach. There are bikinis, and beer, sunfishes and water 
     skiing. The annual Over-the-Line (a variation of softball) 
     tournament is in progress. The team from the Teddy Kennedy 
     Driving School is whipping another known as Scum de Terre. 
     The pilots are doing pretty well at blowing off steam.
     
     59B.  UNDERSEA
     
     Undulating sea grass. Muffled HISS of the surf. A pretty 
     fish comes into view. A spear shoots through it, and nails it 
     to the ocean floor.
     
     59C.  SHORELINE
     
     Two figures pop to the surface and wade in to the beach. 
     Maverick holds the wriggling fish. Charlie is repulsed. She 
     pulls off her mask and snorkle, follows him in to shore..
     59D. THE BEACH
     
     They flop down. He drops the fish in front of her, sees her 
     reaction at watching its death throes.
     
               CHARLIE
     Why'd you do that?
     
               MAVERICK
        (surprised)
     
     I had the shot.
     
     She looks at him for a moment, then turns away, fiddles with 
     her mask.
     
               MAVERICK
     It dies. We live.
     
               CHARLIE
     You're an animal.
     
               MAVERICK
     That's true. What are you?
     
               CHARLIE
     I don't enjoy watching things 
     suffer.
     
     He smashes the fish on a rock. It is still.
     
               CHARLIE
     No!
     
               MAVERICK
     It's not suffering anymore.
     
               CHARLIE
        (she looks at him strangely,  
        half jokes)
     You're horrible
     
               MAVERICK
     You're not, cause you eat frozen 
     meatballs?   (he puts it down)
     Things die. Every time you breathe, 
     you kill millions of tiny 
     organisms. Every time you eat, 
     something had to die. 
     
               CHARLIE
     You don't have to kill it.
     
               MAVERICK
     Somebody does. It's more honest 
     this way. You do your own dirty 
     work.
     
               CHARLIE
     You ever think about killing 
     another human being?
     
               MAVERICK
     About as much as they think about 
     killing me.
     
     
               CHARLIE
     Does it bother you?
     
               MAVERICK
     They know the rules...(this is too 
     strong for her, she turns away, he 
     comes around to her.) That's the 
     deal. That's why you're up there. 
     It's him or me. That's the price of 
     admission. (she draws away) It 
     bothers you, why? You're part of 
     it. (She stiffens, he's losing her. 
     He softens)  Everybody dies. Most 
     people don't get to die for 
     something.
     
     You don't want to confront it, do 
     you. You want to keep it all clean, 
     cerebral... velocity vectors, 
     wing-load diagrams...You ever been 
     up?
     
               CHARLIE
     Flying?
               MAVERICK
     You use your mind to keep things at 
     a distance. You ever just let go?
     
     She doesn't answer.
     
               MAVERICK
     You know what really scares me? 
     Living too long. Losing my hair and 
     my teeth...and my guts and my wind. 
     And my brains...Sitting in a room 
     with my hands in my lap, watching 
     daytime TV. 
     
               CHARLIE
     You don't believe any of this. You 
     don't think you'll ever die.
     
               MAVERICK
     That's it, of course. When I'm up 
     there and doing it, I'm cheating it 
     every second. I'm subverting all 
     laws...gravity...whatever. I'm 
     skating the edge of it.
     
               CHARLIE
     Winston Churchill.
     
               MAVERICK
     
     What?
     
               CHARLIE
     What he said..."There's nothing so 
     exhilarating as being shot at 
     without result."
     
               MAVERICK
     All you've got is one life. I guess 
     it's worth about the same to every 
     body. You ever see an old woman 
     after her husband has died? And the 
     meaningless years of decline 
     stretch ahead...  When you're in 
     the air and doing something really 
     dangerous, you can look ahead... 
     maybe ten seconds. That's your 
     whole future. That's as far as it 
     goes. But imagine what those 
     seconds are worth.
     
               CHARLIE
     What if you kill yourself? Think of 
     everything you'll miss.
               MAVERICK
     There is lots of stuff I don't know 
     about...  Fine wine... great art... 
     the opera. I guess if I live long 
     enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, 
     I'll never miss it.
     
               CHARLIE
     Are you really that brave?
     
               MAVERICK
         (shakes his head no.)
     I watched my mother die. Cancer. 
     She had a long time to think about 
     it. They say you reach an agreement 
     with death. Come to accept the fact 
     that pretty soon you won't be here. 
     I didn't see that. She... was very 
     brave...braver than I am. You go up 
     there, there isn't time to think. 
     If you make a mistake, you're just 
     a smudge on the ground. Simplifies 
     funeral arrangements.
     
               CHARLIE
     It's just as I thought.
     
               MAVERICK
     What?
     
     
               CHARLIE
     You're totally insane.
     
               MAVERICK
        (he smiles)
     Thanks very much.
        (he lifts the fish)
     Care for some suchi?.
     
     
     59E.  THE OTHER END OF THE BEACH - LATER
     
     A killer volleyball game in progress. Maverick and Charlie 
     wander toward it, talking softly to themselves. Goose runs up 
     and grabs him away. 
     
               GOOSE
     Come on, we're next.
     
               MAVERICK
     What?
     
               GOOSE
     Come on, I got over six bucks on 
     the line.
     
     Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team, the 
     victors, waiting on the other side of the net for them. Of 
     course it had to be Ice and Slider.Charlie sits and watches 
     as the game gets immediately out of hand. In moments, 
     Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly 
     opposite each other across the net. Other revelers turn to 
     watch as it degenerates (?) to more than a game. Maverick 
     glances at Charlie. He seems uncomfortable, but irrevocably 
     drawn into the confrontation. She says nothing, but her 
     attitude is apparent. Back to the game: Slider and Goose set 
     them up, as they try to spike the ball in each other's face. 
     The final point...up over the middle. They both go up, 
     Maverick smashes, Ice blocks, but the ball sails away, off 
     his forearm. For the first time ever, Maverick beats him. He 
     looks over at Charlie, she is staring out to sea. She looks 
     back at him and he's suddenly had enough competition. They 
     call for another game, but Maverick turns away...
     
               GOOSE
     Come on, come on! It's double or 
     nothing.. We're talking twelve 
     bucks American, here.
     
               MAVERICK
     I've had enough...for now.
     
     He grabs Charlie and his gear..
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Come on.
     
               CHARLIE
     Where?
     
               MAVERICK
     You want to go ballistic?
     
               CHARLIE
     I don't know. I don't like being 
     out of control.
     
     
     He looks back at Ice, bouncing the ball and staring at him.
     
               MAVERICK
     Stick with me, you'll get used to it.

     She looks at his eyes for any sign of a put-on, insincerity.

     moves in and covers his grin with a gentle kiss.

     calculate a number of aircraft's positions and velocities by 
     means of transponders in the ships and ground stations that 
     talk to each other thousands of times a second.  Using this

     of the landscape and height of mountains.
     
     Students and instructors sit on chairs in the peanut 
     gallery, facing Viper at the front of the room. Charlie is in 
     the back.
     
               VIPER
     The bandit has good position right 
     here. All right, freeze here. The 
     moment of choice -- Maverick is 
     defensive. He has a chance to bug 
     out right here....Better to retire 
     and save your plane than force a 
     bad position. Stay in the diamond 
     another three seconds, the bandit 
     will blow you out of the sky...make 
     a hard right, select zone 
     5...(turns to Maverick to drive 
     point home) you can extend and 
     escape. You make a bad choice. Roll 
     forward.
     
     The computerized rendering resumes on the screen.
               VIPER (Con't)
     You perform a split S. That's the 
     last thing you should do. The 
     bandit is right on your tail -- 
     Freeze there...the bandit has you 
     in his gunsight. What were you 
     thinking here, Maverick?
     
               MAVERICK
     I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
     
               VIPER
     Big gamble with a thirty million 
     dollar plane!
     
     
               MAVERICK
         (smiling)
     No guts, no glory.
     
     It's a joke. Viper doesn't like that answer at all, but some 
     of the students laugh and mockingly whistle at the cockiness 
     of it. They give Maverick the high sign. Slider leans forward 
     to him.
               SLIDER
     Your guts. His glory.
     
     Maverick slumps down in his chair under Viper's glare.  The 
     computer rendering rolls forward again. He glances back at 
     Charlie. She smiles sympathetically at him.
     
               VIPER
     Unfortunately, the gamble worked, 
     or you might have learned 
     something. The bandit never gets a 
     clean shot...Maverick makes an 
     aggressive vertical move here, 
     comes over the top and defeats the 
     bandit with a missile shot. The 
     encounter was a victory, but we've 
     shown it as an example of what not 
     to do. Ice is next.
     
     Another computerized rendering comes up on the screen. 
     Hollywood leans close to Maverick and speaks quietly.
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     Gutsiest move I ever saw.
     
     Maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation.
     
               VIPER
     And the dumbest...Okay, look at 
     this. It's textbook. Ice takes 
     control of the battle immediately. 
     He never gives the bandit a chance 
     to take the offensive. An early 
     turn here -- excellent. He goes for 
     the jugular, and it's over just 
     that quick. Let's run that again, 
     it's exactly how it should be done.

     In full flight gear, carrying their helmets and trying to 
     stuff food down their gullets, the students rush/stumble 
     toward the flight line. Hollywood takes a bit of a sandwich 
     and makes a face.
               GOOSE
     What the hell is this?
     
               MAVERICK
     Don't chew it, you won't have it 
     that long. Easier to clean the 
     cockpit if it comes up in big 
     chunks.
     
     Jester yells from the distance.

     They all laugh. Wolfman looks stunned.

     Coogan spent half the night looking 
     for her. He said he was gonna kill 
     the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his 
     sister.

     Nothing. Let's just go fight.
     
     
     Wolfman looks very apprehensive as they approach the F-14's. 
     MECHANICS surround both planes, making last minute checks of 
     all systems. Among them is COOGAN, six and a half feet tall, 
     looking mean. Maverick tosses him a wave.
     
               MAVERICK
     Morning, Coogan.
     
               WOLFMAN
     How's it goin', Coog?

     Hollywood leads, Maverick follows. They point their noses 
     down and dive. Two bogies fly side by side at five thousand, 
     outlined against the blue Pacific. Smaller, slower, they seem 
     helpless for a moment. We hear the instructors in the F-5's.

     Holy shit, it's Viper.
     
               MAVERICK 
     Keep your shirt on, he's saying 
     holy shit it's us.
     
     The bogies split. Bogey One hard left. Bogey Two hard right. 
     Hollywood sweeps left, pursuing Bogey One. Maverick hangs 
     back to cover him.
     
     Bogey One makes a strong vertical move. Hollywood stays on 
     him.
               MAVERICK
     STAY WITH HIM, WOOD... YOUR SIX 
     CLEAR!
     
     Bogey One loops and comes down, and Hollywood almost loses 
     him for a moment before regaining the angle.

     STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!

     returning to the fight. He jerks the stick right, and the two 
     planes make a quick pass.

     Maverick goes suddenly vertical, zooms straight up.
     
               GOOSE
     Hey, come on--hey!
     
     Maverick loops the F-14 down to get the quick angle on Viper 
     in Bogey Two. Viper takes off, running from the fight again. 
     Maverick looks over his shoulder and sees that Hollywood 
     still has a good position on Bogey One. He takes a hard right 
     and streaks off after Viper.
     
               GOOSE
     What what are you doing?

     Viper streaks across the sky with Maverick close behind. He 
     pushes the throttle forward to ZONE 5 - full afterburner.
     Viper shows all his tricks...hard left, hard right, rolling 
     into vertical, flipping into a dive. Maverick stays with him.

     Maverick turns to get Viper in the diamond. He hears a 
     SIDEWINDER GROWL in his headset.
     
               MAVERICK
     What's the range, Goose. I've got a 
     good tone.
     
     Viper jinks but Maverick stays with him.  Viper is in the

     Two bogies ! Three o'clock high,

     They come out of nowhere, flashing down toward Maverick--a 
     crossfire ambush. Maverick's eyes are startled.

     Maverick mopes at the bar, a figure comes up behind him.
     
               VIPER
     Ya know, that was the best flying 
     I've seen since Nam...(He grins) 
     ...Right up to that part where you 
     got killed.
     
     Viper sits down. He's in a jovial, taunting mood.  Maverick 
     watches him guardedly.
     
               VIPER
     Twenty years' experience, I 
     couldn't shake you. You may be a 
     great flyer. I mean that.
     
               MAVERICK
     I lost.
     
               VIPER
     Of course you did. I said a great 
     flyer, not a smart one. You fly 
     reckless. Great instincts. No 
     discipline. That ambush today, you 
     followed your emotions instead of 
     your wingman. Of course you got 
     killed...and well deserved to. It 
     was a really stupid mistake. In 
     battle, it gets people killed.
     
     Maverick nods and stares at his beer.
     
               MAVERICK
     I can take care of myself.
     
               VIPER
     Talent is no holy shield. Von 
     Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. 
     Instincts are not enough. Do it our 
     way. We've worked these things out. 
     The good pilots can become better 
     and the great ones can learn how to 
     stay alive.  (he studies him for a 
     moment)  Why do you have to do 
     everything the hard way?
     
               MAVERICK
     It's my own way. It works for me.  
     I don't care about the rest of that 
     stuff.
     
               VIPER
     Then why are you here?
     
               MAVERICK
     For the same reason you are.
     
               VIPER
     Oh, you mean the thrill!
     
               MAVERICK
     The flying. The fighting.  I'd go 
     up there ten times a day to fight. 
     I'd win at least nine of them. 
     That's all I want to do. It's what 
     I do best. I am real good.  Just 
     give me the jet.
     
     Viper studies him,
     
               VIPER
     It's not a gift, just a loan...
     
     He finishes his beer, then rises.
     
               VIPER
     Nine out of ten is okay, as long as 
     it's only fun and games. But this 
     isn't about that. This is serious 
     business. It is dangerous up there! 
     At 500 knots, things can change a 
     lot in a second. Discipline is what 
     protects us.
     
     He signals the bartender and drops some money on the bar. He 
     stretches, looks around. 
     
               VIPER
     It was a good day. You learned 
     something. You lost and you're 
     still alive to think about it. And, 
     you lost your wingman. That's a 
     cardinal sin...don't ever do it 
     again. You owe Hollywood an apology 
     and you owe me a beer.
     
     Viper touches Maverick's shoulder as he moves away. It was 
     just the gesture Maverick needed, for he seems to relax from 
     his tension. He sips his beer alone.
     
     
     82.  INT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
     
     Maverick and Goose move through the terminal, 
     anxious/expectant looks on their faces.
     
               GOOSE
     Relationships are a bitch, here. 
     It's hard enough to concentrate 
     ...under the pressure. Having a 
     woman here is asking for it.

     I guess that's what I'm doing, 
     then.
     
               GOOSE
     Where do you find the time? Where

     A pretty woman emerges from the crowd and spots them first. 
     She rushes them, happily, carrying her sleepy four-year-old, 
     RICKY. Goose undergoes an immediate change, beaming a big 
     smile that he has practiced on her for years. She sets down 
     the kid.
     
               GOOSE
     ...butt...Hi, honey, God, am I glad 
     to see you! I missed you.
     
     Goose wraps his arms around Carol, smack, a kiss. She smiles 
     at Maverick, turns back to Goose.
     
               CAROL
     I had to come, Willard, I got so 
     lonesome I just couldn't stand it.
     
               GOOSE
     Sure, honey, I understand. It's 
     great to see you. Hey where's your 
     backseater, where's the world's 
     smallest RIO..
     
     He looks all around and then down at the kid, hiding shyly 
     behind his mother's skirts. Goose grabs up the kid and zooms 
     him around, a game they've played before, every six months or 
     so. The kid laughs happily.  Maverick just sort of smiles to 
     himself and shakes his head.

     Maverick comes to the surface. She enters frame by the side 
     of the pool.  She hands him a split fresh pineapple. He eats 
     it in the  most salacious manner possible. He's so contented, 
     he's babbling.

     He gets out, grabs a towel, moves over to some chairs. His 
     flight suit is draped over one. He moves it to sit down.

     His flight suit slips onto the ground. Charlie retrieves it. 
     As she lifts the suit, something falls out of the pocket. 
     Looks like a gold coin. She picks it up. Maverick is drying 
     his hair. She holds the object out to him, questioning. He 
     sees it, quickly takes it, stuffs it back into his pocket.

     Where'd you get it.
     
               MAVERICK
     Pawn shop. What's to eat?
     
     He roots through a picnic basket.
     
     
     84A.  MONTAGE - PREFLIGHT ACTIVITY
     
               VIPER (V.O.) 
     ...MiG sweep over the water.  You 
     will proceed down the one-seven 
     -zero degree radial looking for 
     MiGs. You will engage all that you 
     find, destroy them, and return to 
     base. Maverick, has the lead. Any 
     questions? All right, let's go. 
     Move like you've got a 
     purpose....
     
     85.  EXT. CLOUD COVER - 
     20,000 FT. - DAY
     
     Four F-14's fly in formation over the Pacific, searching for 
     (MiGs). They spot them, engage. The combatants fly scissor 
     patterns, slashing past each other, angling for position.
     
     We hear the VOICES OF COMBAT from the planes, a barrage of 
     information exchanges between pilots and RIO's. Maverick and 
     Ice swoop close together on each other's wing--moving on each 
     other, testing, they glance at each other and nod. The 
     Challenge...the fight is on. Suddenly an F-5 rises up out of 
     the clouds in front of them--Ice has the advantage and rolls 
     in on him.
     
               ICE
     ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
     
               MAVERICK
     SHIT!!
     
     The F-5 sees his pursuers. Goes into a hard left.
     
               ICE
     MIG'S IN A LEFT. MIG'S IN A 
     LEFTHAND. I'M ENGAGING.
     
     
     Ice struggles against the G's to bring his nose to bear. 
     They go around into a Lufbery--a tight circle, Ice has the 
     advantage. He is closer to the F-5's tail than the F-5 is to 
     his. But he can't close, can't line up the shot. He grunts 
     and strains as the G force pushes him down.
     
               MAVERICK
     COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M 
     IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
     
               ICE
     STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M 
     ENGAGED. I'M IN.
     
     Maverick maneuvers close to their left circle.
     
               ICE
     GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. 
     GET OUT OF THERE.
     
               MAVERICK
     FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
     
               ICE
     GET LOST!
     
               MAVERICK
     YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- 
     I'M COMING IN.
     
               ICE
     IT'S MY SHOT.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY 
     WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
     
               ICE
     STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, 
     MAVERICK.
     
               MAVERICK
     YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
     
     
     MAVERICK - ABOVE.
     
               MAVERICK
     ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
     
               ICE
     NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
     
     
     Maverick is pulling a log of G's, but can't target his 
     weapons, he continues to turn in a hard circle, going round 
     and round without gaining. He can't bring his nose to bear.
     
               MAVERICK
     IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
     
               ICE
     NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
     
     Ice stays.
     
               MAVERICK
     COMING IN.
     
     Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 6.5 G's, 
     exposing his underside to Ice. All Ice sees is belly. 
     Obviously, in this attitude Maverick can't see him.
     
               ICE
         (under breath.)
     Sonofabitch.
     
     He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick. 
     Ice quickly rolls up right, in front of him.
     
               ICE
     LOOK OUT!
     
     
     Maverick sees him flash into his view. He has to slam the 
     stick forward to avoid collision. He swings by real close. 
     Too close.
     
               GOOSE
     Oh, no!
     
     
     
     They pass through Ice's turbulence. The blast distorts the 
     airflow to Maverick's left engine. BOOMBOOMBOOM. The engine 
     flames out. Full thrust on the right, engine swings the tail 
     around in a yaw. Maverick slams the stick right to correct 
     but too late.
     
               GOOSE
     Plane's coupling up! Plane's 
     coupling up!
     
     
     The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings 
     around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin, like an 
     out-of -control frisbee.
     
               GOOSE
     This is not good!...(Rising panic) 
     We're low!
     
     
     Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal 
     force, desperately tries to reach back for the ejection 
     lever--but is falling short by about a foot.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm pinned to the panel.
     
               GOOSE
     Time to go.
     
               MAVERICK
     I can't eject.
     
     
     The plane is spinning ever faster, out of control. He drops 
     the gear. Still spins. Goose is closer to center of spin--G 
     forces are less. He reaches behind him for the eject handle, 
     starts the eject sequence.
     
               GOOSE
     3000 feet. I'll do it.
     
               MAVERICK
     Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
     
     
     85A.  BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE
     
     The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the 
     cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet. Goose glances up at 
     it.
     
               GOOSE
     1000.
     
               MAVERICK
     Let's go. Eject.
     
     
     Goose yanks the ejection handle. Things happen in a split 
     second. Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his 
     seat. Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy. A 
     sickening CRUNCH. The canopy is knocked away. Maverick is 
     slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up. 
     He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in.
     
     
     85B.  TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION
     
     He's in shock..the loud THUMPING of his heart, labored 
     breathing, a scream that stays in his mind.
     
     Instinctively, he gropes for straps. He releases the pilot 
     seat, it tumbles away. His chute streams, balloons open, 
     snapping his body like a bullwhip.  He drifts momentarily, 
     then plunges into the sea.
     
     
     85C. UNDERWATER
     
     His face, distorted in the water; wild eyes, disoriented, 
     choking for air. He reaches out, finds nothing to grab.
     Suddenly, he is yanked hard to the side.
     
     
     85D.  SURFACE 
     
     The parachute is caught by the wind, and dragged, pulling 
     Maverick along beneath the surface. He is twisting in the 
     water, turning over and over, trying desperately to slip out 
     of the tangled straps. He finally hits the surface of the 
     water and sucks air into his lungs. With the end of his 
     strength, he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the 
     parachute. It whips away like a kite in a typhoon.
     
     The sea is choppy and rough. He struggles as his equipment 
     drags him under. He twists, finds the inflatable raft 
     attached to his harness. Maverick pulls the cord, and the 
     raft hisses open. He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot 
     raft and collapses, completely exhausted. The survival has 
     been almost without thinking: an instinctual physical 
     struggle.
     
     
     85E.  TWILIGHT
     
     Maverick begins to focus on the situation. He stains the 
     water with dye, then sees another parachute floating nearby. 
     Paddling to the parachute, he reaches over the side and 
     begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the 
     water.
     
     A great struggle. The weight is extremely heavy. Finally, he 
     pulls a body to the surface. Goose. Goose is dead. Maverick 
     releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top 
     of him. He holds Goose in his arms. His mind shuts down 
     again.
     
     From high above the ocean, we see the debris on the water. 
     An oil slick, pieces of honeycomb titanium, and the small, 
     helpless figure in the raft.
     
     DISSOLVE TO:
     
     86.  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT
     
     Searchlights skim over the black ocean. A brilliant light 
     flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare. Helicopter blades 
     flick powerfully. The lights of the choppers descend toward 
     the wreckage area, scanning the debris, searching for life. 
     The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft.
     
     The draft from the chopper churns the water. A FROGMAN drops 
     from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes. He surfaces 
     and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered.
     
     Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose. He 
     hugs Goose closer and looks threatened.
     
     
               FROGMAN
     Let him go, sir. Take it easy.
     
     He tries to pry Goose free, but Maverick has a death grip on 
     the body.
     
               FROGMAN
     Sir! Let him go. It's all right. 
     Let him go.
     
     
     Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water.
     
     Another long moment, then Maverick releases Goose. The 
     frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness. 
     
     HIS POV. - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he 
     is pulled up and away. He shivers from the cold.
     
     
     87.  INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Extreme CLOSE ON Maverick's face. He is emotionless. His 
     eyes are flat and absolutely without expression. There is 
     complete silence in the room. Then we hear the quiet, calm, 
     probing voice of Viper.
     
               VIPER
     How do you feel?
     
               MAVERICK
     All right.
     
               VIPER
     Goose is dead.
     
               MAVERICK
     I know. I was there.
     
     
     
     Not one sign of emotion from Maverick. Not one tone of 
     expression. We see Viper now, and his face is strained from a 
     very long day.
     
               VIPER
     If you fly jets long enough, 
     something like this happens to you. 
     No one escapes it. It touches us 
     all.
     
     Maverick looks at Viper, and his eyes are very disturbed.
     
               MAVERICK
     He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
     
               VIPER
     My first squadron in Vietnam, we 
     lost eight out of eighteen planes. 
     Ten guys. The first one kills you, 
     but there'll be others--you can 
     count on it.
     
     
     No reaction from Maverick. He can't quite face up to that 
     reality right now.
     
               VIPER
     You've got to put him in the box.
     
     
     Maverick is watching Viper, but he doesn't have anything to 
     say.
     
     
     88.  EXT. CHARLIE'S SPORTSCAR - NIGHT
     
     The RADIO plays John Lennon; "Stand by Me". Maverick opens 
     his eyes, doesn't know where he is for a moment.
     
               CHARLIE
     ...they say you're alright.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm fine.
     
               CHARLIE
     This is it, then.
     
               MAVERICK
     What?
     
               CHARLIE
     The dark side. The price you pay 
     for all the fun you're having. You 
     knew about it, of course. Didn't 
     you?
     
               MAVERICK
     He was a friend of mine. A good 
     guy...great guy. It was my 
     fault.
     
               CHARLIE
     That's not what I hear.
     
               MAVERICK
     I was flying...my responsibility.
     
               CHARLIE
     That's what you get flight pay for.
     
               MAVERICK
     Maybe I shouldn't take it.
     
               CHARLIE
         (In surprise)
     Why? You act like you didn't know 
     one day this would happen.
     
               MAVERICK
     Not to me.
     
               CHARLIE
     You knew it. You all do. It's part 
     of it. Maybe the most important 
     part.
     
     
     88A.  ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG 
     
     Charlie's car pulls up. They get out and walk down toward 
     the water. Maverick seems dazed. She is softly taunting.
     
               MAVERICK
     Where are we?
     
               CHARLIE
     Where are we? You know where we 
     are. It's called the beach. It's 
     where life first crawled up out of 
     the sea. I come here sometimes... 
     when I feel like crawling back in.
     
               MAVERICK
     You don't have to do this.
     
               CHARLIE
     Do what, show you a good time?
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm not good company. I should be 
     alone.
     
               CHARLIE
     I don't think so, but if that's 
     what you want...
     
     They stand there, not making a move.
     
               MAVERICK
     No.
     
               CHARLIE
     What do you want?
     
               MAVERICK
     I want it back.
     
               CHARLIE
     What?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yesterday.
     
     She turns, nods out, past the moon.
     
               CHARLIE
     You look way out there. Out past 
     the date line. West becomes East, 
     all things change. You cross the 
     line...today becomes yesterday...or 
     tomorrow, I forget which.
     
               MAVERICK
     That's what I want.
     
               CHARLIE
     Of course the line's just 
     imaginary. You can cross it twenty 
     times...nothing really changes.
     
     She turns and walks along the surfline.
     
               CHARLIE
     On the beach... It's what they say 
     when Navy men retire...He's "On The 
     Beach". I always liked that. I had 
     a picture...in my head... all these 
     old guys wandering around here, 
     looking out into the past.
     
     He walks to the surf, kicks the sand with his bare feet.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     If we knew then, what we know now, 
     we might never have come up out of 
     there.
     
     He turns to her. She just looks at him.
     
               CHARLIE
     You don't believe that.
     
               MAVERICK
     Hardly ever.
     
               CHARLIE
     Only when you're depressed. Then it 
     passes.
     
               MAVERICK
     It does.
     
               CHARLIE
     Everything passes. Immutable law of 
     the Universe.
     
     
     He picks up a piece of flotsam, a twig, worn smooth.
     
               CHARLIE
     This too...shall pass. You put as 
     much life as you can between it and 
     you. You start piling up experience 
     between then and now.
     
     He turns and walks.
     
               MAVERICK
     What do you do when you come here?
     
               CHARLIE
     I sit. I think. I play games.
     
               MAVERICK
     What kind of games?
     
               CHARLIE
     I like to play "reality".
     
     She stops and turns.
     
               MAVERICK
     How do you play reality.
     
               CHARLIE
     It's strip reality, actually, like 
     what the pilots always want to 
     play.
     
               MAVERICK
       (this gets a small laugh)
     Strip reality! How do you play 
     that?
     
               CHARLIE
     It's like strip poker, only, 
     without the bluffing. (he laughs 
     again) One person says something 
     and if the other one accepts that 
     it's true, the one who says it, 
     gets to take one item of clothing 
     off.
     
               MAVERICK
     You're crazy. (She stops, he goes 
     on, softer) That's a pretty silly 
     game.
     
               CHARLIE
     Not as silly as some. You know the 
     silliest one? ...that we are gods. 
     That we control events on the 
     beach... that we can turn back 
     time...
     
     She moves in close.
     
               CHARLIE
     Want to play the game? 
     
               MAVERICK
     How does it go?
     
               CHARLIE
     You say the truth. (a beat...)    
     Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want 
     to win the game, don'tcha?
     
               MAVERICK
     What truth?
     
               CHARLIE
     The big one. The one that's most on 
     your mind.
     
     A long pause...it comes hard.
     
               MAVERICK
     Goose is dead.
     
               CHARLIE
         (she nods)
     True.
     
               MAVERICK
     Now?
     
               CHARLIE
     Take something off.
     
               MAVERICK
     Off me or off you?
     
               CHARLIE
     That's up to you.
     
     
     He takes the ribbon from her hair. It falls down over her 
     face and shoulders. Now it's her turn.
     
               CHARLIE
     It's dangerous...what you do.
     
     He nods. She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around 
     his neck.
     
               MAVERICK
     It was my fault.
     
     
     She says nothing, stands looking into his eyes. He slowly, 
     as if in a trance, takes her blouse off.
     
               CHARLIE
     You can't bring him back.
     
     She takes off his shirt.
     
               MAVERICK
     It was my fault.
     
     
     
     He starts to reach for her. She pulls back.
     
               CHARLIE
     Nope. Already used that.
     
     She turns and thinks for a moment, looking at the moon.
     
               CHARLIE
     Your life goes on.
     
     
     Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head, she grabs it 
     with both hands. She leans in close and bites it. She grabs 
     both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     What does it mean?
     
               CHARLIE
        (shakes her head no)
     That wasn't fair. It was a 
     question. Penalty round!
     
     
     She drops her skirt.
     
               CHARLIE
     You didn't mean it. You didn't 
     think. You'd do anything to take it 
     back.
     
               MAVERICK
     That's three.
     
               CHARLIE
     And that's one!
     
     
     She unbuckles his belt, slowly slides it off. She unzips his 
     pants, they fall.
     
               MAVERICK
     One more.
     
               CHARLIE
     Your watch.
     
     She unbuckles it.
     
               MAVERICK
     You owe me one.
     
     
     He rests his head on her shoulder, unhooks her bra. She 
     shrugs it off.
     
     They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom, looking 
     into each other's eyes.
     
               CHARLIE
     Looks like a tie.
     
               MAVERICK
     Who's gonna win?
     
               CHARLIE
     We'll say it together. On the count 
     of three...One...two...
     
     Leaning in, softer and harder...they both jump the gun.
     
               BOTHTOGETHER
     I love.ove y.you.
     
     They embrace madly and sink to the sand. From the distance 
     it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to 
     the sea.
     
     
     89.  INT. GOOSE'S ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The lights are out in Goose's room at the Bachelor Officers' 
     Quarters. The door opens, and Maverick enters. He sets a 
     cardboard box on the bed.
     
     Silently, Maverick gathers together Goose's few personal 
     possessions. He fills the box with clothes, books, a clock, a 
     radio, a walkman, and articles from the bathroom. He examines 
     each closely, like an artifact...as if he might find some 
     message or meaning in them. He fumbles them into the box. He 
     can't see too well, his eyes are full of tears.
     
     Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door. He takes 
     one last glance around, then leaves and closes the door 
     behind him.
     
     
     89A.  INT. BOQ RECEPTION AREA                      *
     
     Carol and the kid, stand, staring at a silent TV. Carol 
     looks dazed, lost. Maverick walks in, finds her. An awkward 
     silence while they both try to think of something to say. 
     Maverick hands the box to Carol.
     
     90.   OMITTED
     
     89B.  CLOSE UP - MAVERICK.
     
     He sits staring right through us...the thousand-yard stare. 
     A strange white unreal light washes over him. The only color, 
     the Navy and gold of the stripes on his shoulderboards. A low 
     rumbling mumbling filters through the HISS of surf or fans or 
     something...Snatches of low whispered 
     conversation....disregard of...basic air-safety 
     principles...too aggressive...incident.... 29 July...within 
     performance parameters... disciplinary action...tactical 
     doctrine.... even reckless at times... 
     conjecture...unsupported ...benefit of the doubt...
     
     Maverick's 
     eyes slowly focus. The light attenuates. The surrounding 
     image becomes denser. Things become real.
     
     
     89C.  INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MAVERICK'S POV
     
     A BOARD OF INQUIRY, a COMMANDER and other NAVY OFFICERS 
     seated behind tables at the front of the room. Maverick faces 
     them, wearing dress whites. Viper is also present. The 
     Commander looks at each of the Officers. They each nod, in 
     turn, indicating readiness. The Commander turns to Maverick, 
     and states for the record:
     
               CDR.
     The Board of Inquiry finds that Lt. 
     Evan Mitchell was not at fault in 
     the accident of twenty-nine July.
     
     No response from Maverick, one way or the other. Viper 
     studies his face with concern.
     
               CDR.
      Lt. Mitchell's record will be 
     cleared of this incident.
     
     
     Still no response from Maverick.
     
          CDR.
     Lt. Mitchell is restored to flight 
     status without further delay. These 
     proceedings are closed.
     
     Maverick doesn't respond.
     
     
     91.  INT. MAVERICK'S ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Maverick lies on his bunk and stares at the ceiling. The 
     phone next to his bed is RINGING.  It RINGS EIGHT OR NINE 
     TIMES, then stops. He makes no move to reach for it. 
     
     
     92. through 95. OMITTED
     
     
     94A.  INT. COCKPIT - F-14 ON FLIGHT LINE
     
     Maverick sits in the cockpit staring at the controls while 
     the ground crew preps the aircraft for flight. Coogan helps 
     him strap in. He speaks solicitously to Maverick. It is 
     unheard over the JET NOISE and RADIO BABBLE. Maverick looks 
     at the cockpit as if it's a strange territory, suddenly 
     foreign to him. He grabs the stick like it's some peculiar 
     talisman. He turns and looks aft. He seems surprised that it 
     moves the control surfaces in the tails.
     
     96.  INT. F-14 - DAY
     
               FUNGUS
     BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW. YOU'VE 
     GOT THE ANGLE -- PIECE OF CAKE.
     
     
     Maverick checks ten o'clock low. He is disturbed. He tries 
     to make the move, but he is a man with no secret: he is 
     afraid.
     
               FUNGUS
     ENGAGE, MAVERICK - ANYTIME.
     
     
     The bogey abruptly turns into him. Maverick hesitates. Then 
     suddenly, he jerks the stick hard right and takes the F-14 
     away from the bogey at great speed. Fungus is startled.
     
               FUNGUS
     WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN 
     THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
     
          MAVERICK
     DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
     
               FUNGUS
     WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO 
     LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
     
               MAVERICK
     NO. NO GOOD.
     
     
     96A.  INT. FLIGHT LINE - DAY
     
     Jester walks up to Viper who waits near an F-5.
     
               JESTER
     He just won't engage. He can't do 
     it, Skipper. He can't get back on 
     the horse. 
     
               VIPER
     It's only been a week. Keep sending 
     him up.
     
               JESTER
     I've seen this before.
     
               VIPER
     So have I.
     
               JESTER
     Some guys never get it back.
     
     
     He walks off.

     103.  INT. LOCKER ROOM - IMMEDIATELY AFTER 
     
     Maverick grabs his stuff out of the locker, throws them in a 
     bag. He glances up as Fungus enters, continues to pack.
     
               FUNGUS
     What are you doing?
     
               MAVERICK
     Saving them some paperwork.
     
               FUNGUS
     Since when did you care about  
     paperwork? 
     
     Maverick walks away. Fungus hesitates, then follows him.
     
               FUNGUS
     If I could fly like you I'd have 
     everything I want. If I could fly 
     at all. I can't fly. I can't fly 
     like that. Nobody can. Whatever it 
     is, you've got it!
     
               MAVERICK
     Not anymore. 
     
               FUNGUS
     So, you're scared--so what? You 
     ever get a good look at me in the 
     back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
     
     Grabbing the suitcase, Maverick brushes past Jester and 
     walks up the corridor. Jester and Fungus watch him go. Fungus 
     goes to the phone.
     
     
     104.  EXT. SAN DIEGO AIRPORT - NIGHT
     
     Charlie parks her car, jumps out, and runs toward the main 
     entrance to the terminal.
     
     
     105.  INT. TERMINAL
     
     Charlie hurries through the crowd, bumping past people, 
     searching frantically for Maverick in the huge terminal. She 
     moves past bench after bench, and her eyes flick in all 
     directions. A quick glance at the souvenir shop, the coffee 
     shop, and then she heads for the bar.
     
     Maverick is there, sitting alone in a booth with his 
     suitcase beside him, staring into a drink. Charlie composes 
     herself, then walks to the booth and sits down across the 
     table from him. Maverick does not look pleased.
     
               CHARLIE
     Never liked fighter pilots anyway. 
     
     
     
     He looks up trying to be angry, but he can't help it, she 
     makes him laugh.
     
               MAVERICK
     You came to the right place.
     
     The waitress comes up.
     
               MAVERICKWhat are you having?
     
     Turns to the waitress.
     
               CHARLIE
     I'll have what he's having... 
     Hemlock, is it?
     
     The waitress departs. He tries not to smile, but can't help 
     it.
     
               CHARLIE
     You weren't gonna say goodbye?
     
               MAVERICK
     I was, later. 
     
               CHARLIE
     Long distance? I wouldn't do that 
     to you. I'd at least talk to you.
     
               MAVERICK
     I didn't want to see you. I mean, I 
     did...but I didn't..
     
               CHARLIE
     I know exactly what you mean.
     
               MAVERICK
     How could you?
     
          CHARLIE
     I've got a gift just like you do. 
     My gift is I just know what people 
     mean, even if they can't say it. It 
     helps when you're trying to 
     communicate with fighter pilots. 
     Like what you just said was "I'm 
     embarrassed, I feel I've done 
     something wrong, that I've failed, 
     and I don't think I can live up to 
     the expectations of a wonderful 
     interesting, intelligent woman like 
     yourself." That about it?
     
               MAVERICK
         (laughs)
     ...Something like that.
     
     
               CHARLIE
     And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by 
     myself for awhile, like until I can 
     think of a new career...hotel 
     management or something...
     
               MAVERICK
     Big talk for someone who's never 
     been shot off her computer.
     
               CHARLIE
     Hey, I never said I was a fighter 
     pilot...I never claimed to think it 
     was fun to be shot off the end of a 
     ship in a storm. I can find 
     contentment in a good book. I don't 
     have to roar by someone at Mach two 
     with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I 
     just get happy being with the right 
     man.
     
               MAVERICK
     I hope you find him.
     
               CHARLIE
     I think I have... I could be wrong. 
     I have been before. Just remember 
     one thing. If you're not Top Gun, 
     if you're not fighting jets, you're 
     not gonna be able to act like a 
     fighter pilot... You're gonna have 
     to act like the rest of us. You're 
     gonna have to master humility. For 
     you guys, that's the toughest 
     maneuver of all.
     
     She gets up...lays a bill out for the drinks...
     
               CHARLIE
     So long, Sailor. See you on the 
     beach sometime.
     
     
     She swings away. Her wake sucks in the stares of every man 
     in the place. Then they look over to Maverick, quick flicks 
     of envy in their eyes. He stares them back and can't quite 
     meet their eyes.
     
     
     106.  EXT. BEACH AT VIPER'S HOUSE - LATER
     
     Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid. They 
     come across one creature who's had a bad night...Viper spots 
     him, he spots Viper, and Viper moves toward him. Tim, Viper's 
     kid, wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that 
     direction. He stops, puts his hand on his hips like he's seen 
     the pilots do. 
     
               TIM
     Dad...Of all the aminals in the 
     ocean, which one's the baddest?
     
     
               VIPER
     I don't know, Tim. You'll have to 
     ask them.
     
     Viper turns to the creature, Maverick, and shrugs.
     
               VIPER
     Runs in the family...
     
     Maverick stands up. 
     
               MAVERICK
     Skipper, sorry to bother you.
     
               VIPER
     No bother.
     
               MAVERICK
     I called your house.
     
               VIPER
     My wife's house.
     
               MAVERICK
     She said you took your kid to the  
     each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or 
     beach or the ballgame. Y'have the 
     option...(Maverick thinks for a 
     beat. Segues to the question...) 
     What about me?
     
     Viper turns, they stroll together.
     
               VIPER
     We can send you back to your 
     squadron with nothing noted on your 
     record except "CNC" --course not 
     completed, no explanation required. 
     Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your 
     career, but people always wonder 
     about things like that.
     
               MAVERICK
     Or....
     
               VIPER
     Or you can quit.
     
               MAVERICK
          I don't know...
      
               VIPER
     I didn't know either. That's why I 
     told Jester to prepare your papers.
     
     Maverick looks irritated. Viper stops at an icecream vendor 
     and orders three with a gesture.
     
               MAVERICK
     You've already made up your mind.
     
     
               VIPER
     It's no disgrace, kid. That spin 
     was hell. It would wreck anyone's 
     confidence. You could be a good 
     pilot again someday...
     
               MAVERICK
         (starts to get his back up)
     You think I should quit?!
     
               VIPER
     I didn't say that. That's up to 
     you. But I have responsibility for 
     the other guys up there, not just 
     you. They need to know you're all 
     right...that they can depend on 
     you.
     
     
     The vendor hands them icecream, they take it.
     
               MAVERICK
     Here, let me get this. We'll be 
     even.
     
     He reaches into his pocket for change, comes out with a 
     handful. Slams it on the counter, stars picking the proper 
     change out. Viper spots something and reaches for 
     it...Maverick sees and tries to block it, but Viper comes up 
     with the Navy Cross.
     
               MAVERICK
     Lucky charm.
     
     But Viper recognizes it for what it is.
     
               VIPER
     Sometimes it's luck, but in this 
     case, he earned it... I served with 
     your old man.
     
               MAVERICK
     I know.
     
               VIPER
     VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me 
     of him. You're just like he was, 
     only better...and worse.
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm nothing like him.
     
               VIPER
     You may not think so, but you are.
     
               MAVERICK
     He was by the book, all the way.
     
               VIPER
     They waved him off. He thought he 
     knew better. He hit the 
     ramp.
     
               MAVERICK
     I never heard that.
     
               VIPER
     Not something they tell dependents.
     
               MAVERICK
     It's not true.
     
     
     Viper looks at him, for a long beat, throws his icecream 
     away.
     
               VIPER
     Why would I lie?
     
     He turns, walks away. Maverick stands there for a moment, 
     thinking, then catches up to him, stops him...struggles with 
     the thought...as Viper breaks in...
                 
               VIPER
     You start on a wrong heading... the 
     more you stick to it, the further 
     you get from your target. A good 
     pilot always questions himself, 
     always questions his judgments, 
     stays alert for drift and makes the 
     corrections...You may find a little 
     discipline helps with the fear. You 
     don't have to be alone up there.
     
     A pause...quiet intensity.
     
               MAVERICK
     How can I go on? I feel so... 
     responsible.
     
               VIPER
     Kid, the plain fact is...you are. 
     I'm not gonna stand here and blow 
     sunshine up your ass. Technically, 
     they absolved you. You and I know 
     what really happened. You pushed 
     it. You are responsible and you'll 
     always carry that. You know what, 
     I'll carry it too. I should have 
     taken you out of that cockpit.
     I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... 
     I always try to find something 
     worthwhile in someone's death. It's 
     no trade-off. It's not one for one. 
     What you learned isn't worth his 
     death. It couldn't be. But maybe 
     there is some value in it. I know 
     it's the first thing I've ever seen 
     that's really gotten to you. Now 
     the question is, what will you do 
     with it. If it gets you out of 
     flight status...so you don't kill 
     yourself or anybody else...that's 
     good. That's one good thing. You 
     were an accident waiting to 
     happen.
     
               MAVERICK
     You think I shouldn't fly.
     
               VIPER
     I didn't say that. That's up to 
     you. I think that if you do, if you 
     choose to come back, you'll be a 
     better pilot... a better man.
     
               MAVERICK
     Would you take me back? Would they?
     
               VIPER
     I'll have to think about it. I 
     don't know about them. I do know 
     one thing, We've got a lot invested 
     in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even 
     more than those other guys, Naval 
     Aviation needs a very few, very 
     good men.

     115.  INT. TOP GUN OFFICE  
     
     LOUD ROCK AND ROLL. The graduation ceremonies are in full 
     swing...They consist of informal ribbing, laughing, and a lot 
     of talking with the hands. every now and then, the name Goose 
     comes up and a shadow passes across a face. For the most 
     part, they press on, having a good time. Fungus shrugs at 
     someone's question and looks around.
     
               FUNGUS
     I don't know where he is...
     
               PORK
     What are his plans?
     
               FUNGUS
     I don't know.
     
     Ice stands proudly holding the Top Gun plaque as others 
     congratulate him...Hollywood looks up as the door opens, 
     Maverick is there.  He looks uncomfortable, unsure. He sees 
     Ice with the plaque. Fungus moves over to him, brings him in.
               FUNGUS
     I'm glad.
     
               WOLFMAN
     Good to see you, man.
     
     One by one, they come over, shake his hand. Viper stands 
     there, looking pleased but gruff. Maverick walks over, shakes 
     his hand. The party starts to pick up. A real celebration, 
     now. 
     
     Jester enters, a sheaf of messages in his hand. He takes 
     Viper aside for a word. Viper nods at him. The group's 
     attention gradually swings onto them. They quiet down 
     instinctively. Viper finally turns to them.
     
               VIPER
     Gentlemen, you know how I hate to 
     break up this party before it has a 
     chance to get really out of hand...
         (more serious)
     ...but there's a major flap on.

     You're on your way. Don't bother 
     going to BOQ. Your bags are packed.
     
     He hands them orders. Someone turns the music back up... as 
     they shake hands all around, the music grows, becomes purer 
     as the background voices drop out.

     To include his helmet. Stereo headphones from his walkman 
     carry the same music from the party as he sits in the cockpit 
     and stares at the grey water rushing under. He sits in his 
     Tomcat on Ready 5 Alert. In the back, Fungus plays a hand 
     computer game - Jet Attack.

     He goes over the briefing in his mind...Stinger's voice 
     breaks through the music.:

     RIO's pay close attention to the Squadron CO, Stinger.
     
               STINGER
     ...by unknown forces...by Migs. We 
     don't know who they are.  All I 
     know is that it's our ship, and our 
     orders are to escort it out of the 
     area.
     
     Stinger circles an area on the map.

     He studies his copy of the same map, headings and vectors 
     pencilled in.
     
               STINGER (V.O.) 
     This is "Bullseye". A rescue 
     operation is to begin within the 
     hour. Your mission is to give air 
     support to that rescue. There are 
     MiGs in the area, and tensions are 
     high. If you witness a hostile act 
     you will return fire. We will be 
     covering 360 degrees of the compass 
     by section. Be prepared for 
     anything.

     on Ready Five.

     Maverick sits in his Tomcat on the Catapult on ready alert, 
     listening to the message traffic. He gets a launch order, 
     turns to the LSO. The LSO salutes, Maverick salutes and flips 
     him the bird. The LSO drops to the deck. Maverick is slammed 
     back as the F-14 is fired off the deck and rockets into the 
     sky.

     The two MiGs cross in a scissor pattern in their path... a  
     provocation...they join together again and fly level at ten 
     thousand feet. One of the MiGs does a sudden canopy roll.

     VERY FANCY!

     disappears into the clouds.

     122A.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
     
               FUNGUS
     Let's go! Dive on those bastards!  
     
     Maverick hesitates.
     
               FUNGUS
     Come on, man, engage. This is it. 
     Get your nose in there.
     
     Maverick hesitates again. He sees the hornet's nest below; 
     planes all over the sky.
     
               FUNGUS
     Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. 
     Take him. Pull on the goddamn 
     stick, man!
     
               MAVERICK
     Okay, okay.
     
               FUNGUS
     Don't tell me okay. Do it!
     
     Maverick draws a breath, then forces himself to pull the 
     stick over. The F-14 rolls in hard toward the battle. 
     Suddenly, the cluster breaks apart. The MiGs break in every 
     direction as Maverick BLASTS through their formation. 
     Something comes up through the clouds. A MiG BLASTS by. 
     Another rolls in and locks onto them.
     
     The MiGs swarm toward the TOMCATS, coming from every 
     direction. CANNON FIRE erupts from one of the MiGs.
     
               MAVERICK
     MAVERICK'S EMGAGED. HARD LEFT, ICE, 
     PADLOCK THE EASTERN SECTION.
     
     The F-14's execute a left oblique turn in unison. They come 
     down in a section attack with their cannons blazing. From 
     Maverick's cockpit, everything looks choppy:  MiGs slide past 
     at incredible speed. Cannons BLAST, as the planes scramble 
     for position.
     
     Out-numbered four to two, Maverick and Ice fight 
     defensively. Maverick has the angle on a MIG, when Fungus 
     spots a missile launch.
     
               FUNGUS
     BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! 
     FLARES!
     
               MAVERICK
     BREAKING LEFT!
     
     Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard 
     left. The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out 
     of the area, missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea.
     
               ICE
     TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL, MAVERICK. I'M 
     DEFENSIVE.
     
     Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice. He 
     cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE, driving it down 
     toward the deck. Ice goes into vertical and comes around to 
     gain an angle on the other MiG. His RIO is in position to 
     check Mav's rear. 
     
               SLIDER
     MAVERICK! SIX O'CLOCK!
     
     Maverick turns to look and jerks a hard left. The MiG is on 
     him, CANNON BLAZING. Ice Yo Yos inside and cuts the MiG off. 
               ICE
     FOX ONE.
     
     He fires a sidewinder. The MiG turns hard, the missile sails 
     away.
     
     
               SLIDER
     BANDIT, THREE O'OLOCK HIGH!
     
     Ice's F-14 is suddenly caught in a HAIL OF CANNON FIRE as a 
     MiG sweeps down from three o'clock. He breaks, dives. The 
     jets streak across the sky, low to the deck, skimming the 
     surface.
     
               FUNGUS
     ICE'S  DEFENSIVE, HELP HIM OUT.
     
     Maverick's F-14 Rollaways in and intercepts the bogey on 
     Ice's tail.
     
               MAVERICK
     REVERSE RIGHT.
     
     Ice turns right, the MiG bugs and jerks into vertical.  
     Maverick swoops after him.
     
               FUNGUS
     STAY WITH HIM. YOUR SIX IS CLEAR.
     
     
     Maverick closes, jerking left, right, twisting and turning, 
     staying on his tail. 
     
     
     122B.  MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
     
               FUNGUS
     ONE ON OUR SIX! BUG OUT! BUG OUT!
     
     BULLETS fly by Maverick's F-14 from the MiG on his six. He 
     pulls a hard left, then takes the plane straight up. We hear 
     instructions shouted by Fungus, but it is all obscured in the 
     SOUNDS AND FURY OF THE BATTLE. Maverick peels over the top 
     and comes down like a comet. A series of passes at the MiGs. 
     As they come by, one of the MiGs pulls up, 
     
               MAVERICK
     OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH. 
     
               ICE
     LOOK OUT! 
     
     
     They look up. An MiG 21 is coming down, belly to them, close 
     to a mid-air collision.
     
               MAVERICK
     JESUS!
     
     
     He pushes down. The MiG ROARS BY. The whole airplane goes 
     "BOOOMMMM" it's that close.
     
               FUNGUS
     OHHHHH SHIT!
     
     The shock, the air pressure SLAMS them as it goes by, 
     missing by 4-5 feet. Maverick pulls back in, sees a MiG 21 
     below. It takes off, bugging out. Ice goes after him. The MiG 
     maneuvers, jerking hard left, hard right, twisting  up, down.
     
     Ice is right in his shadow. They come in hard and low over 
     the sea. He has the MiG in the diamond.
     
               ICE
     GOOD TONE, FOX ONE
     
     The MiG starts turning.
     
               ICE
     Ah Nuts!
     
     
     The missile goes by the tail.
     
               ICE
     Son of a bitch!
     
     Then his tail comes off, the airplane goes over, a chute 
     comes out. The MiG EXPLODES into a thousand small pieces. 
     They roar by the MiG pilot hanging in his straps.
     
               SLIDER
     JESUS!  HEY SPLASH ONE, SPLASH ONE 
     BANDIT! SPLASH THAT SUCKER!
     
               MAVERICK
     I GOT ONE HERE. ON THE NOSE.  
     COMING DOWN. 
     
     Rolling down on him, good SIDEWINDER TONE. The MiG'S sense 
     him, they break, one guy down low. 
     
               ICE
     ON THE NOSE?
     
               MAVERICK
     GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
      
     He squeezes the trigger.
     
     
     123.  EXT. THE MISSILE STARTS TO GO 
     
     The vapor trail comes off, the MiG 21 turns like he's been 
     bounced off a rubber wall, comes around on the missile, beats 
     it. The missile flies by him. 
     
     
               MAVERICK
     AH, SHIT! GODDAMN IT!
     
     MiG comes back turning into him.
     
               FUNGUS
     THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
     
               MAVERICK
     I GOT ONE COMING UP.
     
               FUNGUS
     AND HE'S GUNNING.
     
     He looks back. 30 millimeter tracers go by; they just kind 
     of float. He breaks, hits airbrakes, the trailing MiG dives 
     through.
     
     Suddenly another MiG appears, rocketing straight for him. 
     They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM!--They pass nose to nose, 
     canopy to canopy. Both planes pitch straight up, trying for 
     the altitude advantage.
     
               MAVERICK
     Zone 5 burners.
     
     The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail, full 
     thruster, it rockets straight up, away from the planet.  
     Maverick has the advantage. Suddenly, his F-14 runs out of 
     energy. FUNGUS is the first to call it.
     
               FUNGUS
     We're ballistic! Ohhhhhh Shit!
     
     The plane backs down on itself, backs into its own smoke as 
     it flips over, falls away...He catches it, just regains 
     control, when...A ROAR. He looks up.
     
     SECOND MIG coming down. Right on him. It fills the Canopy! 
     Instinctive - A Push to miss him, Maverick breaks fast down 
     into him, a last ditch maneuver, and the airplane 
     DEPARTS...the roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it 
     tumbles over the top; the airplane just goes end-over-end. 
     They are being slammed and rattled all over the 
     cockpits...bone-jarring, neck-snapping whips. SHRIEKS and 
     SCREAMS from the airframe. Terriflying?
     
               FUNGUS
     Ohhh Mother!
     
               MAVERICK
         (strangely calm)
     Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a 
     slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, 
     I've got it.
     
     
     Fungus is getting his teeth rattled. He's helpless, he has 
     no controls, there's nothing he can do but hold on.
     
     
               FUNGUS
     Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? 
     Are you CRAZY?
     
               MAVERICK
     Roger, I've got it. 
     
     The plane's gyrations are rattling Fungus's helmet off the 
     canopy. 
     
               FUNGUS
     You've got it?   Good!  Cause for a 
     minute there, you had me worried.
     
     It yaws and rolls, starts into a spin.
     
               FUNGUS
     Now have you got it?  Have you 
     still got it?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yawing right.
     
               FUNGUS
     I know!
     
               MAVERICK
     Rudder's left, stick's forward.
     
               FUNGUS
     Swell! Passing ten thousand!
     
     
               MAVERICK
     I've got it -- hold on!
     
               FUNGUS
     Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your 
     harness!
     
               MAVERICK
     I can recover. Hold on!
     
     They're in a progressive spiral, nose low.  The altimeter 
     unwinds, speed picks up. The G forces are forcing them away 
     from the axis of spin, jamming Maverick against the 
     instrument panel at the front of the cockpit. 
     
               MAVERICK
     You with me?
     
     Fungus, also, is jammed to his panel.
     
               FUNGUS
     Right behind you. 
     
     He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held. 
     It doesn't do much good, however, he can't control the plane. 
     The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop; the 
     ejection handle. He reaches for it.
     
               FUNGUS
     Speed's up to 150. 
     
     Fungus's eyes are wide.  The earth grows larger as it rises 
     towards them. G forces flatten them. They've long since lost 
     the MiG. Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this 
     maneuver.
     
               FUNGUS
     5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
     
               MAVERICK
     Okay.
     
     
     The earth grows larger.
     
               FUNGUS
     4500. Critical point.
     
     
     FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands.
     
               MAVERICK
     No! Not again!
     
               FUNGUS
     What are you talking about,
          we gotta go!
     
               MAVERICK
     I'm not losing it again!
     
     The jet is standing on its nose, gaining speed, plunging 
     towards the ocean.  
     
               FUNGUS
     Gotta go, man.
     
               MAVERICK
     280, 290, 300 knots.
     
               FUNGUS
     3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man.  
     3,000 feet, we gotta go!
     
               MAVERICK
     You go. I'm staying with it.
     
               FUNGUS
     I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
     
     Then, just as suddenly, as he's about to pull...Maverick 
     catches it. The plane responds. They're out of the spin. He 
     gets control. Fungus sits there dumbly, hands on handle. 
     Still not believing...
     
               FUNGUS
     ONE....ONE....ONE...
     
     
     SEA LEVEL 
     
     Maverick stops the tumble, pulls the nose up quickly and the 
     F-l4 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet 
     above the deck. He comes up and looks right at Ice. Ice is 
     down low. He comes around, a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap 
     suit. A flick, a whip, and Maverick in perfect position, 
     rolls right in on the MiG. Fungus looks like he just saw 
     Jesus. 
     
               FUNGUS
     What  in  the  Christ...was that? 
     
     He looks at the Mig target set-up in front of him in awe.
     
               FUNGUS
     Did you plan that? Was all that 
     something you planned?
     
     
     Maverick's acquired the target and is all business. 
     
               MAVERICK
     ALL RIGHT, ICE. COME HARD 
     STARBOARD, THEN EXTEND TO THE EAST. 
     
     
     Fungus is still lividly frazzled.
     
               FUNGUS
     Because...if that was... Next time 
     you tell me first.
     
               ICE
     ROG.
     
     Maverick breaks down, Ice zooms up, breaks in and takes the 
     MiG the other way. Maverick Yo Yo's in, comes right up behind 
     the MiG, as the MiG starts acceleration. 
     
     
     Maverick rolls in on Ice and the MiG. 
     
               MAVERICK
     I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD 
     TONE ON IT.
     
               ICE
     I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF  
     A SHOT?
     
               MAVERICK
     I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
     
               ICE
     WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
     
               MAVERICK
     WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2 
     
     The MiG fires.
     
               MAVERICK
     HE FIRED, BREAK NOW!
     
     Ice breaks left, drops flares. The MiG's missile follows the 
     flares. Maverick FIRES. The missile doesn't twitch. It flys 
     right up the tail pipe of the MiG, the canopy flies off, the 
     pilot comes out of it, and then the MiG blows up, We go right 
     through the fire ball. VVVARRRUOOMMM!
     
               MAVERICK
     He's out! We got him!
     
     The MiG rolls into the ground...KABOOM!  They swoop by the 
     pilot, hanging in his straps...He watches them, dumbly. 
     Fungus waves. 
     
               FUNGUS
     What a dope! Maybe they'll
          give him another plane...and we
          can shoot him down again.
     
     Maverick and Ice join up, light it, stand on their burners 
     and blast straight for the sun.
     
     
     MAVERICK'S F-14 
     
     Without warning, a triple roll, as the elation hits him.
     
     
     125.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT 
     
               FUNGUS
     What is it? What's wrong?
     
     
     Fungus nervously looks around at his circuit breakers.
     
               FUNGUS
     Is there something I should know?
     
               MAVERICK
     Just relax.
     
               FUNGUS
     Is it the plane?
     
               MAVERICK
     The plane is fine.
     
               FUNGUS
     Is it you?
     
               MAVERICK
     Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We 
     did it...Damn! We sure did it!
     
               MAVERICK
     HELLO MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK. 
     I'VE GOT A MESSAGE FOR STINGER. 
     
               STRIKE 
     (V.O.) 
     ROGER, MAVERICK. GO AHEAD.
     
               MAVERICK
     TELL STINGER MAVERICK HAS GOOD NEWS 
     AND SOME BAD NEWS. THE GOOD NEWS IS 
     THAT ICE GOT A MIG. THE BAD NEWS IS 
     THAT MAVERICK GOT TWO!
     
     He looks over at Ice.  
     
               MAVERICK
     I GOTTA HAVE ONE.
     
     
     126.  INT. ICE'S COCKPIT
     
               SLIDER
     We're low on fuel, Ice.
     
     Ice considers for a moment, then responds.
     
               ICE
     I know. I know....Aw hell, let's do 
     it!
     
     
     127.  INT. MAVERICK'S COCKPIT
     
               FUNGUS
     You're not supposed to...
     
               MAVERICK
     But I have to!
     
               FUNGUS
     Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right 
     behind you.
     
               MAVERICK
     MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST 
     A FLYBY.
     
     
     128.  PRI-FLY BRIDGE - (Primary Flight Control)  USS KITTY 
     HAWK
     
     The Air Boss speaks to Maverick over the UHF. The Admiral, 
     the XO and other officers watch and listen.
     
               AIR BOSS
     NEGATIVE, GHOST RIDER, THE 
     PATTERN'S FULL.
     
               MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
     MUSTANG, THIS IS GHOST RIDER. 
     REQUEST A FLYBY FOR TWO.
     
               OFFICER
     Who is that guy?
     
     
               ADMIRAL
     Mitchell...
     
               XO
        (surpressing a grin)
     ...Likes to break at 600, 'stead of 
     300 knots. The Air Boss hates him. 
     One time, he came over the deck at 
     two hundred, shakes the shit out of 
     the bridge. Lifted Johnson right 
     off his feet.
     
     
     129.  INT. MAVERICK'S F-14
     
     He glances over at Ice, who gives him thumbs up.
     
               MAVERICK
     BOSS, YOU BETTER CLEAR IT OUT,
          WE'RE FIVE MINUTES OUT
          AND WE'RE DOING IT!
     
     
     130.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE
     
     The Admiral looks out over the water and smiles.
     
               MAVERICK (V.O. filtered)
     TEN MILES ASTERN, BOSS. HOW ABOUT 
     IT?
     
     
     The Air Boss is livid. He clenches the mike.
     
               AIR BOSS
     MUSTANG TO GHOST RIDER!...
     
     Just then the Admiral pipes up.
     
               ADMIRAL
     Johnson!
     
               AIR BOSS
     Yes, Sir, Admiral?
     
               ADMIRAL
     Give him his flyby.
     
     
     The Admiral looks at the others, tries to surpress his own 
     grin. He slides into his (borrowed) command chair, looks into 
     the wind. On the back of the chair, a clue; his name and 
     rank:  RADM. Buford Clancy, "BOOMER"
     
     The AIR BOSS burns, but has no choice. 
     
               AIR BOSS
         (really pissed off)
      ROGER, GHOST RIDER, YOU'RE CLEAR.
     
     131.  EXT. 
     KITTY HAWK DAY
     
     Sailors line the deck and search the sky. They crane their 
     necks from their battle stations, sweating into the sun, 
     watching for the approach of F-14's. Someone sees it--he 
     points and SHOUTS. The F-14 appears, and every man stands and 
     CHEERS.
     
     
     132. POV -
     
     WE COME SCREAMING IN, 5 FEET OVER THE WATER, throwing up 
     rooster tails behind. WE SPLIT OFF and ZOOM along each side 
     of the carrier, at 100 feet and ROLL IT.
     
     
     133.  INT. PRI-FLY BRIDGE--VVVAAAAABBOOOOM!
     
     It lifts the Air Boss right off his feet. The walls warp, 
     dust sifts from the overhead. The whole tower just goes BOOM!
     
               AIR BOSS
     Goddamn that guy!"
     
     
     134.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
     
     They break at 500 knots. Ice is first down over the ramp, 
     waved in.  The F-14 comes in a little rocky. It bounces hard 
     but grabs the wire, then jerks to a sudden halt. The sailors 
     CHEER AND APPLAUD, throwing fists of victory into the air, 
     straining to get a look at Ice as the crew directs his plane 
     off to the side. Opening the canopy, Ice and Slider unstrap. 
     Stinger and the others are there. Guys are climbing up, 
     climbing all over the airplane. They're already painting a 
     MiG on the side, and they're looking at Ice in awe.
     
     
     135.  POV - MAVERICK - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - AS HE LANDS
     
     He catches the wire, the view slams down toward the deck as 
     the plane arrests, then comes up...He releases the cockpit 
     and can hear the ROAR OF THE CROWD...
     
     
     136.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
     
     He swings the nose around past Ice's. Ice's plane is covered 
     in colored jerseys as the ground crew pulls him out. 
     Maverick's plane swings towards the PRI-FLY BRIDGE. Pilots in 
     flightsuits pour from the deck hatch APPLAUDING... 
     
     
     137.  HE CUTS HIS ENGINES AS THE GROUND CREW SWARMS
     
     As Maverick and Fungus climb down, they see their wingmen on 
     the deck. Ice is looking in Maverick's direction. His face is 
     inscrutable. Maverick gets mobbed, but pushes over to Ice. 
     They stare at each other for a moment, eye to eye even as 
     they are buffeted by the crowd. Finally, Ice breaks...a grin.
     
     
               ICE
     I guess I owe you one.
     
               MAVERICK
     You don't owe me anything.
          We're on the same team. 
     
               ICE
     You saved our lives. You did it! 
     
               MAVERICK
     We did it.
     
               ICE
     You're a hell of a flyer.
              (he can't resist)
          You can be my wingman any time.
     
               MAVERICK
         (laughs)
     No. You can be mine!
     
     Now Ice laughs. Nobody's ever gonna win on this one. But Ice 
     smiles at him...It's now a running joke between them.
     
               ICE
     Whatever you say, Commander.
     
     
     He and Slider snap to and proudly salute. Maverick 
     hesitates, then returns it. As Ice and Slider snap it off, it 
     turns into the pilot's salute, they give them the bird. 
     Maverick and Fungus laugh and return the compliment. 
     
     As they are mobbed by sailors, Maverick is elated to see two 
     familiar figures: Hollywood and Wolfman turn from their 
     battle damaged TOMCAT on the forward elevator as it sinks out 
     of sight below decks.
     
     
     138.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK
     
               FUNGUS
     What happened to you?
     
               WOLFMAN
     He got our radio, and an engine. We 
     were lucky to make it back.
     
               HOLLYWOOD
     Not luck. Skill.
     
     
     ANOTHER ANGLE
     
     Stinger rushes up, grabs Ice and Maverick in a bear hug.
     
               STINGER
     MiG killers! You name it, boy. 
     Sky's the limit. You name it. A 
     medal. Anything you want. Anything.
     
     
               ICE
     MiG killers!  What else is there?
     
     Maverick grins, turns away from them.  He he looks out, at 
     the dying sun glinting over the sea. He thinks how beautiful 
     it is out here! Fungus grabs him from behind.
     
               FUNGUS
     You hear that? Anything we want. 
     Anything...Well???
     
               MAVERICK
     Well what?
     
               FUNGUS
     What do you want?
     
               MAVERICK
     What do I want?
     
               FUNGUS
     What do you want?
     
               MAVERICK
          (he thinks.)
     Any more MiGs?
     
     Stinger shakes his head no.
     
               STINGER
     They don't seem to want to come up 
     anymore. There's nothing on the 
     scopes. In fact, everybody's 
     denying the incident ever happened. 
     So...what is it?  What do you want?
     
     
     Maverick turns away, considering the options.
     
     
     139.  EXT. FLIGHT DECK - ANOTHER ANGLE
     
     Another Tomcat rolls up to park nearby. He looks 
     at the plane. Over the deck LOUDSPEAKER, comes the 
     final call to the F-14:
     
               LSO (V.O. filtered)
         (a touch of sarcasm)
     OKAY, GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN CUT YOUR 
     ENGINES...YOU HAVE ARRIVED....
     
     
     WWHHHEEEEZZZZEEERRRRRUUUUUMMMMMMMMM...
     
     AS THE ENGINES FADE, SO DOES THE PICTURE.
     
     
     FADE IN - WEEKS LATER
     
     140.  EXT. DAY - FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - TOPGUN
     
     Viper, Jester and others walk out of hangar to watch a wing 
     return.
     
     
     141A.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY
     
     THEIR POV. Suddenly an F-14 breaks, ROARS in over the field 
     inverted, a hundred feet off the ground.
     
     
     142.  FLIGHT LINE MIRAMAR - DAY
     
               JESTER
     Who's the hell is that?
     
               VIPER
     Three guesses.
     
               JESTER
     Well, he's in trouble and he didn't 
     even get here yet.
     
     
     Jester looks over at an admiral, who steps out of a staff 
     car, squints up at the swooping plane, turns, barks an order 
     to his driver, jumps in the car and SLAMS the door, the car 
     takes off.
     
     
     143.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - FURTHER DOWN THE RUNWAY
     
     MP jeeps - lights flashing, pull out and head for the flight 
     line.
     
               VIPER
     Come on.
     
     They head for the hangar
     
     
     144.  OVER THE END OF THE RUNWAY
     
     The jet breaks at 500 knots and sets down neatly on the 
     tarmac. The rest of his flight follows in perfect formation.
     
     
     145.  EXT. MIRAMAR RUNWAY - DAY - MAVERICK'S JET -PULLING UP
     
     He unbuckles his straps, takes his helmet off. He looks over 
     at the approaching caravan.
     
               FUNGUS
     I think they know we're here.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Let me do the talking.
     
               FUNGUS
     Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do 
     the talking! 
     
     He stands up in the cockpit, gives a snappy salute.
     
               FUNGUS
     Why Admiral....How really good it 
     is to see you!
     
     
     Maverick turns away. As he backs down the steps, a jeep 
     screeches up, doors slam open, footsteps.
     
               A VOICE
     Who's in charge here?
     
               MAVERICK
     I am.
     
     He's answered automatically, but now it hits him. He knows 
     the voice. He turns.
     
     HIS POV - CHARLIE, HANDS ON HIPS
     
               CHARLIE
     Not for long, you keep that up.
     
     He hops down, stands there speechless, grinning happily at 
     her.
     
               CHARLIE
     Well?
     
               MAVERICK
     Well what?
     
               CHARLIE
     You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, 
     you got your MiGs....You're our new 
     Top Gun instructor...Now what?
     
               MAVERICK
     Oh...I'll think of something... 
     What are you doing here?
     
               CHARLIE
     I live here, remember?
     
               MAVERICK
     Right on the flight line?
     
     He's got her on that one. She laughs.
     
               CHARLIE
     Everybody's got to be somewhere.
     
     
               MAVERICK
     Maybe your somewhere's with me...
     
     He puts his arms around her. Self-conscious, she pulls away, 
     a little embarrassed to show this on the flight line. He 
     laughs.
     
               MAVERICK
     That's okay. I always look forward 
     to a challenge. 
     
     
     Now she laughs back and puts her arms around him. She kisses 
     him and now she doesn't give a damn who sees it.
