          1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. I

          A vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets
          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills
          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse
          of rolling parkland.

          "It is a truth universally
          acknowledged...

          Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,
          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new
          occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the
          imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the
          window, we see a young man get out.

          "that a single man in possession of a
          good fortune, must be in want of a wife"

          A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our
          vision.

          2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2

          Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
          her parents' conversation.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Do you not want to know who has taken it?

                         MR BENNET
          As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matter...

          3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
          to the library.

                         LYDIA

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.

                         KITTY
          With five thousand a year!
          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.

                         JANE
          Goodness!

                         LYDIA
          - and he's single to be sure!

          INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          What a fine thing for our girls!

                         MR BENNET
          Bow can it affect them?

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.

                         MR BENNET
          Oh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.

          4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME.

          Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room
          pursued by Mrs Bennet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MRS BENNET
          - So you must go and visit him at once.

          5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5

          Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
          girls come in to listen.

                         LYDIA
          Oh, yes, Papa.

                         KITTY
          Please, Papa!

                         MR BENNET
          There is no need, for I already have.
          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.

                         MRS BENNET
          You have?

                         JANE
          when?

                         MRS BENNET
          â€¢ How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
          no compassion for my poor nerves?

                         MR BENNET
          You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them; they are my constant
          companions these twenty years.

                         MRS BENNET
          Is he amiable?

                         KITTY
          Is he handsome?

                         LYDIA
          He's sure to be handsome.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IRONICALLY)
          With five thousand a year, it would not
          matter if he had a big pink face.

                         MR BENNET
          I will give my hearty consent to his
          marrying whichever of the girls he
          chooses.

                         LYDIA
          So will he come to the ball tomorrow?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         MR BENNET
          I believe so.
          Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.

                         KITTY

                         (TO JANE)
          I have to have your spotted muslin,
          please!

                         LYDIA
          I need it!

                         KITTY
          - if you do, I'll lend you my green
          slippers.
          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.

                         MR BENNET
          And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?

                         MARY
          Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          â€¢ amusement as quite desirable.
          Elizabeth laughs.

          6 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOMS -- MERYTON VILLAGE - NIGHT.

          The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a
          rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman
          farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked
          daughters.
          Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over
          their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying
          their hair and so on.

                         LYDIA
          (fussing over her dress)
          I literally can't breathe its so tight.

                         KITTY
          My toes hurt.
          Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.
          Jane looks breathtaking.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Well, if every man in this room does not
          end the evening completely in love with
          you then I am no judge of beauty.

                         JANE
          Or men.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, they are far too easy to judge.

                         JANE
          They are not all bad.

                         ELIZABETH
          Humourless poppycocks, in my limited
          experience.

                         JANE
          One of these days, Lizzie, someone will
          catch your eye and then you'll have to
          watch your tongue.

                         ELIZABETH
          And eat my hat.
          She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters
           the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but
          â€¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.

                         JANE
          Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.
          A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The
          newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a
          stir.

                         CUT TO:
          Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the
          somewhat provincial gathering with distaste.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
          are we not, Mr Darcy?
          He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On
          the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,
          trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets
          himself and openly looks at her.

                         MR BINGLEY
          I find it very charming.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          My brother is so easily pleased, is he
          not?
          Darcy does not answer.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an
          intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They
          spy through the crowd.

                         ELIZABETH
          So which of the painted peacocks is our
          Mr Bingley?

                         CHARLOTTE
          He is on the right, and on the left is
          his sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          And the person with the disagreeable
          expression?

                         CHARLOTTE
          That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Poor soul.

                         CHARLOTTE
          On the contrary, he has ten thousand a
          year and owns half of Derbyshire.

                         CUT TO:
          Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member
          of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to
          introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter
          Charlotte and the Bennet family.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          (to Mr Bingley)
          My eldest daughter you know, Mrs
          Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and
          Miss Mary Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          It is a pleasure. I have two others but

                         40
          they are already dancing.

          Delighted to make your acquaintance.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          And may I introduce Mr Darcy.

                         (SIGNIFICANT LOOK)
          -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!
          A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.

                         CUT TO:
          Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group
          with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't
          keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in
          disguising his instant ardour.

                         ELIZABETH
          How do you like it here in Hertfordshire,
          Mr Bingley?

                         MR BINGLEY
          (smiling at Jane shyly)
          Very much.

                         ELIZABETH
          The library at Netherfield, I've heard,
          is one of the finest in the country.

                         Â€¢

                         MR BINGLEY
          Yes, it fills me with guilt.
          He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.

                         BINGLEY
          Not a good reader, you see. I like being
          out of doors. I mean, I can read, of

                         COURSE -
          His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his
          ears.

                         MISS BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is
          astonishingly good.

                         DARCY
          Thank you. It is the work of many
          generations.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          And then you have added so much to it
          yourself.

                         JANE
          I wish I read more, but there always
          seems so many other things to do.

                         BINGLEY
          That's exactly what I meant.
          He beams at Jane.

                         CUT TO:
          Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and
          the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them
          in a state of high excitement.

          They leave, to dance.

          Do you dance Mr Darcy?

          Not if I can help it.
          Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
          they over hear the following...

                         LYDIA
          It's easy. You just walk up and down in
          front of them and drop something.
          Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         LYDIA
          â€¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
          sir' and blush prettily and then you're
          introduced!

                         MR BENNET
          I have long suspected that we have two of
          the silliest girls in the county.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
          young colonel with six thousand a year
          should want one of my girls I shall not
          say nay to him.
          Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
          moves away.

                         CUT TO:
          The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His
          ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,
          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
          with rather too obvious satisfaction.

                         MRS BENNET
          7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7
          â€¢ Though of course my Jane needs little
          help from couturiers.
          Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
          Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and
          demure, he clearly smitten -

                         CUT TO:
          Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.

                         BINGLEY
          Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
          to see you standing by yourself in this
          stupid manner.

                         MR DARCY
          (shakes his head)
          You know how I detest it.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Upon my word, I've never seen so many
          pretty girls in my life.

                         DARCY
          You are dancing with the only handsome
          girl in the room.

                         Â€¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         BINGLEY
          Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I
          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
          very agreeable.
          They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
          not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close
          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
          conversation.

                         DARCY
          Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
          handsome enough to tempt me.
          Elizabeth's smile drops.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          You had better return to your partner and
          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
          your time with me.
          Bingley goes off.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
          Bingley's exchange.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a
          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
          to be liked by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I would not dance with him
          for half of Derbyshire.

                         CUT TO:
          Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he
          does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody
          else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every
          dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.
          Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and
          chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely
          superior boredom on his fine features.

                         CUT TO:
          Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and
          Darcy.

                         BINGLEY

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing
          young woman.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Yes! I adore her.

                         MRS BENNET
          It is a pity she is not more handsome.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mama!

                         MRS BENNET
          But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.

                         (TO BINGLEY)
          Of course it's my Jane who's considered
          the beauty of the county.

                         JANE
          Oh, Mama, please!

                         MRS BENNET
          When she was only fifteen there was a
          gentleman so much in love with her that I
          was sure he would make her an offer.
          However, he did write her some very
          pretty verses.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          And so ended their affection. I wonder
          â€¢ who first discovered the power of poetry
          in driving away love?

                         DARCY
          I thought that poetry was the food of
          love.

                         ELIZABETH
          Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything
          nourishes what is strong already. But if
          it is only a thin, slight sort of
          inclination, I'm convinced that one good
          sonnet will starve it away entirely.
          Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of
          interest.

                         DARCY
          So what do you recommend, to encourage
          affection?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones
          partner is barely tolerable.
          She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He
          has no idea she heard him. He blushes.

                         Â€¢

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Elizabeth is dancing happily in a round, Jane and Bingley
          â€¢ are also in the same dance. At the edge of the dance
          floor Darcy is watching.

          7 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 7

          Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed,
          but are too excited to sleep.

                         JANE
          Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought
          to be. Sensible, good humoured -

                         ELIZABETH
          (completing the list)
          Handsome, conveniently rich -

                         JANE
          You know perfectly well I do not believe
          marriage should be driven by thoughts of
          money.

                         ELIZABETH
          I agree entirely, only the deepest love
          will persuade me into matrimony, which is
          why I will end up an old maid.

                         JANE
          Do you really believe he liked me,
          Lizzie?

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane, he danced with you most of the
          night.

                         JANE
          I was flattered, I must admit. I did not
          expect such a compliment.

                         ELIZABETH
          That is one great difference between us.
          Compliments always take you by surprise.
          Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very
          amiable, and I give you leave to like
          him. You've liked many a stupider person.

                         JANE
          Lizzie!

                         ELIZABETH
          You're a great deal too apt to like
          people in general, you know. All the
          world is good and agreeable in your eyes.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         Â€¢ JANE
          Not his friend. I still cannot believe
          what he said about you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive
          his vanity had he not wounded mine. But
          no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak
          again.
          She blows out the candle.

          8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8

          Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless
          description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,
          whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.

                         MRS BENNET
          And then he danced the third with Miss
          Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is
          not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss
          King of little standing. And the fifth
          again with Jane.

                         MR BENNET
          â€¢ If he'd had any compassion for me he
          would have sprained his ankle in the
          first dance.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the
          girls looked forward to a grand
          inheritance.
          Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this
          speech many times before.

                         MR BENNET

                         (NOT LISTENING)
          Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.

                         MRS BENNET
          As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you
          die, which may in fact be very soon, our
          girls will be left without a roof over
          their head nor a penny to their name.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the
          morning.
          Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's
          â€¢ babbling.

                         MRS HILL
          â€¢ A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn.
          From Netherfield Hall.

                         MRS BENNET
          Praise the Lord! We are saved.
          Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy
          day!

                         JANE
          It is from Miss Bingley.
          Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          She has invited me to dine with her.

                         (PAUSE)
          Her brother will be dining out.

                         MRS BENNET
          This is most unfortunate.

                         LYDIA
          I didn't think he was so good looking
          anyway.

                         JANE
          Can I take the carriage?

                         MRS BENNET
          Certainly not my dear, you will go to
          Netherfield on horse back.

                         JANE
          Horseback?!
          Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.

          An open book. Plop plop! Raindrops fall on it. Drawing

          Mrs Bennet stands at the kitchen door. A boy is
          delivering meat. It starts to rain. She puts out her
          hand, to check.

                         MRS BENNET
          (smiles, satisfied)
          Ah, good...
          The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused
          at her mistress's reaction.

          12 EXT. GARDEN - DAY. 12

          A louder rumble of thunder. A washerwoman hastily pulls

          Mr and Mrs Bennet look out at the pouring rain.

                         MRS BENNET
          Excellent. Now she will have to stay the
          night. Exactly as I predicted.

                         MR BENNET
          Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art
          of match-making are without question.

                         ELIZABETH
          Though I don't think, mama, you can
          reasonably take credit for making it
          rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her
          death before she gets there.

          not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a.
          fever, and a headache there is nothing
          wrong with me." This is ridiculous.

                         MR BENNET
          Well, my dear, if your daughter does die
          it will be a comfort to know it was all
          in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

                         MRS BENNET
          People do not die of colds.

                         ELIZABETH
          Though she might well perish with the
          shame of having such a mother.
          Mr Bennet laughs.

                         ELIZABETH
          I am going to Netherfield at once.

                         MRS BENNET
          Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the
          girls took the carriage to town.

                         ELIZABETH
          Then I will walk there. We should not
          leave Jane alone in her condition.

                         MRS BENNET
          Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by
          the time you get there.

                         MR BENNET
          Why the devil not. We could have them all
          laid up at Netherfield Hall.

                         ELIZABETH
          I will be fit for Jane which is all I

          Elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as

          are eating breakfast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Its very formal, in fact frigid, compared to the
          volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the
          â€¢ newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          (puts down the letter)
          Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating
          her ballroom in the French style. A
          little unpatriotic, don't you think?
          Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A
          footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval.

                         FOOTMAN
          Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
          Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in
          mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then
          quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished,
          looks her up and down.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked
          here?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm so sorry. How is my sister?

                         DARCY

                         (MORE KINDLY)
          She's upstairs.

                         (TO FOOTMAN)
          Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred.
          Lizzie leaves. A beat.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six
          inches deep in mud!
          No response.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          And her hair, so blowsy and untidy!

                         DARCY
          I think her concern for her sister does
          her credit.
          A little pause, Caroline recovers.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold.
          I dislike excessively being ill myself.

          18.

          â€¢ 19 INT. NETHERFIELD LANDING - DAY. I

          Elizabeth is taken upstairs. Bingley, looking tense,
          waits outside her sister's room. His face lights up when
          he sees her.

                         BINGLEY
          Miss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you
          A doctor comes out of Jane's room.

          ELIZABETH AND BINGLEY

                         (TOGETHER)
          How is she?

                         DOCTOR
          A violent cold, but we shall get the
          better of it.

          20 INT. NETHERFIELD - JANE'S BEDROOM - DAY. 20

          Elizabeth goes into the bedroom where Jane lies in bed,
          feverish and ill.

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane!
          Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.

                         JANE
          Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're
          being so kind to me, I feel such a
          terrible imposition.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I don't know who is more
          pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr
          Bingley.
          Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Thank you for tending to my sister so
          diligently, it seems she is in better
          comfort here than she would be at home.

                         BINGLEY
          It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her
          so sick, of course, that's terrible. I
          will have a room made up for you. You
          must be our guest here until Jane
          recovers.

                         Â€¢

          21 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD -- DAY. 21

          Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about
          anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but
          save being an excellent walker, there is
          very little to recommend her.

                         BINGLEY
          I thought she showed remarkable spirit
          coming all this way.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I
          hold in excessive regard and I wish her
          well settled. Though I do fear with her
          families low connections there is little
          chance of it. Their uncle is in trade,
          you know, in Cheapside.

                         BINGLEY
          If they had uncles enough to fill all
          Cheapside it would not make them one jot
          less agreeable.

          22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22

          Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the
          hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with
          herself.

                         MRS BENNET
          Well, my dear, its all going according
          to plan. He's half in love with her
          already!

                         MR BENNET
          (a touch disingenuously)
          Who, my sweetest?

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she
          hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the
          two of them.
          Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia
          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
          lights up.

          â€¢ MRS BENNET
          Wait for me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing
          â€¢ figures.

          23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23

          Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.

          24 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 24

          Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter.
          Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored,
          wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over
          Darcy's shoulder.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

                         MR DARCY
          (without looking up)
          â€¢ You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
          Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          How many letters you must have occasion
          to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business
          too. How odious I should think them!

                         DARCY
          It is fortunate, then, that they fall to
          my lot instead of yours.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Please tell your sister that I long to
          see her.

                         DARCY
          I have already told her once, by your
          desire.
          Lizzie looks across from her book.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures
          at her beautiful little design for a
          table.

                         Â€¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         DARCY

                         Â€¢
          Perhaps you will give me leave to defer
          your raptures till I write again. At
          present I have not enough room to do them
          justice.
          Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Its amazing, how young ladies have the
          patience to be so accomplished.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          What do you mean, Charles?

                         MR BINGLEY
          They all paint tables, and embroider
          cushions and play the piano. I never
          heard of a young lady, but people say she
          is accomplished.

                         DARCY
          The word is indeed applied too liberally.
          I cannot boast of knowing more than half
          a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,
          that are truely accomplished.

          â€¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Nor I, to be sure!

                         ELIZABETH
          Goodness! You must comprehend a great
          deal in the idea.

                         DARCY
          I do.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Absolutely. She must have a thorough
          knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
          dancing and the modern languages, to
          deserve the word. And something in her
          air and manner of walking.

                         DARCY
          And of course she must improve her mind
          by extensive reading.
          Elizabeth closes her book.

                         ELIZABETH
          i am no longer surprised at your knowing
          only six accomplished women. I rather
          wonder now at your knowing any.

                         Â€¢

                         DARCY
          Are you so severe on your own sex?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ I never saw such a woman. She would
          certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.
          Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley
          picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to

                         LIZZIE_

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Miss Bennet, let us take a turn about the
          room.
          Lizzie, surprised, gets up. Caroline Bingley links her
          arm and they start walking up and down.

          CAROLINE BINGLEY (CONT'D)
          It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting
          so long in one attitude?

                         ELIZABETH
          And it's a small kind of accomplishment,
          I suppose.
          Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his
          letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline
          Bingley turns to Darcy.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Mr Darcy, will you join us?

                         DARCY
          (shakes his head)
          You can only have two motives, Miss
          Bingley, and I would interfere with
          either.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          (to Lizzie, archly)
          What can he mean?

                         ELIZABETH
          Our surest way of disappointing him will
          be to ask nothing about it.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          Please tell us!

                         DARCY
          Either you are in each other's confidence
          and have secret affairs to discuss, or
          you are conscious that your figures
          appear to the greatest advantage by
          walking. If the first, I should get in
          your way. If the second, I can admire you
          â€¢ much better from here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          â€¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh, shocking! How shall we punish him for
          such a speech?

                         ELIZABETH
          We could always tease him.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!

                         ELIZABETH
          Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
          you consider that a fault?

                         DARCY
          That I couldn't say.

                         ELIZABETH
          For we're trying to find a fault in you.

                         DARCY
          Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
          the follies and vices of others, or their
          offences against myself. My good opinion,
          once lost, is lost forever.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that.
          What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          A family trait I think.
          Elizabeth smiles, sweetly. Miss Bingley glances at Darcy.

          Elizabeth wakes up next to Jane.

          26 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY. 26

          Darcy gallops through the countryside.

          27 EXT. STABLE YARD - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 27

          Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the
          corner is a trough and pump. He strides up to the pump,
          puts his head under it and douses himself with cold
          water.

          From a window Elizabeth looks out at Darcy.
          Darcy looks up and for a second catches Elizabeth looking
          down at him. She turns from the window. Jane is waking
          up.

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane, do you think you might feel well
          enough to leave today?

          29 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 29

          The doors open. The Butler as before:

                         BUTLER
          A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss
          Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Are we to receive every Bennet in the
          country?
          Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to
          Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath
          as her mother launches into untold gaucheries.

                         MRS BENNET
          What an excellent room you have sir. Such
          expensive furnishings. I hope you intend
          to stay here, Mr Bingley.

                         BINGLEY
          Absolutely I find the country very
          diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

                         DARCY
          I find it perfectly adequate even if
          society is a little less varied than in
          town.

                         MRS BENNET
          But I assure you there is quite as much
          going on in the country as there is in
          the town.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely
          meant there were not such a variety of

          Nonsense, we dine with four and twenty
          families. Sir William Lucas for instance
          is a very agreeable man. So very genteel
          and easy.
          Elizabeth cringes.

                         LYDIA
          Mr Bingley, is it true that you have
          promised to hold a ball here at
          Netherfield?

                         BINGLEY
          Well...

                         LYDIA
          It would be an excellent way to meet new
          friends. You could invite the militia.

                         KITTY
          Oh do hold a ball.

                         ELIZABETH

                         BINGLEY
          When your sister has recovered you shall
          name the day.

                         MARY
          I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational
          way to gain new acquaintance. It would be
          better if conversation instead of dancing
          were the order of the day.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Indeed much more rational but rather less
          like a ball.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Mary.

                         BINGLEY
          (to Mrs Bennet)
          Please let me show you to Jane, you will

          The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered
          to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of
          health.

                         JANE
          (to the Bingley's)
          Really, I don't know how to thank you.
          Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.

                         BINGLEY
          Really, you're welcome anytime you feel
          the least bit poorly.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She

          They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the
          Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley
          waves enthusiastically to Jane.

                         BINGLEY
          Goodbye. Goodbye.

          The family are all squeezed in rather too tightly.

          What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy

          The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the

          Lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of
          soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men
          looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest.

                         LYDIA
          I can't believe it, there must be a
          thousand of them.
          Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very

          the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet.

                         MR BENNET
          I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a
          good dinner today, because I have reason

          Collins, late twenties, an overweening sychophant,
          nervous and unctuous in equal measure. He sits in his
          black garb, hunched uncomfortably as he comes through
          town.

          COLLINS (V.O.)
          "Dear sir, the disagreement subsisting
          between yourself and my late father over
          the entail to me of the Longbourn estate,
          has long been a subject of much torment
          which I have frequently wished to heal.
          Having received ordination this Easter
          and being so fortunately distinguished by
          the patronage of the Right Honorable Lady
          Catherine de Bourgh..."
          Collins' voice fades out as his carriage wipes through
          frame revealing Elizabeth and Charlotte on their way to
          the butchers.

          Who's to inherit?

                         LIZZIE
          Indeed. Everything, apparently. He may
          leave us our stays, but even my piano
          stool belongs to Mr Collins.

                         CHARLOTTE
          When?

                         LIZZIE
          He can turn us out of the house as soon
          as he pleases.

                         CHARLOTTE
          But why?

                         LIZZIE
          Because the estate is entailed to him and
          not to us poor females.
          A cart passes, crammed with sheep going to slaughter.

          36 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 36

          Mr Collins is ushered in by the manservant, Perkins. He
          looks around his future home with interest.
          Mr and Mrs Bennet greet him.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (DEEP BOW )
          Mr Collins, at your service.

                         (LOOKS AROUND)
          What a charming house! So convenient for
          the local village.
          (looks at the furniture)
          And some very fine pieces, if I'm not
          mistaken.
          A beat. This is hardly tactful.

                         MRS BENNET

                         (COLDLY)
          They are.
          Jane, Lizzie and Mary enter.

                         MR COLLINS
          Ah, these are your daughters, are they
          not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         MR BENNET
          We have some more somewhere.

                         MR COLLINS
          I must congratulate you. I have heard
          much of their beauty, but in this
          instance fame has fallen short of the
          truth.
          A very low bow. The girls are somewhat taken aback.

          37 INT. DINING ROOM -- NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 37

          The Bennets and Collins are seated formally for supper.
          Mr Collins is served some food.

                         COLLINS
          What a superbly featured room and what
          excellent boiled potatoes. It is many
          years since I had such an exemplary
          vegetable. To which of my fair cousins
          should I compliment the excellence of the
          cooking?

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep
          a cook.

                         Â€¢

                         COLLINS
          Excellent. I am very pleased the estate
          affords such a living. I am honoured to
          have, as my patroness, Lady Catherine de
          Bourg, you have heard of her, I presume?
          Mrs Bennet shakes her head.

                         MR COLLINS
          My small rectory abuts her estate,
          Rosings Park, and she often condescends
          to drive by my humble abode in her little
          phaeton and ponies.
          A pause. Lizzie catches her father's eye.

                         MRS BENNET
          Does she have any family?

                         MR COLLINS
          One daughter, the heiress of Rosings and
          very extensive property. I have often
          observed to Lady Catherine, that her
          daughter seemed born to be a duchess for
          she has all the superior graces of
          â€¢ elevated rank.

          30.
          MR COLLINS (cont'd)
          .These are the kind of little delicate
          compliments that are always acceptable to
          1ï¿½1 ladies, and which I conceive myself
          particularly bound to pay.

                         MR BENNET

                         (GRAVELY)
          How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess
          the talent for flattering with delicacy.
          Mr Collins nods with satisfaction.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do these pleasing attentions proceed from
          the impulse of the moment or are they the
          result of previous study?
          Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not
          to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.

                         MR COLLINS
          They arise chiefly from what is passing
          at the time, and though I sometimes amuse
          myself with arranging such little elegant
          compliments, I always wish to give them
          as unstudied an air as possible.

                         ELIZABETH
          Believe me, no one would suspect your
          manners to be practised.
          The girls look at one another.

                         COLLINS
          After dinner I thought I might read to
          you all an hour or two. I have with me
          Fordyce's sermons which speak eloquently
          on this point.

                         (TO JANE)
          Do you know Fordyce's sermons Miss
          Bennet?

          38 INT. CORRIDOR -- LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 38

          Later; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the
          fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and
          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out
          of hearing of anyone else.

                         COLLINS
          Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been
          bestowed by the good grace of Lady
          Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean
          size.

          â€¢ MRS BENNET
          I have become aware of the fact.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         COLLINS
          â€¢ Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I
          may find a mistress for it, and I have to
          inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet
          has captured my special attention.
          Collins looks lasciviously into the room.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent
          on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
          is - very soon to be engaged.

                         COLLINS
          Engaged!

                         MRS BENNET
          But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both
          age and beauty would make anyone an
          excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr
          Collins?
          Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth

                         COLLINS
          Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable
          alternative.

                         Â€¢

          39 EXT. BACK MEADOW - LONGBOURN - DAY. 39

          Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when,
          across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the
          house and advance towards them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh no!
          Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the
          garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Quick! This way!
          She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat,
          through the house and out the front.
          Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.
          The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around,
          puzzled.

          40 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 40

          â€¢ Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever
          the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed
          and reckless. She looks behind them-

          We've lost him.
          They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the
          milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are
          chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted
          earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled
          hair. The perfect romantic hero.

                         ELIZABETH
          Kitty? Lydia!
          She and Jane join them.

                         LYDIA
          We just happened to be looking for some
          ribbon, didn't we, Kitty?

                         (KITTY NODS)
          And we met Mr Wickham.

                         KITTY
          He picked up Lydia's gloves!

                         LYDIA
          He's a lieutenant!
          Wickham bows.

                         WICKHAM
          I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some
          ribbons together?

                         LYDIA
          Oh yes!

          41 INT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 41

          They come into the shop. The others go towards the
          counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit,
          witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours.

                         WICKHAM
          Though I must warn you, I have very poor
          taste.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES)
          Only a man truly confident of himself
          would admit that.

                         WICKHAM
          No, it's true. My rooms in town,
          decorated, I thought, in the height of
          â€¢ fashion, have reduced grown men to tears
          of mirth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         ELIZABETH'

                         Â€¢ (LAUGHS)
          Then why don't you change them?

                         MR WICKHAM
          And deny people such pleasure?

                         ELIZABETH
          So you don't mind being laughed at?

                         MR WICKHAM
          Not particularly.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it
          not, to be aware of ones importance in
          the world.

                         WICKHAM
          Especially if, like me, one has none.
          Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment
          is broken by Lydia coming up.

                         LYDIA
          Lizzie, please lend me some money!

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â€¢
          You already owe me a considerable sum,
          Liddy.

                         MR WICKHAM
          Allow me to oblige.

                         ELIZABETH
          No! Please - Mr Wickham! -
          Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the
          counter.

          42 EXT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 42

          The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're too generous.

                         WICKHAM
          I know. Fivepence halfpenny!

                         ELIZABETH
          It all adds up.

                         Â€¢ LYDIA
          I'll pay him back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         WICKHAM
          Oh yes. I'll make sure of that.

                         Â€¢
          They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.
          They walk down the street.

                         ELIZABETH
          Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr
          Wickham?

                         WICKHAM
          That depends on what the French have in
          mind. Of course I look forward to
          action...
          (smiles at her)
          But on the other hand

                         JANE
          Lizzie - look!
          They stop. Jane's face lights up.

                         JANE
          Mr Bingley !
          It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
          accompanied by Darcy.
          â€¢ Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
          open, friendly face is filled with delight.

                         BINGLEY
          I was on my way to your house.

                         LYDIA -
          Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to
          give a ball?

                         JANE
          Lydia!

                         BINGLEY
          I was just waiting until your sister was
          quite well.-

                         LYDIA
          She is!
          Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
          conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
          turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
          recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.

                         KITTY
          - when, then?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MR BINGLEY

                         Â€¢
          As soon as they have made the white soup.

                         LYDIA
          Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
          Darcy turns and rides off without a word.

                         JANE
          Lydia, you can't just say that -

                         MR BINGLEY
          Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.
          Enjoy the day.
          Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.

          43 INT. DRAWING ROOM - THE LUCAS' HOUSE - DAY. 43

          A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been
          set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte
          and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small
          number of officers and other ladies are also present. We
          move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and
          Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins
          and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other
          officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.

                         Â€¢

          LYDIA.
          We have asked mama if we might have new
          dresses for the Netherfield ball.

                         KITTY
          Yes, white, they must be white.

                         LYDIA
          White is the only colour to be worn this
          season.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          So I believe.
          Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over
          at Elizabeth, as he talks.

                         COLLINS
          - of course, when you understand that
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its
          proprietor you will realise what an
          immense compliment that is. Lady
          Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a
          chimney-piece alone.
          â€¢ Wickham who has been talking to some of the other
          officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr
          collins on the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         WICKHAM
          (aside to Elizabeth)
          Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon
          capacity for charm.
          Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand.

                         LYDIA
          Will you be attending the Netherfield
          ball, Mr Wickham?

                         WICKHAM
          I hope to.

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a
          Netherfield?
          Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes
          her chance.

                         ELIZABETH
          About a month. Are you acquainted with,
          Mr Darcy?

                         WICKHAM
          Indeed, my fate has been very intimate
          with that gentleman. I have been
          connected with his family since infancy.
          Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while
          she is forced to play her hand.

                         WICKHAM (CONT'D)
          You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,
          especially given the cold manner of our
          intimacy this afternoon. Are you well
          acquainted with that gentleman?

                         ELIZABETH
          As much as I could ever wish to be. I
          have spent four days in the same house as
          him, and I think him very disagreeable.

                         WICKHAM
          I cannot pretend to be sorry.
          Elizabeth blushes.

                         WICKHAM
          But really I speak out of turn.
          Collins voice breaks the moment.

                         COLLINS
          Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir
          William what appalling weather we've been
          having.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          Elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins,
          â€¢ but she smiles politely.

                         ELIZABETH
          I think I shall take a little air.
          She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony.
          As she passes the other tables we follow and witness
          snippets of their conversations.

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (TO MARY)
          It seems Mr Wickham has met with
          universal approval. Though Lizzie looks
          singularly pleased with him.

                         MARY
          At the moment she has more suitors than
          sense.
          Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir
          William's side of the table.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Now any one for a round of bridge?
          Elizabeth?

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â€¢
          Really I need to take some air.
          Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Mr Collins?

                         COLLINS
          Oh, I am not so familiar with the game,
          Sir William.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join
          us.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd

                         PARTNER ME_
          Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and
          slips out into the night air.

          44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44

          Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses
          someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has
          followed her as she had hoped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ I hope your plans in favor of Meryton
          will not be affected by your difficult
          relations with the gentleman we were just
          speaking of.

                         WICKHAM
          Oh no - it is not for me to be driven
          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
          must go not I.
          Pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

                         WICKHAM
          Do you really want to hear?
          Lizzie nods.

                         WICKHAM
          He ruined me.
          She stares at him.

                         ELIZABETH
          How so?

                         WICKHAM
          My father managed his estate. We grew up
          together, Darcy and I. His father treated
          me like a second son. Oh he was the
          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
          living in his gift, for I had my heart
          set on joining the church. But when he
          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
          the living to another man.

                         LIZZIE
          Why did he do that?

                         WICKHAM
          Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
          more than he loved him.

                         LIZZIE
          How cruel! Are you sure?

                         WICKHAM

                         (NODS)
          And out of pride, for he considered me
          too lowly to be worth his consideration.

                         Â€¢
          Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          â€¢ 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45

          We pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare
          for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her
          dress, they are both wearing white.

                         LYDIA
          Aggghh!

                         KITTY
          Breathe in!
          We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and
          Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some
          time.

                         JANE

                         (HORRIFIED)
          - I still think there must have been a
          misunderstanding.

                         LIZZIE

                         (EXASPERATED LAUGH)
          Oh Jane, do you never think ill of
          anybody?

                         JANE
          0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I
          will discover the truth from Mr Bingley
          at the ball this evening.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict
          it himself. But until he does, I hope
          never to encounter him.

                         JANE
          Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

                         ELIZABETH
          On the contrary, he is twice the man
          Darcy is.

                         JANE
          And lets hope for you a rather more
          willing dancer.
          Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very
          particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.

          46 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - NIGHT. 46

          â€¢ The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in
          full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping
          Assembly, its a dazzling affair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two
          hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red
          â€¢ officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are
          a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,
          cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest
          room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.
          The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,
          including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr
          Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley
          bounds up to Jane.

                         BINGLEY
          You're here! I'm so pleased.

                         JANE
          And so am I.

                         BINGLEY
          How are you, Miss Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is
          searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of
          Wickham.

                         BINGLEY
          Are you, looking for someone?

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor
          of the ball.

                         JANE
          It is lovely, Mr Bingley.
          Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs
          Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on
          Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.

                         MRS BENNET
          (refering to Jane and

                         BINGLEY)
          I dare say I have never met a more
          pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look
          how he dotes on her! Still Jane has
          always done what is best for her family.
          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
           someone else.
           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see
          â€¢ him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â€¢
          Have you seen Mr Wickham.
          She shakes her head.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Perhaps he is in the ballroom.
          They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal
          a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane
          appears and catches Elizabeths arm.

                         JANE
          He's not here. Apparently otherwise
          detained.
          The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Detained?
          Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at
          Elizabeth.

                         COLLINS
          There you are.

                         Â€¢ ELIZABETH
          Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.

                         MR COLLINS
          Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss
          Elizabeth?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr
          Collins.

                         MR COLLINS
          I do not consider it incompatible with
          the office of a clergyman to indulge in
          such an innocent diversion.
          Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.

           MR COLLINS (CONT'D)
           In fact several people, her ladyship
           included, have complimented me on my
           lightness of foot.
           Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus.

                          CUT TO:
          â€¢ They dance, the style of which is not unlike English
          Country dancing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         COLLINS
          â€¢ To be sure, dancing is of little
          consequence to me, but it does afford the
          opportunity to lavish'ones partner with
          delicate attentions which is my primary
          object of the evening.
          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
          dances beside Jane.

                         JANE
          Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been
          called on some business to town, though
          my informer told me he would have been
          less inclined to be engaged had it not
          been for the presence at Netherfield of a
          certain gentleman.
          Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.

                         ELIZABETH
          That gentleman barely warrants the name.
          The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.

          COLLINS (CONT`D)
          It is my intention, if I may be so bold
          to remain close to you throughout the
          evening.

                         CUT TO:
          Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and
          Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy
          approaches.

                         DARCY
          May I have the next dance, Miss
          Elizabeth.
          Elizabeth is stunned.

                         ELIZABETH
          You may.
          Darcy walks away.

                         ELIZABETH
          What was I thinking? Have I no presence
          of mind?l

                         CHARLOTTE
          I dare say you will find him very
          agreeable, Lizzie.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         Â€¢ ELIZABETH
          Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest
          misfortune of all - to find a man
          agreeable whom one is determined to hate!

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can
          speak. They dance for a moment in silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          I do love a Sarabande.

                         DARCY
          Indeed. Most invigorating.
          They continue, for a moment, in silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is your turn to say something, Mr
          Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you
          ought to remark on the size of the room
          or the number of couples.

                         DARCY
          I am perfectly happy to oblige, please
          advise me of what you would like most to
          â€¢ hear.

                         ELIZABETH
          That reply will do for the present.
          Perhaps by and bye I may observe that
          private balls are much pleasanter than
          public ones. But for now we may be
          silent.

                         DARCY
          Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

                         ELIZABETH
          We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
          disposition, unwilling to speak, unless
          we expect to say something that will -
          amaze the whole room, and be handed down
          to posterity with all the eclat of a
          proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid
          embarrassment might be advantageous.

                         DARCY
          I see no striking resemblance of your own
          character in this, how near it is to mine
          I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and
          your sisters very often walk to Meryton?

                         Â€¢
          They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the
          dance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by
          an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth
          â€¢ looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare
          at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her
          current partner in embarrassment.

                         ELIZABETH
          Very mild weather we've been having.

                         DANCING PARTNER
          (deaf as a post)
          Sorry.
          The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a
          great opportunity to meet new people. In
          fact when you met us we had just had the
          pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

                         DARCY
          I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
          with such happy manners as may ensure his
          making friends - whether he is capable of
          retaining them is less certain.

                         ELIZABETH
          He has been so unlucky as to lose your
          friendship. I remember hearing you once
          say that your resentment once created was
          unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
          suppose, as to its being created?

                         DARCY
          I am. May I ask to what these questions
          tend.

                         ELIZABETH
          To make out your character, Mr Darcy.

                         DARCY
          And what have you discovered?

                         ELIZABETH
          very little.
          The dancefinishes.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I hear such different accounts of you as
          puzzle me exceedingly.

                         DARCY
          I hope to afford you more clarity in the
          â€¢ future.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          â€¢ They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away
          from Darcy.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge
          glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled.
          She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty
          disapprovingly.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a
          friend not to give too much confidence to
          all of the assertions your friend Mr
          Wickham might make. He is indeed a
          charming man, but one should never forget
          from where he is descended.

                         ELIZABETH
          His lack of trustworthiness and descent
          appear by your account to be the same
          thing,

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Please excuse my interterence, it was
          kindly meant.
          â€¢ A breathless Mr Collins appears.

                         COLLINS
          Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in
          Derbyshire?

                         ELIZABETH
          I believe so.

                         COLLINS
          But I must make myself known to him
          immediately!

                         ELIZABETH
          But sir -

                         COLLINS
          He is the nephew of my esteemed
          patroness, Lady Catherine.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SURPRISED)
          He is?
          Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards
          Darcy.

                         Â€¢ ELIZABETH
          Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an

                         IMPERTINENCE --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute
          embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does
          not notice him so Collins raises his voice.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Mr Darcy!
          The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns
          round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'
          obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points
          Elizabeth out to Darcy.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          What interesting relatives you have, Miss
          Bennet.
          Elizabeth walks away into another room.

                         CUT TO:
          The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.
          Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr
          Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.
          Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite
          applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.

                         ELIZABETH
          Aren't you going to do something?

                         Â€¢
          Mr Bennet walks over to the piano.

                         MR BENNET
          Mary dear, you've delighted us long
          enough.

                         MARY
          But they asked for another song.
          Mr Bennet shuts the lid.

                         MR BENNET
          Let the other young ladies have a turn.

                         CUT TO:
          Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps my family have made a competition
          to see who can expose themselves to the
          most ridicule.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.

                         Â€¢
          They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley
          clearly besotted by Jane.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Yes. I think he likes her very much.

                         CHARLOTTE
          But does she like him? There are few of
          us who are secure enough to be really in
          love without proper encouragement.
          Bingley likes her enormously but might
          not do more if she does not help him on.

                         ELIZABETH
          She is just shy and modest. If he does
          not perceive her regard he is a fool.

                         CHARLOTTE
          We are all fools in love. He does not
          know her character as we do. She should
          move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty
          of time for us to get to know them after
          we're married -
          Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing
          with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very
          flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with
          laughter.

          47 MONTAGE OF THE BALL 47
          Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks
          at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to
          later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group
          of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to
          see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut
          to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr
          Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on
          with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are
          exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on
          their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents
          dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,
          Kitty is asleep over Elizabeth's lap. This is a never-
          ending nightmare.

          48 INT. ENTRANCE HALL-- NETHERFIELD - THE WEE HOURS 48

          Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is
          sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.
          Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at
          Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the
          footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is
          standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the
          â€¢ Bennets to leave.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         MRS BENNET
          I have never had such a good time in my
          life. Mr Bingley you must have such a
          ball once a month at least.
          Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns
          ostentatiously.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mother. I really think it is time to go.

                         MRS BENNET
          Don't be impertinent. our hosts are
          perfectly happy with our company, are you
          not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you
          to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.
          We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses
          at least.
          She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like
          least of all your guests this evening?

                         ELIZABETH
          Really. This is enough.
          Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He
          turns and walks away.

          49 INT. CARRIAGE - HERTFORDSHIRE - MORNING. 49

          The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is
          light outside. Only Mrs Bennet is awake but the lack of
          an audience does not stop her from talking.

                         MRS BENNET
          Allowing for new carriages, dresses
          etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a
          wedding here at Netherfield in less than
          three months, if you ask me. Mr Bennet?

          agitation. They look at him. He sits, hesitates, then

                         ASKS:

          is MR COLLINS
          Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would
          not trouble you, that I might solicit a
          private audience with Miss Elizabeth in
          the course of the morning.
          Elizabeth is open mouthed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very
          happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time
          like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr
          Collins would like a private audience
          with your sister.
          Everyone looks in amazement.

                         ELIZABETH
          Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have
          nothing to say to me.that anybody need
          not hear.

                         MRS BENNET
          No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will
          stay where you are. Everyone else, to the
          drawing room. Mr Bennet.

          â€¢ MR BENNET
           But...

                          MRS BENNET
           Now!
          Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr
          Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to
          do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at
          her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense
          embarrassment.

                         MR COLLINS
          Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt
          the purpose of my discourse. My
          attentions have been too marked to be
          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
          house I singled you out as the companion
          of my future life.
          Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.

                         MR COLLINS
          But before I am run away with my feelings
          perhaps I may state my reasons for
          marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of
          a clergyman to set the example of
          matrimony in his parish.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          S0.
          MR COLLINS (cont'd)
          Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
          greatly to my happiness, and, thirdly,
          â€¢ that it is at the urging of my esteemed
          patroness Lady Catherine that I select a
          wife.
          We here a kick and Kitty screach from behind the door.

          MRS BENNET (V.0.)
          sshhh.

                         MR COLLINS
          My object in coming to Longbourn was to
          choose such a one from amongst Mr
          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am
          next in the entail of the estate and such
          an alliance will surely make amends for
          this.
          (drops to his knee)
          And now nothing remains for me but to
          assure you in the most animated language
          of the violence of my affections.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Collins -

                         MR COLLINS
          And that no reproach on the subject of
          fortune will cross my lips once we are
          â€¢ married.

                         ELIZABETH
          You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I
          have made no answer.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (UNPERTURBED)
          I must add, that Lady Catherine will
          thoroughly approve, when I speak to her
          of your modesty, economy and other
          amiable qualities.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but
          regret I must decline it.

                         MR COLLINS
          (momentarily taken aback, but

                         RECOVERING)
          I know ladies have their pretty little
          ways, and don't seek to seem too eager -

                         ELIZABETH
          (in some desperation)
          Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You
          could not make me happy and I'm convinced
          I'm the last woman in the world who could
          make you happy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          â€¢ MR COLLINS

                         (PAUSE)
          I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your
          refusal is merely a natural delicacy.
          Besides, you should take into account
          that despite your manifold attractions it
          is by no means certain that another offer
          of marriage may ever be made to you -

                         ELIZABETH
          (rising, deeply affronted)
          Mr Collins -

                         MR COLLINS
          So I must conclude that you simply seek
          to increase my love by suspense,
          according to the usual practice of
          elegant females.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir! I am not the sort of female to
          torment a respectable man. Please
          understand me - I cannot accept you!
          Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house.
          Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the
          tail of Elizabeth.

                         Â€¢

                         COLLINS
          Thank you, but... Head strong?

                         MRS BENNET
          - we shall have this little hiccup dealt
          with immediately, Mr Collins.
          Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins
          watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her
          mother.

          51 INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 51

          Mrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up
          in shock.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You
          must come and make Lizzy marry Mr
          Collins, for she vows she will not have
          him.

                         Â€¢
          Mr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to
          Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not
          have him, and now the danger is Mr
          Collins may not have Lizzy.

                         MR BENNET
          And what am I to do?
          Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet.

                         MRS BENNET
          Speak to Lizzy.
          They march to find Elizabeth.

          52 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 52

          Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been
          waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an
          audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly
          from the breakfast room.

                         MRS BENNET
          Tell her that you insist upon them
          marrying.

                         Â€¢ LIZZIE
          Papa, please - '.

          I can't marry him!

          Go back now and say you've changed your
          mind!

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          So, your mother insists on you marrying
          Mr Collins.-

                         MRS BENNET
          Yes, or I shall never see her again?

                         MR BENNET
          Well, Lizzie. From this day on you must
          be a stranger to one of your parents -

                         MRS BENNET

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          - who will maintain you when your father
          is dead?

                         MR BENNET
          Your mother will never see you again if
          you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will
          never see you again if you do.

                         MRS BENNET

                         MR BENNET'

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, papa.
          Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.

          53 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME 53

          Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room,
          Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits
          very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her
          hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and
          speaks to anyone who will listen.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak
          to her again! Not that I have much
          pleasure in talking to anybody. People
          who suffer as I do from nervous
          complaints can have no inclination for
          talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...
          She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-
          reading the letter.

                         ELIZABETH
          What's wrong, Jane?
          Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.

          Bingley, Caroline and Darcy sit grimly in a carriage
          which drives off.

          55 INT. CARRIAGE -- LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 55

          Darcy looks severe and stern, Caroline can't help a
          little smirk on her face. Bingley looks back longingly.

          56 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURNE - NIGHT. 56

          Elizabeth and Jane in bed.

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't understand. What would take him
          from Netherfield? Why would he not know
          when he was to return?

                         JANE
          â€¢ I have no reserves from you.
          Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.

                         ELIZABETH
          "Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
          and we are scarcely less eager to meet
          her again. I really do not think Georgina
          Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance
          and accomplishments, so much so I must
          hope to hereafter call her my sister. It
          is my duty to indulge you in no hope in
          this respect for your own self."

                         JANE
          Is that not clear enough?

                         ELIZABETH
          Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in
          love with you and is gone with him to
          persuade him otherwise.

                         JANE
          But I know her to be incapable of
          wilfully deceiving anyone.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to
          our aunt and uncle's in London.

          57 EXT. LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 57

          Jane is in a carriage. Mrs Bennet kisses her goodbye
          through the window as all the Bennets look on.

                         MRS BENNET
          Give my love to my sister. And try not to
          be so much of a burden, dear.
          Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet
          talks to Elizabeth.

                         MR BENNET
          Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be
          crossed in love now and then. It gives
          her something to think of, and a sort of
          distinction among her companions.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (DRYLY)
          I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.

                         MR BENNET
          It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've
          turned down Mr Collins you're free to go
          off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr
          Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
          would do the job credibly.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, but a less agreeable man would
          satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's
          good fortune.

                         MR KENNET
          Still, it's a comfort to know that
          whatever might befall you, you have an
          affectionate mother who will be sure to
          make the most of it.
          A small smile from Elizabeth.

          58 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY 58

          Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's
          belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte
          enters.

                         CHARLOTTE
          My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell
          you the news.

                         (DEFIANTLY)
          Mr Collins and I are engaged to be
          married.
          A stunned pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          Engaged?

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (TIMIDLY)
          You don't mind, do you?

                         ELIZABETH
          No, no...
          (tries to recover)
          Of course not.

                         CHARLOTTE
          He asked for my hand this morning .and
          I accepted him.
          Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed.
          Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her.

                         CHARLOTTE
          I can see you're surprised - coming so
          soon after his wishing to marry you...

                         ELIZABETH

                         (WEAKLY)
          No...

                         CHARLOTTE
          I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only
          a comfortable home, and considering Mr
          Collin's character, and situation in
          life, I am convinced that my chance of
          happiness with him is as fair as most
          people can hope for.

                         ELIZABETH
          And that's all you expect?

                         CHARLOTTE
          For women in our situation, what choice
          is there?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (PASSIONATELY)
          Don't speak like that, Charlotte!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CHARLOTTE
          â€¢ - to become an old maid, at best
          tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent
          on the kindness of others? Or to seek the
          protection of marriage.

                         ELIZABETH
          And we only have two choices?

                         CHARLOTTE
          Yes.
          An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest
          friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks
          cool and composed - unnervingly so.

                         ELIZABETH
          You can still change your mind,
          Charlotte.

                         CHARLOTTE
          (shakes her head)
          I'm twenty-seven years old.
          We hear the sound of the militia drums...

          59 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 59


                         0
          The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and
          officers in the red coats marching out of the village to
          the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to
          bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds
          very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other
          direction.

                         LYDIA
          It's too dreadful! They're leaving for
          Brighton.

                         ELIZABETH
          All of them?

                         KITTY
          They got the call this morning.

                         LYDIA
          Not a word of warning!
          Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for
          Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she
          gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty
          chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone.
          She walks into the post office.

                         Â€¢

          C 60 INT. VILLAGE POST OFFICE - THE SAME. 6

          The Postmaster hands a letter to Elizabeth. Elizabeth
          opens it and reads it.

                         POSTMASTER
          Bad news, Miss?

                         ELIZABETH
          It could not be worse. I have been
          invited to possibly the very last place
          on earth I would like to go.

          61 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 61

          Elizabeth comes out of the post office to reveal...
          Time has passed, the now deserted village is covered in a
          thick blanket of snow. A lonely Elizabeth walks away
          totally despondent.

          62 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE - KENT - DAY. 6<

          Charlotte's new home is a smallish but charming rectory
          in Kent. Charlotte greets Elizabeth, kissing her warmly.
          â€¢ Mr Collins bows as he ushers her in.

                         MR COLLINS
          Welcome to our humble abode...

          63 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE- DAY. 63

          There is a coop containing hens of various
          descriptions ...a.pig-stye...a vegetable patch...a rose
          bower. Charlotte and Mr Collins are showing Elizabeth
          round the place.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (POINTING)
          And from here we have a good view of
          Rosings Park, where we are honoured to
          dine at least twice a week. Her
          ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered
          for us. I should say, one of her
          ladyship's carriages, for she has
          several.

                         CHARLOTTE
          My dear, I think our guest is tired after
          her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get
          some tea.

                         T

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         MR COLLINS
          â€¢ My wife encourages me to spend as much
          time in the garden as possible, for the
          sake of my health.
          A beat. Lizzie glances at Charlotte, who remains
          impassive.

                         MR COLLINS
          I plan many improvements, of course.
          (points to house)
          I intend. to throw out a bow there, and
          plant a lime walk.
          (sharp look at Lizzie)
          Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young
          lady would be happy to be the mistress of
          such a house.
          A tiny nod from Elizabeth. She understands perfectly.

          64 INT. CHARLOTTE'S PARLOUR - HUNSFORD - DAY. 64

          Lizzie and Charlotte are at last alone. They sit down,
          with a certain relief, in a charming little parlour that
          faces the front of the house. Charlotte pours out tea.

                         CHARLOTTE
          â€¢ We shall not be disturbed here, for this
          parlour is for my own particular use.

                         (A BEAT)
          Oh Lizzie, it's such a pleasure, to run
          my own home!
          A flash of understanding between them.

          MR COLLINS (OOV)
          Charlotte! Come here!
          Charlotte jumps up and rushes to the window.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ALARMED)
          What's happened?

          MR COLLINS (OOV)
          Charlotte!

                         ELIZABETH

                         (JUMPS UP)
          Has the pig escaped?
          Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr
          Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.

                         Â€¢

                         CHARLOTTE
          Its all right. Its just Lady Catherine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          They both burst out laughing. Just for a moment, the
          â€¢ atmosphere is eased.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          Tell me, how are things concerning Mr
          Wickham?
          Elizabeth's face changes.

                         ELIZABETH
          I have not heard from Mr Wickham since
          the regiment left for Brighton, but I am
          informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of
          all matters military that he does very
          well.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Oh Lizzie.
           we hear Mr Collins rushing back into the house, and
           running up the stairs.

           COLLINS (O.S.)
           Great news! Great news!
           He comes into the room, breathlessly excited.

                          COLLINS (CONT'D)
          â€¢ We have an invitation to visit Rosings
          this evening from Lady Catherine de
          Bourgh.
          Elizabeth is not overcome with enthusiasm.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear
          cousin, about your apparel. Just put on
          that which is best among your clothes and
          Lady Catherine will not think the worse
          of you.

          65 EXT. GROUNDS OF ROSINGS - EVENING. 65

          Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across
          the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied
          hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It
          is grand without being elegant.

                         COLLINS
          One of the most extraordinary sights in
          all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone
          cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.

          66 INT. STAIRWAY -- ROSINGS - THE SAME. 66

          Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast
          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth
          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at
          it, It seem to speak, but she realizes the voice is
          Collins chiding her.

                         COLLINS
          (as the devil)
          This way!

          67 TNT. SALON - ROSINGS - DUSK. 67
          The salon at Rosings is spectacularly grand; hideously
          so. Heavy furniture, rows of servants. The three guests
          are shown in by the footman. Again Mr Collins scrapes
          the floor with his bow.

                         MR COLLINS
          Your Ladyship.
          (to the daughter)
          Miss de Bourg.
          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty
          â€¢ unspeakable, really. Her daughter is a sickly, irritable-
          looking creature.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

                         ELIZABETH
          I am, your ladyship.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          (looking her up and down)
          Hmm.
          (indicates her daughter)
          This is my daughter.

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (EAGERLY)
          It's very kind of you to ask us to dine,
          Lady Catherine.
          Lady Catherine ignores her.

                         MR COLLINS
          (whispers to Lizzie)
          The chimneypiece alone cost Â£400.
          But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room.
          Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and
          recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?

                          MR COLLINS
           Mr Darcy!
          (another deep bow)
          I had no idea we would have the honour...
          A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if
          he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie,
          trying to collect himself.

                         DARCY

                         (BOWS)
          Miss Bennet...I'm staying here.

                         LADY CATHERINE

                         (SURPRISED)
          You know my nephew?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting
          him in Hertfordshire.
          Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap,
          introduces himself.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          â€¢ Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?
          He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move
          towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards
          Lizzie.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (WHISPERING)
          You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged
          to Miss de Bourg?

                         ELIZABETH
          Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed
          to hear that.
          (looks at the girl, and
          whispers to charlotte)
          What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh
          yes, they should suit each other very
          well.
          Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more
          intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has
          more at stake.
           68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f
          9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen
          waiting, thousands of candles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          Lady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table.
          The guests wait for their orders.

                         Â€¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You sit there and you sit there. Mr
          Collins! You can't sit next to your wife!
          After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down.
          Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting
          next to Darcy. There is a pause.

                         MR DARCY
          I trust your family is in good health,
          Miss Bennet?

                         ELIZABETH
          They are, thank you.

                         (PAUSE)
          My eldest sister is currently in London,
          perhaps you happened to see her there?

                         MR DARCY

                         (AWKWARD PAUSE)
          I haven't been fortunate enough, no.
          Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine
          addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the
          table.

                         Â€¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

                         ELIZABETH
          A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Oh. Do you draw?

                         ELIZABETH
          No, not at all.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Your sisters, do they draw?

                         ELIZABETH
          Not one.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          That is very strange. But I suppose you
          had no opportunity. Your mother should
          have taken you to town every spring for
          the benefit of the masters.

                         ELIZABETH
          My mother would have no objection but my
          father hates London.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          â€¢ Has your governess left you?

                         ELIZABETH
          We never had a governess.
          Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches
          Elizabeth, keenly.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          No governess? Five daughters brought up
          at home without a governess, I never
          heard such a thing! Your mother must have
          been quite a slave to your education.

                         ELIZABETH
          (can't help smiling at this)
          Not at all, Lady Catherine.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters
          out?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, ma'am. All.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          All! What, five out at once? Very odd!
          â€¢ And you only the second - the younger
          ones out before the elders are married!
          Your youngest sisters must be very young.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I
          think it would be very hard on younger
          sisters, not to have their share of
          amusement because the elder is still
          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
          motive! It would hardly encourage
          sisterly affection.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Upon my word, you give your opinion very
          decidedly for so young a person. Pray,
          what is your age?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES)
          With three younger sisters grown up, your
          Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to

                         P C
          it.
          Lady Catherine looks astonished. Mr Collins shifts in
          his seat. Mr Darcy glances sharply - in fact, admiringly
          - at Lizzie. She's enjoying herself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          69 INT. DRAWING ROOM - ROSINGS -- NIGHT. 69

          Dinner is over and they are drinking coffee. Darcy moves
          towards Elizabeth but Lady Catherine interrupts, by
          shouting from her seat.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us!

                         ELIZABETH
          No, I beg you -

                         LADY CATHERINE
          For music is my delight. In fact there
          are few people in England who have more
          true enjoyment of music than myself, or
          better natural taste. If I had ever
          learnt, I should have been a great
          proficient.

                         (INDICATES DAUGHTER)
          So would Anne, if her health would have
          allowed her.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, I told you I play poorly -

          â€¢ MR COLLINS

                         (HISSES)
          Come come, Elizabeth, her ladyship
          demands it!
          Lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and starts to
          play. Lady Catherine takes no notice and talks loudly
          over the music.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          How does Georgina get along, Darcy?

                         DARCY
          She plays very well.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          I hope she practises. No excellence can
          be acquired without constant practice. I
          have told Mrs Collins this.
          (turns to Charlotte)
          Though you have no instrument of your own
          you are very welcome to come to Rosings
          and play on the piano in the
          housekeeper's room.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Thank you, your ladyship.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          â€¢ You would be in nobody's way", you know,
          in that part of the house.
          Darcy flinches at her bad manners. He moves away to the
          piano where Lizzie is playing - not that terribly well,
          it must be said. A moment passes.

                         ELIZABETH
          You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by
          coming in all your state to hear me, but
          I won't be alarmed even though your
          sister does play so well.

                         DARCY
          I am well enough acquainted with you,
          Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you
          even should I wish it.
          A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam
          joins them.

                         FITZWILLIAM

                         (INDICATING DARCY)
          What was my friend like, in
          Hertfordshire?

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ You really care to know?
          The colonel nods.

                         ELIZABETH
          Prepare yourself for something very
          dreadful.

                         (STOPS PLAYING)
          The first time I saw him, at the
          Assembly, he danced with nobody at all -
          even though gentlemen were scarce and
          there was more than one young lady who
          was sitting down without a partner.

                         DARCY

                         (COLOURING )
          I knew nobody beyond my own party.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES SWEETLY)
          True, and nobody can be introduced in a
          ballroom.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Fitzwilliam! Come here and talk to us!
          0 Fitzwilliam moves away. Darcy and Elizabeth are alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         DARCY
          I do not have the talent of conversing
          easily with people I have never met
          before.

                         ELIZABETH
          Maybe you should take your aunt's advice
          and practice.
          Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and
          carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck.
          She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.

          70 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 70

          Elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room. She
          starts "Dear Jane..:" The doorbell rings in the
          background, she thinks nothing of it and continues. The
          maid opens the door to the drawing room and Mr Darcy
          enters.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ASTONISHED)
          Mr Darcy!
          An awkward pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, do be seated.

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on
          business to the village.
          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up
          and down.

                         DARCY
          This is a charming house. I believe my
          aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
          Collins first arrived.

                         ELIZABETH
          I believe so -- and she could not have
          bestowed her kindness on a more grateful

                         SUBJECT-
          Another pause.

                         DARCY
          Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his
          choice of wife.

                         Â€¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         ELIZABETH
          He is indeed lucky to have found one of
          the few sensible women who would have
          accepted him.
          Darcy sits down.

                         ELIZABETH
          Shall I call for some tea?

                         DARCY
          No. Thankyou.
          The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.

                         DARCY
          Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a
          pleasure.
          He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused
          and intrigued.

                         CUT TO:
          Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy
          hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly.
          Charlotte gazes after him in surprise.
          â€¢ Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds
          Elizabeth sitting, bemused.

                         CHARLOTTE
          What on earth have you done to poor Mr
          Darcy?

          ELIZABETH.
          I have no idea.
          73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73

          71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71

          Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "
          church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to
          Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-
          looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth
          joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
          together.

                         ELIZABETH
          How long do you plan to stay in Kent,
          Colonel?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his
          disposal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         ELIZABETH
          I do imagine your cousin brought you down
          with him chiefly to have someone to order
          around. I wonder he does not marry and
          secure a lasting convenience of that
          kind.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          She would be a lucky woman.

                         ELIZABETH
          Really?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          Darcy is a most loyal companion. From
          what I heard, on our journey here, he
          recently came to the rescue of one of his
          friends just in time.
          Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
          church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
          Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
          to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
          at the churchyard gate.

                         ELIZABETH
          What happened?

                         Â€¢

                         FITZWILLIAM
          He saved the man from an imprudent
          marriage.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FALTERING SLIGHTLY)
          Who was the man?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          His closest friend. Mr Bingley.
          A silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
          this interference?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          There were apparently strong objections
          to the lady.

                         ELIZABETH
          What kind of objections? Her lack of
          fortune?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I think it was her family that was
          considered unsuitable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         ELIZABETH
          So he separated them?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I believe so. I know nothing else.
          Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
          joined by his aunt.

                         ELIZABETH
          I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well
          in finding partners suitable to their
          very high standards. Good morning, Col.
          Fitzwilliam.
          76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76
          parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a
          distance.

          72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72

          Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly
          cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could
          Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.

                         CUT TO:
          â€¢ A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
          bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
          sits down, heavily, on a bench.
          Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
          lashed landscape.
          A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
          It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
          her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
          He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
          notice her upset face.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
          I can bear it no longer ... . The past
          months have been a torment...
          He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
          astonishment. He struggles on.

                         DARCY
          I came to Rosings with the single object
          of seeing you...I had to see you...

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         DARCY
          â€¢ I've fought against my better judgement,
          my family's expectation...

                         (PAUSE)
          The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank
          and circumstance...

                         (STUMBLINGLY)
          all those things.. .but I'm willing to put
          them aside... and ask you to end my
          agony...

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't understand...

                         DARCY

                         (WITH PASSION)
          I love you. Most ardently.
          Elizabeth stares at him.

                         DARCY
          Please do me the honour of accepting my
          hand.
          A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
          confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (VOICE SHAKING)
          Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have
          been through, and I am very sorry to have
          caused you pain. Believe me, it was
          unconsciously done.
          A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.

                         DARCY

                         (STARES)
          Is this your reply?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, sir.

                         DARCY
          Are you laughing at me?

                         ELIZABETH
          No?

                         DARCY
          Are you rejecting me?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm sure that the feelings which, as
          you've told me, have hindered your
          regard, will help you in overcoming it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can
          â€¢ move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.

                         DARCY
          Might I ask why, with so little endeavour
          at civility, I am thus repulsed?

                         ELIZABETH
          (trembling with emotion)
          I might as well enquire why, with so.
          evident a design of insulting me, you
          chose to tell me that you liked me
          against your better judgement. If I was
          uncivil, that was some excuse -

                         DARCY
          Believe me, I didn't mean -

                         ELIZABETH
          But I have other reasons, you know I
          have!

                         DARCY
          What reasons?

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think that anything might tempt me
          to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps
          for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
          sister?
          Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the
          face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
          separated a young couple who loved each
          other, exposing your friend to the
          censure of the world for caprice, and my
          sister to its derision for disappointed
          hopes, and involving them both in misery
          of the acutest kind?

                         DARCY
          I do not deny it.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (BLURTS OUT)
          How could you do it?

                         DARCY
          Because I believed your sister
          indifferent to him.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Indifferent?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DARCY
          â€¢ I watched them most carefully, and
          realized his attachment was much deeper
          than hers.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's because she's shy!

                         DARCY
          Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded
          that she didn't feel strongly for him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Because you suggested it!

                         DARCY
          I did it for his own good.

                         ELIZABETH
          My sister hardly shows her true feelings
          to me!
          (pause, takes a breath)
          I suppose you suspect that his fortune
          had some bearing on the matter?

                         DARCY

                         (SHARPLY)
          No! I wouldn't do your sister the

                         Â€¢
          dishonour. Though it was suggested -

                         (STOPS)

                         ELIZABETH
          What was?

                         DARCY
          It was made perfectly clear that-an
          advantageous marriage...

                         (STOPS)

                         ELIZABETH
          Did my sister give that impression?

                         DARCY -
          No!
          An awkward pause.

                         DARCY
          There was, however, I have to admit...
          the matter of your family -

                         ELIZABETH
          Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't
          vex himself about that!

                         Â€¢

                         DARCY
          No, it was more than that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         ELIZABETH
          How, sir?

                         DARCY
          (pause, very uncomfortable)
          It pains me to say this, but it was the
          lack of propriety shown by your mother,
          your three younger sisters - even, on
          occasion, your father. Forgive me.
          Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.

                         DARCY
          You and your sister -- I must exclude from
          this...
          Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
          glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.

                         ELIZABETH
          And what about Mr Wickham?

                         DARCY
          Mr Wickham?

                         ELIZABETH
          What excuse can you give for your
          behavior to him?

                         Â€¢

                         DARCY
          You take an eager interest in that
          gentleman's concerns!

                         ELIZABETH
          He told me of his misfortunes.

                         DARCY
          Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very
          great indeed!

                         ELIZABETH
          You have ruined his chances, and yet
          treat him with sarcasm?

                         DARCY
          So this is your opinion of me! Thank you
          for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
          offences might have been overlooked, if
          your pride had not been hurt -

                         ELIZABETH
          My pride?

                         DARCY
          - by my honesty in admitting scruples
          about our relationship.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                          DARCY (CONT'D)
           Could you expect me to rejoice in the
           inferiority of your circumstances?

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          And those are the words of a gentleman?
          From the first moment I met you, your
          arrogance and conceit, your selfish
          distain of the feelings of others, made
          me realize that you were the last man in
          the world I could ever be prevailed upon
          to marry.
          Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.

                         DARCY
          Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much
          of your time.
          He leaves, abruptly.
          Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What
          has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.

          73 INT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 73

          Elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to
          her.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Elizabeth!

                         ELIZABETH
          I was caught somewhat off-guard.

          74 INT. BEDROOM - HUNSFORD - THE SAME. 74

          Charlotte attends to Elizabeth.who has changed and is
          drying her hair, a shawl around her shoulders.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Shall I call the doctor?

                         ELIZABETH
          No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all
          right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my
          apologies. You must not keep her waiting.
          Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.

                         COLLINS
          (popping his head around the

                         DOOR)
          Come on. We shall be late!

                         Â€¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Charlotte leaves, reluctantly, and goes downstairs.

                         CUT TO
          Later; The sound of the front door closing. Elizabeth
          sits down, heavily, on the bed. She walks downstairs and
          enters the drawing room.

          75 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 75

          Elizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on
          the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and
          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment
          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at
          each other without speaking. Finally...

                         DARCY
          I came to leave you this.
          He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
          does not turn but watches him through the mirror.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to renew the sentiments
          which were so disgusting to you, but to
          address the two offenses you have laid
          against me. I had not long been in
          Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley

                         Â€¢
          preferred your eldest sister. I observed
          my friend's behaviour attentively and I
          could perceive that his partiality for
          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
          witnessed in him.
          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          Yet when I observed your sister .1
          detected no symptom of peculiar regard,
          and witnessed only the families coarse
          appetite for having their daughters
          married favorably. And so in London,
          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
          the unfitness of the match citing your
          sisters coolness towards him.
          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          It was unknowingly done and though the
          motives which governed me may to you
          appear naturally insufficient, they were
          done to protect a friend. As to the other
          â€¢ more serious matter..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          As Elizabeth turns she realises Darcy has gone. Darcy's
          voice carries.

          DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          "My father provided for Mr Wickham a
          valuable living.
          Elizabeth tears open the envelope, her hands shaking, and
          reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on.

          DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          "But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham
          told me that he had no intention of
          taking orders and would I recompense him
          to the tune of Â£3000 so he could go to
          town and study the law.
          We circle Elizabeth as she reads.

          DARCY (CONT'D) (V.0.)

                         (CONT'D)
          This I did, though by now I had some
          doubts about his character. These were
          confirmed by reports that he had sunk
          into a life of idleness, gambling and
          dissipation. The money was soon used up,
          whereupon he wrote demanding more money
          which I refused, whereupon he severed all

                         Â€¢ ACQUAINTANCE"
          Holding the letter she looks out of the window to see
          Darcy riding away.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          "But last summer he was unwillingly
          obtruded on my notice when he connived a
          relationship with my sister whom he
          persuaded to be in love with him and made
          her consent to an elopement. She was but
          fifteen.

          Darcy rides off.

          DARCY (V.0.)
          Mr Wickham's prime objective was her
          inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but
          hope of revenging me was a strong
          inducement. I was lucky enough to
          persuade my sister of her folly. I hope
          this goes someway to mitigating my
          behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my
          word please have it confirmed by my

          Lizzy: Are you alright?

                         ELIZABETH
          I do not know. I hardly know myself.
          Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.

          Elizabeth riding in a carriage through Cheapside, reading
          the letter.

          DARCY (V.0.)
          P.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish
          you all happiness in the future.
          Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and
          the bustle of trade. There is no horizon.
          is 79 INT. GARDINERS HOUSE - CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 7
          Mrs Gardiner, the girls' kindly aunt, is taking
          Elizabeth's coat from her.

                         MRS GARDINER
          How fortunate, you are here just in time
          to catch everybody coming through from
          Longbourn.

                         ELIZABETH
          How is Jane?
          Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.

                         MRS GARDINER
          She is outside.
          Through a window Elizabeth sees Jane sitting quietly
          alone at her needle work.

                         CUT TO:

          80 EXT. SMALL BACK GARDEN OF THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - E


          CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME.
          Elizabeth and Jane sit together in the small walled
          garden.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Jane is all smiles, but behind her eyes is a sadness
          unseen before. Elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself
          â€¢ but feels unable.

                         JANE
          I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed
          in the street I would hardly notice.
          London is so diverting...

                         ELIZABETH
          oh Jane...

                         JANE
          Its true! What with the theatre and...
          But tell me, what news from Kent?

                         ELIZABETH
          Nothing. Everything as you might imagine.
          Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the
          Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the
          garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and
          Mrs Bennet.

                         KITTY

          Kitty, what's happened?

                         LYDIA
          - because she likes me better.

                         KITTY
          I've just as much right as Lydia -

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -

                         KITTY
          - and more so, because I'm two years
          older!
          Elizabeth looks to Jane.

                         JANE
          Lydia has been invited to Brighton with
          the Foresters.

          I shall dine with the officers every

          An anguished wail from Kitty.

                         MRS BENNET
          I'm sure I cried for two days when
          Colonel Millar's regiment went away.
          thought I should have broke my heart.

                         LIZZIE
          Mother! Are you all mad?
          She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by
          everything.

          81 INT. THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - DAY. 81

          Elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please Papa, don't let her go!

                         MR BENNET
          Lydia will never be easy till she has
          exposed herself in some public place or
          other, and we can never expect her to do
          it with so little inconvenience as under
          the present circumstances.

                         ELIZABETH
          (with great emotion)
          If you, dear father, will not take the
          trouble to check her, she will be fixed
          forever as the silliest and most
          determined flirt who ever made her family
          ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she
          always does.

                         MR KENNET
          We shall have no peace until she goes.

                         ELIZABETH
          (really angry now)
          Peace! Is that all you care about?

                         MR BENNET
          Colonel Forster is a sensible man and
          will keep her out of any real mischief,
          and she is far too poor to be an object
          of prey to anyone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         ELIZABETH
          Father, its dangerous! -

                         MR BENNET
          I'm sure the officers will find women
          better worth their while. Let us hope, in
          fact, that her stay in Brighton will
          teach her her own insignificance. At any
          rate she can hardly grow any worse,
          without authorizing us to lock her up for
          the rest of her life.
          Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him?
          He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now,
          she hates him.

                         ELIZABETH
          No wonder our family is treated with
          contempt.
          She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks
          puzzled at her outburst.

          82 INT. DRAWING ROOM - CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. 82

          Mr Bennet follows Elizabeth in.

                         MR BENNET
          Well, at least the house will be quieter.

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't wish to be stuck with such a
          foolish family any longer, with your
          constant talk of men and marriages.
          Surely there is more to life.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to
          accompany us?

                         MR GARDINER
          Oh yes. We plan to journey through the
          Peak District. You'd be most welcome.

                         MARY
          Oh, the glories of nature! What are men,
          compared to rocks and mountains?

                         ELIZABETH
          Believe me, men are either eaten up with
          arrogance or stupidity. And if they're
          amiable they're so easily led that they
          have no minds of their own whatsoever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Take care, my love, that savours strongly
          of bitterness.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, they bring nothing but heartache.

          83 INT. BEDROOM - CHEAPSIDE - NIGHT. 83

          As usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to
          each other in the darkness

                         ELIZABETH
          I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.

                         JANE
          Why did you not tell me. Did he mention
          Mr Bingley.
          Pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          No. He did not.
          Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her
          sister.

                         Â€¢

          84 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY. 84

          A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -
          scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.
          Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she
          nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are
          below making their way towards her. They smile at her.
          She strides off determined to reach the very top. When
          she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her
          head back laughing into the wind. The view is
          magnificent. She breathes deeply.

          85 EXT. LAMBTON - DUSK. 85

          An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town.
          Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and
          Mrs Gardiner at a table.

          86 INT. INN - LAMBTON - NIGHT. 86


                         O
          In the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating
          supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table,
          another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into
          their food.

                         Â€¢

          He's been taking the waters at Buxton.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Hasn't done him a jot of good.

                         HER HUSBAND
          But we've had a fine time, haven't we
          dear?

                         WOMAN
          We've visited Chatsworth, Dovedale,

                         PEMBERLEY -

                         MRS GARDINER
          Pemberley?

                         WOMAN
          Just two miles from here.
          close, very close, on Lizzie's face.

                         HER HUSBAND
          One of the best houses in the country.

                         MR GARDINER

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Aren't you acquainted with the owner, Mr
          â€¢ Darcy?

                         MRS GARDINER
          Well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.

                         ELIZABETH
          I would rather stay here.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Stay here?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (VERY UNCOMFORTABLE)
          I must own that I'm tired of great
          houses. All those carpets and curtains.

                         MRS GARDINER
          But you liked Chatsworth.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am
          sure I will not be able to bear it.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Come, come, Lizzie.

                         WOMAN

                         Â€¢
          The grounds alone are worth a visit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         MR GARDINER
          Let us not make a fuss. If the girl does
          not want to go there is little point in
          persuading her.

          87 INT. BEDROOM -- INN - NIGHT. 87

          Elizabeth is preparing for bed. The chambermaid fills her
          washbowl and starts to leave.

                         ELIZABETH
          I hear that Pemberley is not far from
          here.

                         MAID
          Yes, madam.

                         ELIZABETH
          You see something of the owner, do you,
          in town?

                         MAID
          Not for some months, madam, for he's
          still in London, I believe.
          A pause. Close on Elizabeth's face.

                         Â€¢
          88 EXT. PEMBERLEY - DAY. 8n
          The carriage enters the gates of Pemberley.

                         MRS GARDINER
          I'm so glad you changed your mind.
          Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The
          parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in
          the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the
          carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on
          Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
          A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,
          breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn
          park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in
          the sunlight.

          89 EXT. PARK - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 89

          Elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Imagine being mistress of all this. It is
          as big as all Cheapside.
          Elizabeth is lost in admiration.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          90 INT. PEMBERLY - DAY. 90

          Elizabeth and the Gardiners are being taken on the tour
          by the housekeeper, Mrs Reynolds, who witters on in the
          background with descriptions of each room. Elizabeth is
          apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point
          of view. A book lies open, on a reading desk, Elizabeth
          turns it over to read the title.

                         MRS GARDINER

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Keep up.
          They walk through room after amazing room: a breath-
          taking library, an unbelievable staircase.

          91 INT. PICTURE GALLERY - PEMBERLY -- DAY. 91

          The huge picture gallery. Elizabeth is apart from the
          rest looking at the pictures she stops by a painting of
          Darcy. She looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by
          Mrs Reynolds and the Gardiners who are following her.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          This is my master - Mr Darcy.

                         MRS GARDINER
          A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true
          likeness of him?

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Does this young lady know Mr Darcy?

                         ELIZABETH
          Only a little.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          And do you not think him a handsome man,
          Miss?

                         ELISABETH

                         (THOUGHTFULLY)
          Yes, yes I suppose he is.
          Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting,
          but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          And this is his sister, Miss Georgians.
          She plays and sings all day long.
          We realize that in the distance we have heard music.
          Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then
          suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes Mrs

                         REYNOLDS SPEECH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ They are at home?!

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Miss Darcy is always down for the summer.
          Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow.

                         MR GARDINER
          Is your master much at Pemberley?

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he --
          for he dearly loves it here.
          Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk
          to Mrs Reynolds.

                         MRS GARDINER
          If he should marry, you might see more of
          him.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Yes madam, but I do not know when that
          will be. I do not know a lady who is good
          enough for him.

                         MRS GARDINER
          What do you mean?

                         Â€¢

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
          He was always a kind and generous person
          even then. Not everyone can see it,
          because he does not make a meal of it
          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-
          hearted man I have ever known.

                         CUT TO:
          As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts
          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
          louder.

          92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92

          Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
          â€¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
          is outside the room where the music is being played.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
          better of her and she discretely peeps in.

                         Â€¢
          Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
          It is Darcy.
          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet!
          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
          up with her. They both blush, deeply.

                         ELIZABETH
          I thought you were in London.

                         DARCY

                         (STUPIDLY)
          No... I'm not.

                         ELIZABETH
          No.
          Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.

                         DARCY ELIZABETH
          I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come -

                         DARCY ELIZABETH
          -- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry -

                         STEWARD -
          They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and
          aunt.

                         DARCY
          (trying to recover)
          And are you having a pleasant trip?

                         ELIZABETH
          Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         DARCY
          â€¢ Tomorrow?

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Are you staying at Larnbton?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes. At the Rose and Crown.
          Another pause. She extends her hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the
          house was open for visitors. I had no
          idea...
          She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.

                         DARCY
          May I see you to the village?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.

                         DARCY
          Yes.

                         ELIZABETH
          Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

                         Â€¢
          She hurries away. He gazes after her.

                         CUT TO:
          A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a
          log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.

          93 INT. INN -- NIGHT. 93

          It's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And
          stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she
          sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle.

                         DARCY
          - I shall send my carriage at noon
          After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the
          table.

                         0 MRS GARDINER
          Lizzie, I've just met Mr Darcy! Why
          didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's
          asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He
          was very civil, was he not?

                         Â€¢

                         MR GARDINER
          Very civil.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         MRS GARDINER
          â€¢ Not at all like you painted him.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          To dine with him?

                         MRS GARDINER
          - there is something pleasing about his
          mouth, when he speaks.

                         MR GARDINER
          You don't mind delaying our journey for
          another day?
          Elizabeth shakes her head, dumbly.

                         MRS GARDINER
          He particularly wishes you to meet his
          sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          His sister?

          94 INT. LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOM -- PEMBERLEY - DAY. 94

          A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.
          She jumps up and hurries over.

                         DARCY
          My sister, Miss Darcy...
          They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.

                         GEORGIANA
          Miss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so
          much about you. I feel as if we are
          friends already.

                         ELIZABETH
          What a beautiful instrument.

                         GEORGIANA
          My brother gave it to me.
          (smiles at him)
          He shouldn't have.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         DARCY
          â€¢ Yes I should.

                         GEORGIANA
          Oh very well then.

                         DARCY
          She's easily persuaded, is she not?
          They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley
          approaches.

                         MISS BINGLEY

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          What a surprise, Miss Bennet, to see you
          in Derbyshire.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMALL NOD)
          Your brother is well, I trust?

                         MISS BINGLEY
          Very well. He hopes to come here soon.
          (significant glance at

                         GEORGIANA)
          Pemberley has a special attraction for
          him.

                         Â€¢ ELIZABETH

                         (SWEETLY)
          Yes, the library is particularly
          splendid, is it not?
          A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation,
          approaches.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          And how is your family, Miss Bennet?
          Someone told me the militia are removed
          from Meryton.

                         (SIGNIFICANT SMILE)
          They must be a great loss for some of you
          Darcy comes to the rescue.

                         DARCY
          Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, very.

                         DARCY
          (drawing her away)
          Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this
          afternoon?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          For the lake here is very well stocked
          and its occupants left in peace for far
          â€¢ too long.
          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful
          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
          closer to Darcy.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          In six months I have never seen anyone so
          altered. How brown and coarse she has
          become!

                         DARCY
          I perceive no alteration' except she is
          rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
          consequence of travelling in the summer.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          I remember, when we first knew her in
          Hertfordshire, you said "she a beauty? I
          would have as soon called her mother a
          wit!"

                         DARCY
          You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even
          had I thought it, I would have couched it

                         Â€¢
          with a little more finesse.
          Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each
          other.

          95 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DUSK 95

          Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to
          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is so beautiful up here. I will be
          sorry to leave.
          Darcy smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH
          You have been a most gracious host. I'm
          sure my aunt and uncle will talk of
          nothing else for days.

                         Â€¢ DARCY
          I have recently thought a great deal
          about how I appear and act to others.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          She smiles softly at Darcy.

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          It does you credit, sir.

          96 INT. INN -- LAMBTON - NIGHT. 96

          The party arrive back at the inn.

                         MR GARDINER
          (quietly to Elizabeth)
          What a capital fellow.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Thank you so much Mr Darcy.
          Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings
          Elizabeth a letter.

                         SERVANT

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          For you, madam.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (DELIGHTED)
          107 Its from Jane. 10
          â€¢ she rips open the letter.

          97 INT. PARLOUR - INN - LAMBTON - THE SAME. 97

          Elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand.
          Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite
          knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts
          into tears again. She cries for a long time.

                         DARCY
          Miss Elizabeth.
          She cries on.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          Miss Elizabeth.
          She eventually gathers herself.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has
          run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone
          together from Brighton to Lord knows
          where. She has no money, no connections,
          I fear she is lost forever.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         DARCY
          â€¢ (quietly to Elizabeth)
          This is my fault - if only I had exposed
          Wickham when I should.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, this is my fault. I might have
          prevented all of it by merely being open
          with my sisters rather than too proud
          with my knowledge.
          Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Has anything been done to recover her?

                         ELIZABETH
          Father has gone to London. But I know
          very well that nothing can be done. We
          have not the smallest hope.

                         DARCY
          Would to heaven that anything could be
          said or done on my part that could offer
          consolation to such distress.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir, it think it is too late.

                         Â€¢

                         MR GARDINER
          I am afraid we must go at once - I will
          join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she
          ruins the family forever.

                         DARCY
          I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed.
          I will leave you. Goodbye.
          Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and
          then is gone.

          98 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT. 98

          The Gardiner's carriage racing through the night.

          99 INT. LONGBOURN - MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - DAY. 99

          Elizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs
          Bennet who has taken to her bed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Why did the Foresters let her out of
          their sight? I always said they were
          unfit to have charge of her.

          And now she is ruined.

                         MRS BENNET
          You are all ruined. Who will take you now
          with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will
          now have to fight the perfidious Wickham
          and then be killed...

                         ELIZABETH
          He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

                         MRS BENNET
          - and The Collins' will turn us out
          before he is cold in his grave -

                         JANE
          Do not be alarmed, mama. Our uncle is
          helping in the search.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lydia must know what this will do to my
          nerves, such flutterings and spasms all
          over me...

                         Â€¢
          Were looking directly down onto a London street. Mr
          Bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian
          traffic. He tries to address a passer by.

                         MR BENNET
          Excuse me.
          They ignore him. He tries again

          MR BENNET (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, I'm looking for...
          Mr Bennet takes out a piece of paper.

          101 INT. MESS HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT. 101

          Mr Bennet walks timidly into the mess hall. It is smoky,
          drunken, noisy, boisterous and extremely threatening. Mr
          Bennet stops at the threshold, gulps, then the whole room
          turns round to look at him and a sudden silence descends.
          Mr Bennet is terrified.

                         MR BENNET
           I am...(his voice breaks up - he clears
           his throat) I am looking for a Mr

          Elizabeth and Jane are outside Mrs Bennet's room. From
          inside we hear a moan.

          MRS BENNET (OFF)
          We are ruined. Ruined.

                         ELIZABETH
          How long is this going to go on for?

                         JANE
          Don't be too harsh. This is hard for all
          of us.
          They walk downstairs.

          103 INT. DOWNSTAIRS - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 103

          Elizabeth and Jane walk into the drawing room. Kitty and
          Mary are busying themselves.

                         ELIZABETH

                         KITTY
          - who is to fight Wickham and make him

          Elizabeth pulls off his boots for him.

                         MR BENNET
          â€¢ It's been my own doing.

                         ELIZABETH
          You mustn't be too severe on yourself.

                         MR BENNET
          No Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel
          how much I have been to blame.

                         (WAN SMILE)
          I am not afraid of being overpowered by
          the experience. It will pass away soon
          enough.

          105 EXT/INT. BOARDING HOUSE - LONDON - DAY. 105

          We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a
          seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens
          boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the
          exterior wall of the building to find an open window
          through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.
          Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in
          their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a
          meal with relish. Giggling, Lydia feeds him a mouthful.
          A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.

                         Â€¢

          106 EXT. GARDEN - LONGBOURN - DAY. 106

          The girls have a letter. Kitty grabs it from Jane, Mary
          grabs it from Kitty, before she has a chance to open it
          Jane grabs it from Mary.

                         JANE
          It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing.
          Mr Bennet snatches the letter.

                         MR BENNET
          As it is addressed to me...
          He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he
          has forgotten his glasses.

          MR BENNET (CONT'D)
          He's found them.

                         KITTY
          Are they married?

                         MR BENNET
          (squinting at the letter)
          Just wait. I can't make out his script.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Elizabeth snatches it.

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          Give it to me. (she reads)

                         KITTY
          Are they married?

                         ELIZABETH
          They will be, if father will settle a
          hundred pounds a year on her. That is
          Wickham's condition.

                         KITTY
          A hundred pounds!

                         ELIZABETH
          You will agree to this, father?
          The letter is passed around the other girls.

                         MR BENNET
          Of course I will agree. But how much your
          uncle has laid on this wretched man
          already is anybody's guess.

                         KITTY
          What do you mean, Father?

                         Â€¢

                         MR BENNET
          No man in his senses would marry Lydia on
          so slight a temptation as a hundred a
          year.

                         ELIZABETH
          Ah, I see.

                         JANE
          See what?

                         MR BENNET
          Your uncle is very generous.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think it a large sum?

                         MR BENNET
          Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less
          than ten thousand pounds. I should be
          sorry to think so ill of him in the very -
          beginning of our relationship.

                         JANE
          Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!

          â€¢ 107 INT. MR & MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. It
          Close on Mrs Bennet's face as she springs out of bed.
          Pure triumphant joy.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring
          the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things
          and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face!
          And tell the servants they will have a
          bowl of punch!
          The other Bennet's are assembled.

                         ELIZABETH
          We should thank our uncle, Mama.

                         MRS BENNET
          And so he should help! He's much richer
          than us, and he hasn't got any children.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ANGRILY)
          How can you talk like that?
          Her mother gets to her feet.

                         Â€¢

                         MRS BENNET
          A daughter, married!

                         ELIZABETH
          Is that all you think about?

                         MRS BENNET
          "Mrs Wickham" - how well it sounds

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IN DESPERATION)
          You don't know what he's like

                         MRS BENNET
          Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge
          might do. Ashworth is vacant of course,
          but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to
          have her ten miles from me -

                         MR BENNET
          Before you take any of these houses, Mrs
          Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house
          she will never be welcome.
          Mrs Bennet stares at him.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          â€¢ 108 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 108

          Lydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream.
          She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses
          her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows.

                         LYDIA
          - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her
          carriage so I took off my glove and let
          my hand just rest on the window frame, so
          she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed
          and smiled like anything!
          Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot
          bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him.

          109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109

          They are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to
          the head of the table.

                         LYDIA
          Jane, I take your place now, and you must
          go lower, for I am the married woman.
          She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings
          â€¢ in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring
          to the maid.

                         LYDIA
          You must all go to Brighton, for that is
          the place to get husbands! I hope you
          have half my good luck.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FURIOUS)
          Lydia!

                         CUT TO:
          Wickham looking uncomfortable. He's talking to the stony-
          faced Mr Bennet.

                         WICKHAM
          I've been enlisted in a regiment in the
          north of England, sir.
          l f G MR BENNET

                         (NODS COLDLY)
          I'm glad to hear of it.

                         WICKHAM
          Near Newcastle. We shall travel there
          next week.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         KITTY
          â€¢ Can I come and stay with you?

                         MR BENNET
          That is out. of the question.

                         CUT TO:
          Lydia, rattling on to Lizzie.

                         LYDIA
          Well, Monday morning came and I was in
          such a fuss -

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't want to hear -

                         LYDIA
          - there was my aunt, preaching and
          talking away just as if she was reading a
          sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -

                         ELIZABETH
          Can't you understand why?

                         LYDIA
          - but I didn't hear a word because I was
          thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to
          â€¢ know whether he would be married in his
          blue coat...

                         CUT TO:
          Mary turning to Wickham.

                         MARY
          The north of England, I believe, boasts
          some spectacular scenery...

                         CUT TO:
          Lydia burbling on, to a stony-faced Lizzie.

                         LYDIA
          - and then my uncle was called away from
          the church on business and I thought -
          who is to be our best man if he doesn't
          come back? Lucky he did come back or I
          would have had to ask Mr Darcy -

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          Mr Darcy?

                         LYDIA
          (claps her hand to her mouth)
          I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         Â€¢ ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

                         LYDIA

                         (WHISPERS)
          He was the one that discovered us! He
          knew where to find Wickham, you see.

                         (HISSES)
          But don't tell anyone! He told me not to
          tell!
          Lizzie stares at her. Darcy at her wedding? Lydia turns
          away, to talk to the others.

          110 EXT. GARDEN - LONGBOURN - DAY. 110

          Lydia, croquet mallet in hand, drags her new husband
          across the lawn. Kitty follows.

                         LYDIA
          Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.

                         KITTY
          Yes, come on!
          Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has
          he let himself in for?
          Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger
          sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A
          rueful smile.

                         WICKHAM
          I hope we can be even better friends, now
          we're brother and sister.
          An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now
          immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.

                         WICKHAM
          I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old
          home.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (NODS)
          I met Mr Darcy's sister.

                         WICKHAM

                         (A BEAT)
          Did you like her?

                         ELIZABETH
          Very much.
          (looks at him)
          We found a great deal to talk about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          A beat. Wickham looks deeply uneasy. He bows and leaves.
          Lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn.
          She can't bear it; she hurries up to Lydia and draws her
          aside.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (LOW VOICE)
          Why was Mr Darcy there?

                         LYDIA
          I'm not supposed to tell.
          Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, Lydia!

                         LYDIA
          Because he paid for it.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          For what?

                         LYDIA

                         (CARELESSLY)
          The wedding, Wickham's commission.
          Everything.

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          Everything?

                         KITTY

                         (CALLS)
          Lydia! It's your turn!
          Lydia moves to go.

                         LYDIA
          People kept saying Wickham owed them
          money, it was so tedious. So Darcy
          settled his debts but I don't really like
          him, do you?
          Lizzie pulls her back.

                         ELIZABETH
          But why did he do it?

                         LYDIA

                         (SHRUGS)
          I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to
          tell because it's supposed to be our
          uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have
          â€¢ minded paying, either, because I'm his
          favorite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          â€¢ She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn.
          Elizabeth looks blank with shock.

          111 EXT. BINGLEY'S HOUSE - MAYFAIR -- DAY. 111

          Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we
          see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He
          arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door
          is opened.

                         BUTLER
          Mr Darcy.

                         DARCY
          I have some business with Mr Bingley.
          Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
          slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
          looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We
          witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has
          wronged Jane Bennet.

          112 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 112


                         IS
          Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a
          distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the
          carriage.

                         MRS BENNET
          Write to me often, my dear'.
          Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.

                         WICKHAM
          Please relay my affections to the Darcy's
          on your next acquaintance. I am sure he
          will be pleased to hear things have
          worked out so well.
          He joins Lydia.

                         LYDIA
          (through the window)
          Married women never have much time for
          writing. My sisters may write to me!
          They'll have nothing else to do.
          The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives
          away.

          Oh there is nothing so bad as parting
          with ones children! One seems so forlorn
          without them.

                         ELIZABETH
          That is the consequence of marrying a
          daughter. It must make you better
          satisfied that your other four are
          single.

          113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113

          Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and
          sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the
          butchers shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley
          is returning to Netherfield.
          A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley?
          Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,
          for she expects him tomorrow.

                         MRS BENNET
          Tomorrow?

                         (RECOVERING)
          Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is
          nothing to us and I'm sure I never want
          to see him again.

                         (MOVES AWAY)
          No, we shall not mention a word about it.
          (comes back to Mrs Hill)
          Is it quite certain he is coming?

                         MRS HILL
          Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his
          sister remains in town.

                         MRS BENNET
          Huh! Come along, girls.
          Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at
          the threshold.

                         0

                         JANE

                         Â€¢
          It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad
          that he comes alone, because then we
          shall see less of him.

                         (BLUSHING)
          Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
          dread other people's remarks.
          A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
          slightest. They go into the shop.

          114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114

          Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight
          trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding
          along side him. They cross the moat bridge.

          115 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 115

          Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are
          sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes
          in.

                         KITTY
          He is here! He is here, he's at the door!

                         Â€¢

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally.
          Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a
          fluster.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Whatever you do, do not appear
          overbearing.
          Kitty looks out through a window.

                         KITTY
          Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats
          his name. The pompous one from before.
          Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart
          leaps to her mouth.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of
          0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?
          Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs
          Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.

                         Â€¢ JANE
          Mama!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         MRS BENNET
          â€¢ (to Mary - who is still

                         PLAYING)
          Stop that and sit down! Find yourself
          some work! Oh Lord.
          They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing
          room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They
          bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.
          Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs
          Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          How very glad we are to see you, Mr
          Bingley! There are a great many changes
          since you went away. Miss Lucas is
          married and settled. And one of my own
          daughters too, you will have seen it in
          the papers though it was not put in as it
          ought to have been. Very short, nothing
          about her family.

                         BINGLEY

                         (SMILES)
          I did hear of it, and offer my
          congratulations.

                         MRS BENNET
          - but it's very hard to have my Lydia
          taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been
          transferred to Newcastle, where ever that
          is. Thank heaven he has some friends.
          Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is
          more than Elizabeth can bare.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you hope to stay long in the country,
          Mr Bingley?

                         BINGLEY
          Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

                         MRS BENNET
          When you have killed all your own birds,
          Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and
          shoot as many as you please.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Thank you -

                         MRS BENNET
          - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to
          oblige you, and will save all the best of
          â€¢ the covies for you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107,

                         MR BINGLEY

                         Â€¢
          Excellent.

                         ELIZABETH
          Are you well, Mr Darcy?

                         DARCY
          Quite well, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for
          your sport.

                         DARCY
          I return to town tomorrow.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (A PAUSE)
          So soon?

                         MRS BENNET
          My Jane looks well, does she not?
          Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.

                         BINGLEY
          She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I
          suppose. Darcy -
          Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh
          stare, Bingley has not completed his task.

          BINGLEY (CONT`D)
          It was very pleasant to see you all
          again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..
          Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he
          acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the
          door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.

                         MRS BENNET
          You must come again. For when you were in
          town last winter you promised to take a
          family dinner with us. I have not forgot
          you see. At least three courses.
          Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets
          sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is
          fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified
          by the awkward visit.

          116 EXT. THE LANE - NEAR LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 116

          â€¢ Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair
          muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme
          frustration.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         BINGLEY
          Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.

                         DARCY
          What were you thinking of?
          It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and
          down.

                         BINGLEY
          Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.

          117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117

          The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in.
          despair.

                         JANE
          Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now
          meet as indifferent acquaintances.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (LAUGHING)
          Oh yes? Jane, take care.

                         JANE
          You cannot think me so weak as to be in

                         Â€¢
          danger now.

                         ELIZABETH
          I think you are in great danger of making
          him as much in love with you as ever.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr
          Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (BLURTS OUT)
          Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I
          been in love, I could not have been more
          blind!

                         JANE

                         (STARES)
          What do you mean?
          The door bell rings.

                         KITTY
          (at the window)
          It is him. He's back. He's come again.
          â€¢ A stunned reaction.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear

                         Â€¢
          Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very
          awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with
          embarrassment.

                         BINGLEY
          I, erm, I know this is all very
          embarrassing, but I would like to request
          the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane -
          They all look at him.

                         BINGLEY (CONT'D)
          - alone.

                         MRS BENNET
          Girls. Everybody to the kitchen.
          Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so
          good to see you again so soon.
          She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's
          hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other
          with extreme embarrassment.

                         BINGLEY
          Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of
          a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say,
          I have been an unmitigated and
          comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would
          like to ask you -

                         CUT TO:

          118 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 118

          Mrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling
          for a position at the door in order to overhear events
          inside.

                         MARY
          Ssssshhh!
          Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be
          there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house
          into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one
          knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the
          house.

          - CUT TO:

          119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119

          â€¢ Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         JANE
          â€¢ Yes. A hundred times - yes.
          Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to
          the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane
          beam at them.

                         MRS BENNET
          Thank the Lord for that. I thought it
          would never happen.

          120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120

          Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying.

          121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121

          Darcy looks down at Longbourn.

          122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122

          Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed.

                         MR BENNET
          I am sure they will do well together,

                         Â€¢
          their tempers are much alike. They will
          be cheated assiduously by their servants,
          and be so generous with the rest, they
          will always exceed their income.

                         MRS BENNET
          Exceed their income? He has five thousand
          a year! I knew she could not be so
          beautiful for nothing.
          The camera moves through to another bedroom - where Mary
          is reading a book out loud to Kitty - then to yet another

                         ROOM:

          123 INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 123

          Jane and Elizabeth lie in bed.

                         JANE
          He has made me so happy. You know, he. was
          totally ignorant of my being in town last
          spring!

                         ELIZABETH
          How did he account for it?

                         Â€¢

                         JANE
          He thought me indifferent!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          Unfathomable.

                         JANE
          No doubt poisoned by his pernicious
          sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          Bravo! That is the most unforgiving
          speech you've ever made.

                         JANE
          Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so
          happy. If there were such another man for
          you!
          There is a noise outside.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may
          meet with another Mr Collins in time.
          What is that?
          More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud
          banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each
          other.

          124 INT. DOWNSTAIRS -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 12.4-

          Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles
          have gathered. The door bangs again.

                         MARY
          Maybe he's changed his mind.
          Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps.

                         ELIZABETH
          Lady Catherine!
          Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in
          uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast
          Bennets.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          (to Mrs Bennet)
          And these are your daughters, I suppose.

                         MRS BENNET
          All but one, the youngest has been lately
          married your ladyship. And my eldest was
          only proposed to yesterday afternoon.

                         Â€¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You have a very small garden, madam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         MRS BENNET
          â€¢ I am sure it is nothing compared to
          Rosings, but it is larger than Sir
          William Lucas's, I can assure you.

                         MR BENNET

                         (TENTATIVELY)
          Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss
          Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete
          urgency.
          The Bennets all look at each other", bewildered by this
          strange turn of events.

          125 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 125

          Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an
          oil lamp. Lady Catherine walks in. The door closes behind
          them.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to
          understand why I am`here.
          â€¢ Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a
          flickering ghoul.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed you are mistaken. I can not
          account for this honour at all.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be
          trifled with. A report of a most alarming
          nature has reached me that you intend to
          be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.
          Elizabeth stares at her, amazed.

          LADY CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,
          though not wishing to injure him by
          supposing it possible, I instantly set
          off to make my sentiments known.

                         ELIZABETH
          If you believed it impossible, I wonder
          you took the trouble of coming so far.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (COOLLY)
          Your coming here will be rather a
          confirmation, surely, if indeed such a
          report exists.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of
          it? Has it not been industriously
          circulated by yourself?

                         ELIZABETH
          I have never heard of it.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          And can you declare there is no
          foundation for it?

                         ELIZABETH
          I do not pretend to possess equal
          frankness with your ladyship. You may ask
          the questions, which I may not choose to
          answer.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          This is not to be borne. Has my nephew
          made you an offer of marriage?

                         IS

                         ELIZABETH
          Your Ladyship declared it to be
          impossible.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged
          to my daughter. Now what have you to say?

                         ELIZABETH
          Only this - if that is the case you can
          have no reason to suppose he will make an
          offer to me.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Oh obstinate girl! This union has been
          planned since their infancy. Do you think
          it can be prevented by a young woman of
          inferior birth, of no importance in the
          world and wholly unallied to his family?
          Whose own sister's elopement resulted in
          the scandalously patched-up marriage,
          only achieved at the expense of your
          uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades
          of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell
          me once and for all, are you engaged to
          him?

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          I am not.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          And will you promise never to enter into
          such an engagement?

                         ELIZABETH
          I will not. And I certainly never shall.
          Allow me to say, the arguments which you
          have supported this extraordinary
          application have been as frivolous as the
          application was ill-judged. You have,
          insulted me in every possible method and
          can now have nothing further to say. I
          must ask you to leave immediately. Good
          night.
          Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family
          outside.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          I have never been thus treated in my
          entire life.
          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the
          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement
          of having stood so firmly up for herself.

                         MR BENNET
          Lizzie, what on earth is going on?

                         Â€¢

                         ELIZABETH
          Just a small misunderstanding.
          She walks past them to bed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lizzie!

                         ELIZABETH
          For once in your life. Just leave me
          alone.
          Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.

          126 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 126

          Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She
          quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.

          127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127

          Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see
          dawn is breaking.

          128 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAWN. 128

          Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around
          through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to
          rise.

          129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129

          Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists
          are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the
          distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She
          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy!

                         DARCY
          What are you doing out here so early?

                         ELIZABETH
          I could not sleep.

                         DARCY
          Me neither. I have been up.most of the
          night.

                         Â€¢
          Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
          meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
          I know what kindnesses you have done for
          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
          happy resolution for Jane also.

                         DARCY
          I am alarmed that you know of what I have
          been so in earnest to keep silent. But
          you must know that your happiness was one
          of my prime inducements.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy.

          DARCY (CONT`D)
          I know you are too generous to trifle
          with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
          last night, and it has taught me to hope
          as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
          If your feelings are still what they were
          last April, tell me so at once. My
          affections and wishes are unchanged, but

                         Â€¢
          one word from you will silence me
          forever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.
          Elizabeth is silent.

                         0

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          If, however, your feelings have
          changed...
          Elizabeth gazes at him.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          I would have to tell you, you have
          bewitched me body and soul and I love and
          love and love you. And never wish to be
          parted from you from this day on.
          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
          cheek.

                         ELIZABETH
          I am very happy to inform you that not
          only have my sentiments changed there are
          no other words which could give me
          greater pleasure.
          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
          kiss becomes passionate.

          130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130

          The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr
          and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about
          Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see
          Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across
          the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lizzie, where have you been. We thought
          something had happened to you.
          Darcy follows Elizabeth in.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing
          here?
          Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa.
          Everyone is stunned.

          Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting.
          After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the
          briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth
          walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.

                         MR BENNET
          Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I
          thought you hated the man.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, Papa.

                         MR BENNET
          He is rich, to be sure, and you will have
          more fine carriages than Jane. But will
          that make you happy?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Have you no other objection than your
          belief in my indifference?

                         MR BENNET
          None at all. We all know him to be a
          proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but
          this would be nothing if you really liked
          him.

                         ELIZABETH
          (tears in her eyes)
          I do like him!

                         (WITH PASSION)
          I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's
          been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...
          You don't know him, Papa...if I told you
          what he's really like. What he's done.

                         MR BENNET
          What has he done?

          Good Lord. I must pay him back.

                         ELIZABETH
          (shakes her head)
          No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't
          want it.

                         (PAUSE)
          We misjudged him, me more than anyone. In
          every way,not just in this matter. I've
          been so blind. He's been so blind! About
          Jane, about so many things. Then so have

          I...

                         (BREATHLESS PAUSE)
          You see, he and I are so similiar...we're
          both so stubborn...

                         (SHAKY LAUGH)
          Oh Papa...
          Mr Bennet gazes at his daughter-. He still can't quite
          take it in.

                         MR BENNET
          You do love him, don't you?
          Elizabeth nods.

                         ELIZABETH
          â€¢ Very much.
          He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves
          his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no
          doubt.

                         MR BENNET
          I cannot believe that anyone can deserve
          you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I
          heartily give my consent.
          Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.

                         MR BENNET
          I could not have parted with you, my
          Lizzie, to any one less worthy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh thank you!
          She starts to rush out.

                         MR BENNET
          (calls out after her)
          And if any young men come for Mary or
          Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at
          â€¢ leisure.

          â€¢ 134 EXT. PEMBERLY - NIGHT. 134

          We move through a vast wedding party, following Elizabeth
          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
          are missing. Let everyone have an end.
          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
          Elizabeth and smiles.

                         DARCY
          Allow me, Mrs Darcy.
          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.

                         ELIZABETH
          How did it begin?

                         DARCY
          I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or

                         Â€¢
          the look. It was too long ago and I was
          in the middle before I knew it had begun.

                         ELIZABETH
          Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
          impertinenc?

                         DARCY
          For the liveliness of your mind, I did.

                         ELIZABETH
          You may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for
          teasing and quarrelling with you as often
          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...
          We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and
          smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter
          and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...

          135 FADE TO BLACK... 135

                         Â€¢

          THE END.
