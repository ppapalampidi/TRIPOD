     --------------------------------------------------------------

     INT.  BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT

     Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,
     the congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a
     reservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the
     line.  PAN ahead to...

     ... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant
     service.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
     by far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting
     delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
     person they screen from our view.  We can see, however...

     ... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the
     table.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes,
     an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and
     conservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess
     it.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a
     quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...

     ... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears
     her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
     together in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile,
     scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an
     original beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender
     expressive fingers, which point to...

                    CAPTAIN
              A variation on our squid ink
              risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to
              sweeten the stock.

     She doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of
     doubt that makes him smile.  Murmur...

                    CAPTAIN
              Don't kill us on this one, it's
              a long shot.

     Places the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a
     surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead
     flat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice.
     The Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him.
     The tone says they're pals...

                    JULIANNE
              I'm writing it up as inventive and
              confident.  Which it is.  Off the
              record, I'll need an extra boat of
              the ink.  Or a salt shaker.

                    CAPTAIN
              I'll toss a coin.

     As the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,
     which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away.

                    DIGGER
              Is it ever embarrassing, having
              your bum kissed in public?

                    JULIANNE
              If your ass isn't chapped, you
              are not a good-writer of note.

     She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn
     nearby.

                    JULIANNE
              Is it sad to be an editor, and bask
              only in reflected insincerity?

                    DIGGER
              I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.

     She leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.

                    JULIANNE
              See the pull of a book like
              Twenty Chefs, is not who I
              put in.  It's who I leave out.

                    DIGGER
              Which is everyone you couldn't
              get in.

                    JULIANNE
              Plus some guys whose food I don't
              like.

     Pushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.

                    DIGGER
              This fellow from Newsday ever
              call?

     She shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.

                    JULIANNE
              I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive
              and confident, yeh?

     She dials.  He tastes.

                    DIGGER
              Needs salt.

                    JULIANNE
              Is Newsday a real interview, or
              just some cute guy you're setting
              me up w...

                    DIGGER
              ... I don't send you men, anymore.
              You don't know what to do with them.

     She's punching in her code.

                    JULIANNE
              Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.

                    DIGGER
              ... weeks.

     Over the phone, we hear her answering machine...

                    MAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)
              Hey.  It's Michael.

     And her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              God, it must be, what, months, huh?
              I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm
              in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton...

     She looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Call me four in the morning,
              whatever, we gotta talk.

     As she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has
     never seen that, and he likes it very much.

                    DIGGER
              Who called? The man of the
              moment?

     She smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.
     The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished.

                    JULIANNE
              No, no, the opposite.  That's
              my best friend, Michael O'Neal.
              He sounds desperate to talk.

                    DIGGER
              The wandering sportswriter.

     He pushes the risotto back her way.

                    DIGGER
              I didn't know you two had a
              past.

     Her gaze sharpens.  Hmmn?

                    DIGGER
              The look in your eye.

     She blushes.  Shakes her head, no way.

                    JULIANNE
              Sophomore year at Yale we had
              this one hot month.  And, you
              know me, I got restless...

     He knows her.  She got restless.

                    JULIANNE
              So I get up the nerve to break
              his heart.  I tell him there's
              this dreamy exchange student
              from Pakistan who wants to,
              you know...

     He knows.

                    JULIANNE
              And he gets this... look.  He
              says, "I knew I couldn't hold
              your interest", which, of course,
              makes me feel like the shallow
              bitch I've always been...

     He nods, yeah.

                    JULIANNE
              Then he says, "But what makes
              me want to cry.  Is I'm losing
              the best friend I ever had."

     Hears the feeling.  In her voice.

                    JULIANNE
              And when he said it, I knew.
              I felt the same.

     Silence now.  She covers with a smile.

                    JULIANNE
              So I cried.  For maybe the third
              time in my life.  And I kissed
              him.  And we've been best friends
              ever since.

     Ever since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...

                    JULIANNE
              Nine years, we've seen each other
              through everything.  Losing jobs,
              losing parents, losing lovers...
              travelled all over, we've had the
              best times.  The best times of my
              life, maybe.  Just drinking and
              talking.  Even over a phone.

                    DIGGER
              Kindred spirits.

                    JULIANNE
              No, he's nothing like me.  He's
              like you.  Only straight.

     No offense taken.

                    JULIANNE
              He's the salt of the earth.  Kind
              and loyal and generous.  The one
              constant thing in my life, is he'll
              always be there.

                    DIGGER
              He's still in love with you.

     That stops her.  She has to say...

                    JULIANNE
              Maybe.  But it never gets in
              the way.

     Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger
     understands.

                    DIGGER
              Well, he has a true friend in
              you.

     He wants her to know he sees that.

                    DIGGER
              Whenever George tells someone
              how steadfast I am, he always
              makes me sound boring.

                    JULIANNE
              Solid and genuine is not boring.
              Michael can be completely insane...

     A young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
     plate.

                    JULIANNE
              There was this one night in
              Tucson, like six years ago...
              we got amazingly drunk, I mean,
              Keith Richards time...

     The kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.

                    JULIANNE
              God, I haven't thought of this
              in so long...

     The waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.

                    JULIANNE
              I can even believe we did
              this...

     Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So
     she looks up.

                    JULIANNE
              Could you give us a minute?

     The kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.

                    JULIANNE
              You won't miss much, I promise
              there was no sex.

     He reddens and disappears.

                    DIGGER
              I've lost interest.

                    JULIANNE
              He takes a razor from his dinky
              little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,
              takes my hand, does the same to me...

     She places the tips of her index fingers together.

                    DIGGER
              Blood oath.

                    JULIANNE
              He says, "Swear.  When we're both
              28, if we've never been married...
              we marry each other!"

     And laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling.
     She wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto.

                    JULIANNE
              See, he figured that would be a
              sign from God, or someone of
              comparable authority, that we'd
              misunderstood our destinies.

     He still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.

                    JULIANNE
              We never talked about it again.  I
              don't know what made me think of...

                    DIGGER (quietly)
              I do.

     And everything.  Stops.  She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the
     gravity of his tone.

                    DIGGER
              You'll be 28 in three weeks.
              How old is he?

     Holy.  Fucking.  Shit.  It hits her like a ton of lead bricks.  She
     shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking.

                    JULIANNE
              You think...

                    DIGGER
              Desperate.  To talk.

     She shovels in more drippy black goop.  It is really disgusting.

                    JULIANNE
              He's not proposing marriage,
              there's no way I'm buying one
              word of th...

                    DIGGER
              Then why are you compulsively
              eating? If you're not hysterical?

     More goes in.  Her lips and mouth completely black.  Like a circus
     clown.

                    JULIANNE
              He can't do that to me!

                    DIGGER
              We're about to find out.

     Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
     her face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from
     reaching her sweater.

                    JULIANNE
              When I turn him down...

     She realizes the full weight of the truth.

                    JULIANNE
              We'll never be the same.

                    DIGGER
              I have a suggestion...

                    JULIANNE
              I'll have to kill myself before I
              call him.

     Staring in each other's eyes.

                    DIGGER (sadly)
              That was it.

     INT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.
     Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball
     jersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes
     dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
     the closed toilet lid.

     She spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great.
     Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the
     hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...

     ... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres-
     sively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
     you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing...

                    JULIANNE
              This is awkward timing, Michael,
              I just joined this convent, and
              they never give your deposit ba...

     Stops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her
     best.

                    JULIANNE
              Michael, I'm married.

     Not enough.

                    JULIANNE
              ... and I have two weeks to live.

     Changes tone...

                    JULIANNE
              Michael, I'm trying to be gay,
              don't confuse me.

     She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.
     Stuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the
     number, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects...

                    JULIANNE
              I was calling Michael O'Neal,
              but seeing it's so late, I could
              just leave a mes...

     No such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...

                    JULIANNE (soft)
              Good evening, sir.  You've been
              enrolled in the Obscene Call Of
              The Month Club, and th...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Hey! God, it's so good to hear
              your voice.

     She forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I've been calling for days!

                    JULIANNE
              Yeh, well my old machine kept
              eating messages.  I tried
              constructively ignoring it in
              hopes of improvement, but finally...

                    MICHAEL (V.O., urgent)
              Look, I have to ask you something.

     She swallows.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Something so incredibly important,
              that if you turn me down, I don't
              know what I'll d...

                    JULIANNE (bright)
              I just have to tell you this one
              thing first, okay? I mean this
              will hand you the biggest laugh
              of your adult life...

     Silence.  Come on girl, suck it up.

                    JULIANNE
              I was thinking about you, and I
              remembered this unbelievably insane
              night we spent together in Tucson,
              like a thousand years ago?

     More silence.  Really quiet.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean, there's no way you could
              possibly remember the...

                    MICHAEL (V.O., soft)
              Are you kidding?

     Stops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I think about that night all
              the time.

     She's going to have a heart attack.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              But it's not why I called.

     She blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
     sweep away...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I called because I met someone.

     And her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is
     something in his voice.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, that's great.  You haven't
              really had anybody since Dingbat
              Jennylee...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              You don't understand.  I've never
              felt this way about anybody!

     Never.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              And she's all wrong for me!

                    JULIANNE
              Well, somet...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I mean she's a junior at Chicago
              University, she's twenty years
              old! Like when I first met you.

     Like when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              And her dad is like this billionaire
              who owns the White Sox and some cable
              empire, and you know how I've always
              been miserably awkward around those
              kinda stuffed suits...

     She's finally making her mouth work...

                    JULIANNE
              Well, sure.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              But they're so down to earth, such
              wonderful people...

                    JULIANNE
              You've met her parents.

                    MICHAEL (V.O., quiet)
              Well.  Sure.

     Wow.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              See.  We're getting married.
              This Sunday.

     There's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.

                    JULIANNE
              Michael, it's Wednesday night,
              you can't possibly be getting
              married on Su...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Actually, it all starts tomorrow.
              It's one of those four-day weddings,
              with all the traditional events, and
              ten million people flying in from
              Madagascar such.

                    JULIANNE (incredibly lame)
              Aren't you... working this weekend?
              I mean, is that responsible?

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's
              letting me do a profile on the Big
              Hurt.  That's Frank...

                    JULIANNE
                   (barely audible)
              ... Thomas, yeh.

     She's staring at herself in the mirror.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Jules.  I'm scared.

     A straw to lunge at.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, maybe we should talk ab...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I need you.

     So heartfelt.  A lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              If you can't come.  And hold my
              hand.  I'll never get through this.

     Oh.

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              Please come, please.

                    JULIANNE
              W...

                    MICHAEL (V.O.)
              I can't wait for you to meet her!

     HOLD ON Julianne.  Staring in the mirror.  Like watching the end of
     her life.

     INT.  BEDROOM - LATER

     The closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open.  Two huge
     suitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,
     as she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time.  Over the phone,
     now...

                    DIGGER (V.O., machine)
              You've reached Digger and George.
              Brevity will be appreciated.

     BEEP.

                    JULIANNE (in a rage)
              IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
              UP HAVING SAFE SEX??

     SNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress.  Pouts at it.

                    JULIANNE
              OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, WHY AREN'T
              YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER
              THE PHONE??

     She holds the dress against her body.  It's hot.

                    JULIANNE
              YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT
              YOU, ISN'T IT??

     She clicks OFF.  Checks the dress in the mirror.  Raises the short
     skirt a little higher.

     INT. DIGGER'S CHEROKEE, JFK AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING

     Digger driving the open-air Cherokee up the ramp to United Airlines
     departures.  Julianne, wind-whipped, trying to light a fresh
     cigarette from the butt of the last one.  He glances over.  Hates
     to see this...

                    DIGGER
              You can't get lung cancer and
              die in four days.  Go to Plan B.

     She sucks deep.  Really deep.

                    JULIANNE
              You have no appropriate sense
              of emergency.  My best friend
              is ruining his life.

                    DIGGER
              No, he's ruining yours.

                    JULIANNE
              Same difference.  If you love
              someone, it's your duty to save
              them from themselves.

                    DIGGER
              You have a real philosophy of
              life.

                    JULIANNE
              It's called the Law of Love,
              asshole.

     She is tight enough to snap.  And at the edge of tears.  Staring
     out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the
     curb.

                    DIGGER (gently)
              Why don't we have a drink? You
              could catch a later fl...

                    JULIANNE
              I'm a busy girl.  I've got four
              days to break up a wedding, and
              steal the bride's fella.

     She finally looks at him.  He doesn't say anything.

                    JULIANNE
              He's adored me for nine goddamn
              years.

                    DIGGER
              I can see why.

                    JULIANNE
              She knows him maybe five seconds,
              plus she has billions of dollars,
              plus she's perfect, so don't go
              feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!

     He's not.  So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.

                    JULIANNE
              And don't go feeling sorry for
              me, you don't know me that well.
              We're only friends.

                    DIGGER (softly)
              I stand corrected.

     Tears now.  Stand in her eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm making a big mistake, huh?

                    DIGGER (shrugs)
              Maybe you'll learn something.

     He wraps his hand over hers.  She looks down at it.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm gonna bring him back, man.
              Against all odds, y'know.  Cos
              if I don't...

     She wraps her fingers around his.

                    JULIANNE
              ... I gotta live with it forever.

     Looks in his eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              And at my wedding.  I'll be the
              only bride with her own best man.

     And she kisses his cheek.

     Jumps out of his car.  Before she cries.  Yanks her bags from the
     back.  Brave smile.

     They trade small salutes.  And then she's gone.

     INT.  O'HARA AIRPORT, CHICAGO - MORNING

     The jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony
     called O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull
     fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,
     looking all around, and...

     ... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish
     grin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just
     dangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face
     lights to see her, and she...

     ... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off
     heedless civilians, to be...

     ... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like
     crazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down...

     ... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her.

                    MICHAEL (murmurs)
              Can you believe it? Can you believe
              I'm actually gonna do this?

                    JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)
              Not hardly.

     He beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and...

     ... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it
     is a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and
     vapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.

     She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in
     her fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne
     and Kimmy...

     ... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight,
     with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.
     As Michael beams.

                    KIMMY
              This just makes everything so
              perfect.

     Her arms stay around the slightly dazed Julianne.  The younger
     girl leans close, confides...

                    KIMMY
              All I've heard, from the day I
              met Michael, is Julianne this,
              and Julianne that...

                    JULIANNE
              Well, we're...

                    KIMMY
              I think the best part of marrying
              this guy is finding you.

     Pale gray eyes.  Alive with joy and intimacy.

                    KIMMY
              I've never had a sister.

     INT.  KIMMY'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY

     Kimmy TEARING down the throughway in her Mercedes 500 SL, a
     dashing, confident driver.  Julianne riding shotgun, hair flying, a
     total wreck, in the open convertible.  Michael is happily crouched
     on the little platform behind their seats, hugging his knees.  The
     roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them.

                    KIMMY
              My heart's in my throat, here.
              Right off, I have to ask this
              monstrous favor...

                    JULIANNE
              You need a few dollars.

     Kim glances over.  At eighty miles an hour.  A bittersweet look.

                    KIMMY
              Dry.  Just like he said.

     Her eyes at once admiring and regretful.

                    JULIANNE
              Excuse me?

                    KIMMY
              I can be quick.  I can even
              be funny.

     Shakes her head.  An endearing youngster.

                    KIMMY
              But I can't be dry.

                    JULIANNE
              Can you watch the road?

                    KIMMY
              See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.

     She looks back to the highway.

                    KIMMY
              This is a very presumptuous
              and burdensome fav...

                    JULIANNE
              ... you want a menage on your
              wedding night.

                    KIMMY (straight back)
              No, that wouldn't be burdensome.

     Julianne studying the delicate, angular profile.  Hard not to like
     this kid.

                    KIMMY
              My classmate Angelique shattered
              her pelvis line dancing in
              Abeline on Spring Break.

     Looks over.  The sweetest smile.

                    KIMMY
              Be my maid of honor.

     Julianne just blinks.

                    KIMMY
              You can't believe what it'd
              cost to bring in a temp.

                    JULIANNE
              Uh.  How about promoting a
              bridesmaid?  Someone you know
              for at least forty-five minutes.

     We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn.  Kimmy fearless,
     oblivious, and analytical...

                    KIMMY
              The bridesmaids are my only two
              female relatives under forty.
              Identical twin debutantes from
              Nashville, who are basically
              vengeful sluts.  With amazing
              bodies!

                    JULIANNE
              Which was the disqualifying
              factor?

                    KIMMY
              The twin part.  I like to remain
              impartial in my contempt.

     Sees the off-ramp, and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets
     in a heart-stopping nanosecond.  This kid could drive for Penske.
     Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started.  Looks
     back to see if Michael fell out...

     ... he is absurdly wind-blown.  Gives her a beautiful grinning
     thumbs-up.  Loves this stuff.

                    KIMMY
              This means I have four days
              to make you my new best friend...

     Brings Julianne's eyes back...

                    KIMMY
              And since I already know everything
              about you.  Including intimate
              facts I'm mortified to have heard,
              but too envious to forget.  It's
              time for you to learn about me...

     Easing off the freeway.  She meets Julianne's glance...

                    KIMMY
              Force yourself.  To get personal.

                    JULIANNE (smiles)
              Sounds like a plan.

     INT.  DRESS SHOP, NORTH MICHIGAN AVENUE - MORNING

     The place is stunning.  High-ceiling, soft light, large rococo
     mirrors, Louis Quatorze sofas and chairs.  Michael wanders rest-
     lessly, fish out of water among designer displays and stylish
     female patrons.

     Takes a look at his watch.

     INT.  DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

     A period sitting room, ringed with mirrors along its tapestried
     walls.  Kimmy sits on a Louis Treize loveseat next to a stack of
     costly gowns.  Watching with an expertise beyond her years, as...

     ... Julianne stands on a platform.  A seamstress fitting her into a
     sleek pale daffodil-colored gown.  There are pins everywhere, as
     the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit.  Continuously
     looking to Kim for approval.

                    KIMMY
              If you'd rather the lilac...

     Julianne shakes her head.  This one is beautiful.

                    JULIANNE
              I thought bridesmaids had to wear
              the same dress.

                    KIMMY
              Not you.  You won't be comfortable
              unless you're distinctive.

     Julianne glances over.

                    JULIANNE
              What else did he tell you...

                    KIMMY
              ... you hate weddings, you never go.

     Oh.  Well, yeah.

                    KIMMY
              You're not up for anything
              conventional, or popularly
              assumed to be female priorities.
              Including marriage.  Or romance.
              Or even...

     And she stops.  Not wanting to offend.

                    JULIANNE (quietly)
              ... not even love.

     The look holds.  The seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.

                    JULIANNE
              That's why Michael and I were
              the wrong fit.  Right from the
              start.

                    KIMMY
              He said that, too.

     She stands up.  Walks to the platform.  Smooths her hand over the
     fabric down Julianne's back, along her hips.  Communicating to the
     seamstress with her irritated expression.

                    KIMMY
              Well, I thought I was like you.
              And proud to be.  Until I met
              rumpled, smelly old Michael...

     Pins start to come out.  Kimmy points, these, too!

                    KIMMY
              And then I found I was just a
              sentimental schmuck.  Like all
              those flighty nitwits I'd always
              pitied.

     She leans forward.  So they can look at each other.

                    KIMMY
              Funny world, huh?

     Julianne swallows.  It is that.

                    JULIANNE
              I need a smoke.

     And before anyone can breathe, she steps OFF the platform RIPPING
     the living shit out of the gown, right down the side.  The seam-
     stress' eyes FLASH OPEN in abject horror.  Julianne, a deer in
     headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw-up in
     six different mirrors.

     Kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...

                    KIMMY
              It's mostly the seam.  Let's
              get this to Carlos.

     And UNZIPS Julianne down the back.  In her rush to step out,
     Julianne STUMBLES,  but her arms are pinned by the pulled-down dress
     and she just...

     ... TOPPLES like a felled oak, THUDDING on her face, the gown
     RIPPING some more, the seamstress SCREAMING like an idiot.

     Then.  Silence.  Julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog,
     bound in her dress.

                    KIMMY (firm)
               Just.  Don't.  Move.

     Like you talk to a three-year-old.  Deftly, Kimmy pulls the
     dress free, leaving Julianne in her underwear.  Signals to the
     seamstress, let's go.

                    JULIANNE
              Don't you have to be somewh...

                    KIMMY
              ... just my bridal shower.  And
              Michael has to meet our dads and
              the groomsmen at Comiskey for a
              one-thirty game.

     Opens the door...

                    KIMMY
              Other than that...

     Closed SOLID.  Gone.

     INT.  DRESSING ROOM - LATER

     Julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties, lighting one
     cigarette from the butt of another.  Suddenly, she hears...

     ... an ARGUMENT outside the door.  Strains to listen.  It does sound
     like Michael and Kim.  We can't make out the words.  She jumps up,
     dashes for the door, STUBBING her toe on the platform, SHIT!, falls
     heavily AGAINST the door with a THUD that makes her wince, and...

     ... the argument stops.  Damn.  She opens the door a crack.  Sees
     nothing.  Opens it wider to reveal...

     ... a teenaged BOY looking right at her.  He sends a true shit-
     eating grin and she SLAMS the door hard enough to RATTLE walls.

     She PACES furiously, helplessly, arms around her half-naked self,
     until...

     ... soft knock.  The door opens a crack, and her daffodil gown
     comes through it.

                    JULIANNE
              Come in, and shut the...

     Stops.  Because it's Michael who has entered.  With the dress.

                    JULIANNE
              ... door.

     So he does.  She flushes and SNATCHES up her own clothes, which
     were characteristically tangled in a heap, and tries desperately to
     untangle them enough to cover herself.  He is amazed and amused by
     her embarrassment.

                    MICHAEL (laughing)
              Should I turn around, or someth...

                    JULIANNE
              Michael, I'm in my underwear!

     She's TEARING at her clothes, only making more of a mess.

                    MICHAEL
              We've seen each other a lot
              more naked than this.

     She seems ready to rip her clothes apart, so he gently takes them
     from her hands.  She tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily
     untangles them.

                    MICHAEL
              I mean, we were skinny-dipping
              in Greece, just as pals, less
              than two years ago.

     She GRABS the clothes and covers the front of herself.  Looking at
     him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.

                    JULIANNE
              Things are different now.

     He looks in her eyes.  And nods, a little sadly.  Guess they are.

                    MICHAEL (softly)
              Well.  I leave with two thoughts
              in my mind.

     He walks to the door.  Puts his hand on the latch.  Looks back...

                    MICHAEL (even softer)
              You're still a very pretty
              girl.

     The look holds.  And holds.  There is such feeling on both sides,
     she doesn't know what to make of it.  She swallows.

                    JULIANNE
              What's the sec...

                    MICHAEL
              Mirrors.

     And he's gone.  She looks around at six different VIEWS of her
     uncovered backside.  Hmm.

     INT.  HOTEL UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY

     The parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up.
     These girls must be late for something, the way they're jumping out
     of the car.

                    JULIANNE
              ... luckiest guy in the Northern
              Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...

                    KIMMY
              What? Because I'm a little
              understand...

                    JULIANNE
              ... most sentimental schmucks I
              pity want a honeymoon after their
              wedding.  Just to top it off.

     The valet gives Kimmy her ticket.

                    KIMMY
              I can't expect the NBA to hold
              up the playoffs...

     They're walking fast toward the garage elevators...

                    KIMMY
              I'm excited Sports Illustrated
              gave him this kind of shot, he's
              only there a ye...

                    JULIANNE
              So your honeymoon is exactly where?

     Well...

                    KIMMY
              It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps
              Sacramento, we could start there.
              Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana-
              Clevel...

                    JULIANNE
              ... garden sports, all.  Little swing
              of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit,
              represents a packing challenge, but
              there's fine food and cocktails at a
              choice of Embassy Suit...

     At the elevator.  Kimmy SLAMS the button.

                    KIMMY
              It's his career, I'm supportive.
              Look, I've been everywhere, I've
              seen the world, I've laid on a beach.
              I want to be with the man I love.
              That's what makes it a honeymoon.

     End of story.  Okay?

                    JULIANNE
              I'm just saying he's lucky.

     An empty elevator arrives.  They get in.

                    JULIANNE
              Takes one woman in a billion to
              put up with his array of shit.
              The guy is a one-man festival of
              idiosync...

     Kimmy SLAMS the penthouse button.  Looks at her calmly.  Go on.

                    JULIANNE
              Well.  You've been introduced
              to the symphonic range of...

                    KIMMY
              ... his snoring, yeah.  He says
              it's worse than ever.  That
              snaffle one...?

     Julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high-pitched SNARL.  Three
     times.  Kimmy nods.

                    KIMMY
              Well now it has this sorta
              phlegm rattle behind it...

     Stopped at the lobby.  A family of four gets in.  Oblivious, Kimmy
     DEMONSTRATES the phlegm rattle.  Really gets into it.  As the
     family watches, Julianne tries her own version.  Like that? No.
     More like this.  The family is looking at each other.

                    KIMMY
              Guess what? Earplugs work.

     Oh.

                    JULIANNE
              How about...

                    KIMMY
              ... cigars in bed? I broke him
              on that.  But the bathroom's a
              swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner,
              tells the same, admittedly funny,
              jokes three hundred times...

     Sucks in a breath...

                    KIMMY
              ... loves action movies, subscribes
              to Playboy for godsake, reads over
              my shoulder, can't keep track of
              the checks he writes...

     Ninth floor.  The family gets out.  The door closes.

                    KIMMY
              He sucks soup through his
              front teeth.

                    JULIANNE
              A trademark move, don't touch
              it.

                    KIMMY
              But he sure can kiss.

                    JULIANNE
              It's been awhile.  I'll take
              your word.

                    KIMMY
              After two weeks of cataloguing
              all his faults, I made a command
              decision that changed my life.

     She SLAMS the EMERGENCY STOP button.  We JOLT to a halt.

                    KIMMY
              I threw the list away.

     Shakes her head.

                    KIMMY
              He's not a balance sheet, so
              many wonderful qualities, so
              many faults.  He's Michael.

     From her heart.

                    KIMMY
              And loving him means loving
              all of this.

                    JULIANNE
              Do you get nervous in small
              confined spaces?

                    KIMMY
              So it's sweet of you to be
              protective...

                    JULIANNE
              Let me rephrase that...

                    KIMMY
             But nothing ever could, ever
             did, give me a moment's pause
             about this marriage...

                     JULIANNE
             Do you get hysterical in small
             confined spa...

                    KIMMY
              ... except one.

     Julianne's face.  Stops.

                    JULIANNE
              Oh, yeah?

     Kimmy nods.  Confides...

                    KIMMY
              You.

     A stopper.

                    KIMMY
              You'll always be there.  In his
              mind.  The perfect creature he
              loved for all those y...

                    JULIANNE
              Well, perfection can get wearing
              after whi...

                    KIMMY
              I'm not joking.  I had to face
              up to all my competitive drives,
              and believe me, I've got 'em.

                    JULIANNE
              No.

                    KIMMY
              And the answer was so simple.

                    JULIANNE
              I was gonna predict that.

                    KIMMY
              You win.

     Julianne blinks.  Excuse me?

                    KIMMY
              You're enshrined in his heart
              and memory.  Unassailable.
              Which works out great.

                    JULIANNE
              I've missed a step.

                    KIMMY
              He has you on a pedestal.  And
              me in his arms.

     Oh.  Julianne smiles.  LUNGES for the EMERGENCY button, YANKING it
     so hard it comes OFF in her hand.  A terrifying BUZZER ensures.

                    JULIANNE
              Jesus, we're trapped!

                    KIMMY
              Ju...

                    JULIANNE
              No, this happened to me once,
              almost, it was excruciating!

     Begins BANGING random buttons, out of control.  Kimmy watching
     this.  Julianne looks WILDLY up...

                    JULIANNE
              There's a panel up there, you
              could boost me...

     RIPPING off her platform shoes.

                    JULIANNE
              You know how little air is
              in these things? I've seen
              statistics! Once you're trapped
              between floors...

     Kimmy taps her.  Points to the lighted panel.  It says PH, they've
     reached the Penthouse.

                    JULIANNE
              God! Then the door is jammed!

     Takes a heavy platform and begins BANGING the metal door with all
     her strength, sending resounding BOOMS throughout the area, as
     Kimmy reaches and...

     ... presses DOOR OPEN.  The metal doors part, opening directly onto
     the banquet room, just as a mighty blow comes down, and the platform
     FLIES from Julianne's hand straight BETWEEN...

     ... two identical stunning YOUNG WOMEN, serving as twin hostesses
     for the shower.  A beat of mutually-stupefied looks, and we hear
     the shoe CRASH somewhere, to a small spattering of SHRIEKS.

                    MANDY
              Mah Gawd, it's the bride,
              and the woman she'll nevah
              live up to!

                    KIMMY (mutters to Julianne)
              That would be us.

                    SAMMY
              Did she say th' wrong thang
              agin? It is so in character!

     AMANDA and SAMANTHA NEWHOUSE, 19-year-old twins.  True Southern
     belles, with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil
     wrestling.  Mandy's hair is dyed ash blonde, Sammy's is amber.
     Otherwise, the experience is similar.

                    JULIANNE
                   (thrusts out her hand)
              I'm Julianne Potter, and...

                    SAMMY
              ... we'd be the vengeful sluts.
              We came in complementary colors.

                    MANDY
              Have you sized up the groomsmen,
              Jules?  As M. of H., you get
              first fuck.  Don't pick the
              short, hairy, rich one.

                    JULIANNE
              ... unless he has a hump.

     The girls cast identical blank looks at Kimberly.

                    KIMMY (to the sluts)
              Dry.  I told you.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              Is this Michael's Julianne?

     All eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely 40.  She has her
     daughter's hair and eyes and slender form.  But the bearing rules
     half an empire.  Fonda would envy.

                    ISABELLE
              I'm Isabelle Wallace, and my
              handsome new son scarcely did
              you justice, girl.

     She takes both of Julianne's hands, and our heroine is sort of
     magically charmed.  As if touched by Glinda the Good Witch of the
     North.

                    ISABELLE
              Now, my husband says to scoot
              you over to the ballpark, so
              you can hang with Michael.  But
              first, you have to meet a lot of
              really old women.

     Looking warmly in her eyes...

                    ISABELLE
              That is, if you've absorbed
              enough profanity.

     Flicks a glance at the twins.  Leads Julianne off...

                    MANDY (O.S., pouting)
              We sayed one fuck.

     INT.  TAXI, SOUTH SIDE - DAY

     Cab crawling toward COMISKEY PARK through stifling traffic.
     Julianne oblivious, cellular to her ear...

                    JULIANNE
              Desperate measures! Do you
              hear me?  Digger, are you the...

     SQUAWK.  Static.  Then...

                    JULIANNE
              I don't know, hit men, whoopee
              cushions, saltpeter, something!
              The girl is impossibly impregnable.
              Even I want her to get the guy!!

     Listens.

                    JULIANNE
              Tell him the what? The truth...??

     She shakes her head.  What a guy.

                    JULIANNE
              That desperate.  May I never get.

     INT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON

     Game in progress.  Watched by Michael, three groomsmen his age, two
     middle-aged men, and one bodyguard.  Suddenly, a dull THUMPING at
     the door.  It keeps up.  They finally all look over.  The bodyguard
     gets the door, revealing...

                    JULIANNE
              Which of you gents ordered
              two beers?

     One single tray.  Holding fourteen beers.  Balancing on one hand.
     Michael JUMPS UP, terrified at the impending mayhem this sight
     suggests...

                    MICHAEL
              Wow!  Lemme give you a ha...

                    JULIANNE (sweetly)
              Michael.  You'll unwittingly
              imply that I'm clumsy.

     He stops in his tracks.  The guys whistle.

                    MICHAEL
              Think of that.  And as well as
              I know you.

     She goes first to the bodyguard.

                      BODYGUARD
              Sorry, ma'am, I'm on duty.

                    JULIANNE (lovely smile)
              It's Miss.  And thanks.  That
              leaves two for me.

     Heads down the row...

                    MICHAEL
              Julianne Potter, this is Hank
              and Gerry from SI, and you know
              Daniel...

     She's nodding, flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter
     of the tray, keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center.
     Michael is flat dumbstruck.  Next, a tall patrician gentleman with
     rolled-up sleeves on his hand-stitched silk shirt...

                    MICHAEL
              Oh.  This is my father-in-law,
              Walter.

     Once again, she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished
     father-in-law...

                    MICHAEL
              How are you doing this? You're
              on drugs.

     Sets them down.  The man has a smile wonderful in its ease.
     Murmurs...

                      WALTER
              If he gives you grief, I'll have
              him skillfully beaten, where the
              wounds won't show.

                    JULIANNE
              I guess getting him whacked would
              be politically out of the question.

                    WALTER
              Under the circumstances.  Charmed
              to know you, Jules.

                    JULIANNE
              Nice meeting you, too, Walt.

     A nod between equals.  She moves on...

                    MICHAEL
              And, this guy, you know...

     She sure does, and effortlessly balancing her one-hand load, she
     dips to kiss a porky, balding guy with big-time shoulders.
     Straight on the lips.

                    JULIANNE
              Papa Joe.

     They go way back.  He is uncomfortable at this rich man's wedding,
     even as gracious as everyone has been.  His watering eyes twinkle
     at her, and the voice has a trace of Boston...

                    JOE
             You gonna be my boy's best man?

     Despite SHOUTS from the others...

                    JULIANNE
              Best everything, Joe.  But I'm
              going to dance with you.

                    MICHAEL
              Dance?  You don't dance!  You
              learn to dance??

     Her innocent smile.

                    JULIANNE
              Moves.  You've never seen.

     BIG reaction from the guys, as she heads toward Michael with the
     last of the beers, not looking down at the FIELDER'S MITT which
     lies right in her path, and as his lips part to scream a warning,
     she skips...

     ... neatly AROUND it.  He's in shock.

                    MICHAEL
              You're an impostor! What have
              you done with my best friend?

     As he takes away the remaining beers...

                    MICHAEL
              And how was the hot dog?

     Hot dog? His eyes fix on her left breast.  HUGE mustard stain.
     She can't believe it.

                    MICHAEL
              Cheap and unnecessary.  We were
              looking anyway.

     EXT.  LUXURY BOX ROOF - DAY

     Michael and Julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury
     box roof.  The game, the stadium, spread out beneath them.  Yet
     they are alone in the world.  She dangles her legs, and we can hear
     her kicking the glass below.

                    JULIANNE
              I just admire your maturity,
              that's all.  I mean, there are
              people who would find that kind of
              perfection boring.  Day after day,
              year after year...

                    MICHAEL
              ... see, that's what I thought at
              first.  How can you like someone
              that perfect? No potential for
              long-range livability.

     Drinking their beers.  Side by side.  Both stare only at the game.

                    MICHAEL
              Luckily.  The closer I watched,
              the more the fault came into
              focus.  Each imperfection its own
              adorable slice of vulnerability.

                    JULIANNE
              Such as.

                    MICHAEL
              She's too genuine.

                    JULIANNE
              Hate that.

                    MICHAEL
              How can you trust someone you
              can never mistrust?

                    JULIANNE
              What's next?

     Keep sipping.  Never look at each other.

                    MICHAEL
              No matter how many times I
              leave the toilet seat up, she
              forgets and puts it down.

                    JULIANNE
              Endearingly absent-minded.

                    MICHAEL
              My very point.  Here's another one...

     Shakes his head.  This one really gets him.

                    MICHAEL
              Every day.  She makes the bed.

                    JULIANNE
              Quite the little eccentric.

                    MICHAEL
              At first, I thought it was a
              gag, but she's always done it!

     This is not the ammunition Julianne was hoping for.

                    JULIANNE
              Is there a coup de grace in
              here, somewh...

                    MICHAEL
              She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.

                    JULIANNE
              Waiter! Check, please!

                    MICHAEL
              She finds him "personable."

                    JULIANNE
              Can that kind of defect be
              passed on genetically?

     She looks over now.  And Michael is looking back.  Smiling the most
     wonderful smile.  Her reaction shows that she thinks it's for her,
     until...

                    MICHAEL
              Then again.  She has a few good
              traits.

     Hating herself for asking, but seeing no way out...

                    JULIANNE
              Gimme like, eight and nine off
              the top ten list...

                    MICHAEL
              First girl I ever knew.  Who
              lets me give her a bath.

     The look in his eyes.  She can hardly bear it.

                    MICHAEL
              And when I hug her, even in
              public.  I don't have to let go
              right away.  She lets me hold
              her as long as I want.

     He seems so deeply in love.

                    MICHAEL
              Nice kid, don't you think?

     A beat.  A slow nod.  A quiet...

                    JULIANNE
              Looks like, from here.

     INT.  SOUTH SIDE CLUB - NIGHT

     A slender black woman sings a SOARING Gospel number, backed by
     three ladies who could each solo in any church choir.  It is
     mesmerizing, stirring, transcendent.  The unseen audience CLAPPING
     FIERCELY in rhythm, SHOUTING support.  SLOW PAN now...

     ... every face is black.  We aren't in church at all, but a
     venerable blue club.  One of those places you'd swear everybody's
     played, from Robert Johnson to Bessie Smith and back again.  As
     the song ends, there is APPLAUSE, some RAPPING on tables with their
     knuckles or their drunks.  We keep PANNING to a far corner.  Three
     faces.

     Julianne leans across her beer to Kimmy...

                    JULIANNE
              How'd you find this pl...

     Kim shaking her head.  Looks admiringly to Michael...

                    KIMMY
              Lived here my whole life,
              never heard of it.  Until
              our first date.

     She reaches slender fingers.  Traces one back along his hair.

                    KIMMY
              He finds all these spots,
              everywhere he goes, it's a
              mystical gift.

                    MICHAEL (shy)
              Jesus, one d-back from the Bears
              knows a place...

                    KIMMY
              It's not just clubs.  This guy
              always knows the best everything.
              The best guitar store, the best
              beef ribs, the best Horowitz record,
              was he always like the...

                    JULIANNE
              ... always.  The best dim sum, the
              best camping stuff...

                    KIMMY
              Stop, we're embarrassing h...

                    JULIANNE
              ... best valley in New Zealand,
              best... women's shoes...

                    MICHAEL
              I tried those on.  When you
              weren't looking.

     Now he's grinning at Julianne.  And she likes that a lot.

                    JULIANNE
              Where was that, Florence, huh?

                    MICHAEL
              Firenze.

     Together in the memory.  As Kimmy watches.

                    JULIANNE
              The Vespa? Me hanging on behind
              in the rain all night?

                    MICHAEL
              Till the gas ran out.

     And, the first sniff of left-out...

                    KIMMY
              I love Florence.

     Julianne's eyes flicker.  Could this be a teensy opening? Keeps
     her eyes, her easy smile, and her killer instincts trained on
     Michael.

                    JULIANNE
              Take her there.

     He nods, okay.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean, now.  She's perky,
              she deserves a honeymoon.

     He draws a breath...

                    JULIANNE
              I heard.  If San Antone sweeps
              Sacramento.  What is this shit?
              You gotta get off the road by
              September anyway, when does Fall
              Quarter start?

     And the happy couple look at each other.  They are awkward.
     Julianne's heart soar like eagle.

                    KIMMY
              Uh.  I'm not coming back.  For
              senior year.

     Could this be.  The Mother Lode?

                    JULIANNE
              Don't architects find a degree,
              sort of... an asset?

     The couple still staring in each other's eyes.

                    KIMMY
              Well, the school will be here.
              Architecture will still be around.
              Right now...

                    MICHAEL
              I travel every week.  College
              ball, motor sports, training
              camps...

                    KIMMY
              The most important thing. Is
              being together.

     And she smiles.  Beautifully.

                    KIMMY
              I'm just a baby.  I've got all...
              the time... in the world.

     EXT.  CLUB - NIGHT

     Michael putting Kim in the back of a cab.  As Julianne watches.

                    MICHAEL
              Because I could come...

                    KIMMY
              To the twins' soiree?  So they
              can paw you and drool...?

                    JULIANNE (calls out, helpful)
              They're gonna drool anyway!

     Kim smiles.  He kisses her, tenderly, through the open window.  She
     waves past him at Julianne.

                    KIMMY (to both)
             Enjoy each other.

     And drives off.  As he watches after, Julianne comes up behind him.
     Slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle.  Starts giving a little
     massage.

                    JULIANNE
              Should I whistle down a cab?

                    MICHAEL
              Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm
              cheap, remember?

     Turns his head, to see her.  She's still rubbing his shoulder.

                    JULIANNE
              Sometimes.  About the dumbest
              things.

     Share a smile.  As always, it covers a lot of years.

                    MICHAEL
              The El's right down the street.
              Unless you're afraid of the
              neighborhood.

     She looks around.  It is an issue.  But she remembers...

                    JULIANNE
              No.  I'm always safe with you.

     She means that.  He takes her by the hand.  They begin walking...

                    JULIANNE
              Pretty amazing girl, you've got.
              Make that kind of sacrifice.

                    MICHAEL
              What, leaving school...

                    JULIANNE
              ... all of it.  She's leaving her
              family, her friends, everything she
              knows.  She's putting her career
              on hold, and she seems a pretty
              ambitious, driven, kind of pers...

                    MICHAEL (quietly)
              In her way.

                    JULIANNE
              All to follow you in this dumb
              job, where you travel 52 weeks
              a year to College Station, Texas,
              and such.  It's not a job for a
              grown man, Michael, Peter Pan
              never married.

     He's let go of her hand now.  Looking down at the pavement before
     him, fists in his jacket pockets.

                    JULIANNE (softly)
              I don't think she's naturally
              the... submissive type.  Aren't you
              afraid she's gonna choke on this
              stand-by-your-man shit after awhi...

                    MICHAEL (real quiet)
              No.

     Hit a nerve.  This is promising.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable
              sports... most girls in her spot would
              be angling to get Daddy to offer you
              some juicy gig right here in t...

                    MICHAEL
              She would never.  Never.  Even think
              of that.

     Paydirt.  Julianne's Geiger Counter is going berserk.

                    JULIANNE
              I guess you're right.  That would
              be deceitful... manipulative...
              controlling... emascula...

                    MICHAEL
              I got the point.

     He looks over at her.  No smile on his face.  An edge we haven't
     seen.  She shrugs...

                    JULIANNE
              Still.  All's fair in love and
              w...

                    MICHAEL
              That would be a girl.  I don't
              even know.

     They've reached the stairs to the El.  A rickety train RATTLES
     above them.  As they start up, she slips her arm around his
     waist...

                    JULIANNE (murmurs)
              Forgive me, okay? I was talkin'
              crazy.

     He slides his arm around her shoulder.  Pals.  They climb out of
     frame.

     INT.  HOTEL BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

     CLOSE on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink.  Green powder
     pouring in, a hand SWIRLING it around, until...

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              It's Albanian, I think.  Or Mongolian.
              Or Canadian.  One of those.  I bought
              it downstairs...

     ... it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud.

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              I figure, what the hell.  Can it
              make me look worse?

     Follow the hand up as it SLATHERS the shit across her face in great
     green dripping gobs.  She's juggling the wall phone, trying to keep
     it mudless, as she assures Digger...

                    JULIANNE
              Dig, of course.  Of course, of
              course, of course, of course I
              have a plan.  Certainment!

     More green slime.  The Julianne we know disappears.

                    JULIANNE
              How? I ask myself, what would
              Lucy Ricardo do in this situa...

     Desecrates three hotel towels, wiping her hand.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, one worked, once.

     THROWS them in the bathtub.  Fastidiousness a short suit.

                    JULIANNE
              Ricky wouldn't let her in
              the show.

     Reaches for her toothbrush, absently.  All her attention is on the
     conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror.

                    JULIANNE
              I recall it differently, but
              we digress.

     Without looking, picks up a tube of hotel shampoo...

                    JULIANNE
              So in the version, you're Ethel,
              with better fashion instincts.

     Squeezes it all over the toothbrush.

                    JULIANNE
              This puts you in charge of Plan B,
              the unprincipled and insanely
              dangerous back-up plan...

     Lifts it toward her mouth, liquid shampoo dripping from the
     bristles.

                    JULIANNE
              In case simple lying doesn't work.

     At the last second.  She stops.  We don't know why, because she's
     still never looked at the brush.

                    JULIANNE
              Question.  What happens if you
              brush your teeth with shampoo?

     Turns on the tap.  Tries to scrub the toothbrush clean, and DROPS
     the phone into the green swamp, which SPATTERS all over her front.
     Euucch.  She's stymied, agitated, circling the sink, leaning down
     to it...

                    JULIANNE
              HOLD ON.  I'M COMING IN FOR YOU!

     She sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit.  Decides to
     YANK on the phone's cord, and the receiver SPRINGS out, BOPPING
     her in the face.  She's so filthy at this point, she just wipes it
     clean on her nightshirt.  Tells Digger...

                    JULIANNE
              You okay? This is one of those
              problem phones.

     Lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit.

                    JULIANNE
              Right.  Your role.  You know guys
              from Sports Illustrated, yes? I
              mean, you can walk right in there...

     Squeezes on the paste, lifts the brush to her mouth...

                    JULIANNE
              You could get access to letterhead,
              for example.

     JAMS it in her mouth, brushing as...

                    JULIANNE (mouthful)
              ... or even, maybe, their fax.

     Stops.  The funniest look on her face.  Down to the toothpaste
     tube...

     Which says BEN GAY.

     Oh.

     INT.  TIFFANY'S - MORNING

     Julianne and Kimmy cruise the stately display cases.  Everywhere,
     the Tiffany logo, the silent, watchful staff in morning coats.  As
     they browse, Julianne takes a blueberry Danish from a paper sack,
     and begins to eat.

     The staff notices.  So does Kim.

                    JULIANNE
              It's an homage thing.

     Hmm?

                    JULIANNE
              Awkward girls grow up on Audrey
              Hepburn movies.  You wouldn't
              understand.

     Kimmy doesn't.  But wipes a blue glob from Julianne's face.

                    KIMMY
              Anyway, I think you're wrong.

     Wrong?

                    KIMMY
              What you were saying before.

     Before?

                    KIMMY
              About Michael's job.

                    JULIANNE
              Oh, that.  I forgot I even said
              th...

                    KIMMY
              I just think you're wrong, is all.

                    JULIANNE
              Probably am.  Forget I brought it
              up.

     Points to some jade pins.  Kimmy wrinkles her nose.

                    KIMMY
              I mean, he loves his job.

                    JULIANNE
              Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad
              flights, bad hotels, real bad food.
              Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe
              your copy gets into one issue out
              of four...

     Smiles.

                    JULIANNE
              What's not to love?

     None of this is lost on Kimmy.  She's wondered the same.

                    KIMMY
              But he always says...

                    JULIANNE
              ... whatever is manly and
              independent.

     Kim nods slowly.  Way ahead of her.

                    JULIANNE
              Why would he trade that for
              running, say, a big piece of
              the PR at a powerful, complex,
              challenging conglomerate like
              your dad's?

     Kim stares back.  A strange look.

                    KIMMY
              That's just the sort of thing
              my father and I discussed.

     Julianne just blinks.  Amazed.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm not stupid.  Say, how
              about this?

     Pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case.  Kim so
     absorbed by the main topic, she has to force herself to focus on...

                    KIMMY
              For the twins? What in the
              world is th...

                    JULIANNE
              Gold nose hair clippers.

     Points to the tiny hand-lettered sign.  Indeed.  Kimmy shrugs, not
     quite it.

                    KIMMY
              So you don't think Michael's
              as happy with his job as...

     Julianne points to a matched pair of large...

                    KIMMY
              Gold dog collars? They don't
              have dogs.

                    JULIANNE
              Hello.

     Kim nods, oh.  But can't keep her mind off...

                    KIMMY
              You think he'd accept?

     Hmm?

                    KIMMY
              Michael.  A job like that.

     Oh, well...

                    JULIANNE
              By any yardstick that involves
              sanity, it would be the greatest
              thing that ever happened to him.
              Present company excepted.

     Kimmy nodding slowly.  Her yearing achingly apparent.

                    JULIANNE
              On the other hand, he's proud.
              Last thing a man wants to admit,
              is being trapped in a dispiriting
              dead-end job that can never
              support a family.

     A very sweet smile.

                    JULIANNE
              Throw a man a life preserver.
              He'll say, "Thanks, anyway,
              I'd rather drown."

     Kim nods again.  Right.  They are so bonded at this moment.

                    KIMMY
              So... one almost has to...

                    JULIANNE
              Exactly.

                    KIMMY
              Exactly what?

                    JULIANNE
              What you said.  Make it appear
              that he's doing you the favor.

     Kimmy bites her lip.  Her eyes go down.  Self-conscious to admit...

                    JULIANNE
              I couldn't really... do that.
              After, you know...

     Her voice trails off.

                    JULIANNE (kind, but wise)
              ... lying.  All the time.

     That brings the gray eyes up.  Julianne bats her dark ones...

                    JULIANNE
              Oh, darling, my pitiful desires
              and ambitions are dirt beneath
              the manly boots of your priorities!

     Kimmy has to smile small.  A self-awe gal.

                    JULIANNE (pouring it on)
              Two hundred seedy motels a year?
              Dinners out of vending machines?
              Waiting for you in vermin-infested
              corridors of dark crotch-rot locker
              rooms? This stuff makes me hot!!

                    KIMMY
              The very words I've used.

     Julianne 'thinks it over.' Kimmy waits for guidance.

                    JULIANNE
              We make Dad your co-conspirator.
              Michael does a favor for Walter.

     Simple.

                    JULIANNE
              Walter's reorganizing his public
              relations, needs a brilliant guy
              who's close to him, who he can
              completely trust.

     Kimmy nodding.  Hope overriding reason.

                    JULIANNE
              So you beg.  Michael, please do
              this for Daddy, please, please,
              please, blah, blah, blah... it's
              only for six months...  it would
              mean so much to me to help him out...

     Turns up her palms.  Viola!

                    KIMMY
              He'll see right through it.

                    JULIANNE
              Only.  If he wants to.

     They share a smile.

                    JULIANNE
              In six months, he'll be happy,
              settled, successful...

                    KIMMY
              He won't get mad, huh?

                      MR.  MOONEY (O.S.)
              May I be of any help, whatsoever?

     Mr.  Mooney is the most gracious Brit salesperson ever to offer
     kindness, intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer.  He is
     large, sixty, with disappearing hair, watering eyes, and a manner
     that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler.

                    JULIANNE
              Bridesmaid gifts for two, well,
              assertive, outspoken, Tennessee
              debutantes.

                    KIMMY (still focused)
              He won't be mad?

                    JULIANNE (to Mooney)
              Nothing here seems to quite capture
              their distinctive personalities.

                      MR.  MOONEY
              Something customized, perhaps?
              We can fashion most any item
              from gold.

     Ah.  Julianne nodding.  Reflecting.

                    MR.  MOONEY
              An object that might represent
              what is closest. To their heart.

                    KIMMY (under her breath)
              Don't even think dildo.

     Julianne digs through her jumbled bag...

                    JULIANNE
              Could you do this...

     Tossing an object on the counter...

                    JULIANNE
              In 24 carat?

     It is a MASTERCARD.  A gold one.

                    KIMMY (softly)
              Bingo.

     They smile at each other.  More bonded than ever.

                    KIMMY
              You don't think he'll be mad.

     A beat.  Can Julianne even make herself do this?

                    JULIANNE
              Your call.  You can live a lie.
              In a fabulous selection of Red
              Roof Inns.  Or you can make one
              desperate stab at hap...

                    KIMMY
              I just don't want to freak him
              out.

     What do you think? Julianne stares into the soft gray eyes.  It's
     now or never.  The smile of a dear sister...

                    JULIANNE
              How mad could he get?

     INT.  FASHION RESTAURANT - LUNCH HOUR

     Julianne enters with a really nervous Kimberly in tow.  Approaches
     the maitre d'.  We CLOSE to hear...

                    MAITRE D'
              Oh, Mr. Wallace and his guests
              have retired to the humidor.

     Points to an escalator, leading to the mezzanine.  Behind a glass
     wall, what looks like a British men's club.  Thirty guys and a
     billion cigars.  As Julianne starts toward it...

                    MAITRE D'
              Oh.  Mademoiselle.

     She turns back.  Loves this shit.

                    MAITRE D'
              It's unofficial, of course.  But,
              traditionally, the humidor is for
              gentlemen, only...

                    JULIANNE
              Great.  I've got this girlfriend
              at the Justice Department?  With
              all this time on her hands?

     Her look is every bit as hard as his.  He gestures to the
     escalator.  She takes Kimmy's hand, and up they go.  We can see
     Walter in a big leather chair, enjoying a major stogie.  Kimmy
     licks her lips.

     They enter.  Every head turns.  A nice range of reactions, from
     offended to attracted and points in between.

                    JULIANNE (murmurs)
              Piece of cake.  I'll hang, and
              think happy thoughts...

     Kimmy nods.  Heads over toward her father.  Julianne walks,
     confidently, even provocatively, to the wall lined with bins of
     cigars.  Every eye in the place is on her butt.

     She runs her fingers over a few contenders.  Plucks one out,
     examines it, puts it back.  Walks a little farther.  Selects
     another, big and black.  Rolls it expertly in her fingers.  Sniffs
     along its length.

     A guy comes over.  Could be 40, successful, a broker's pin-stripe.
     Nearly as attractive as he thinks he is.

                    GUY
              Know what you're looking for,
              little lady?

     Little lady, huh? She glances at his coven of buddies, who pretend
     not to notice.  Then, straight to the guy's blue eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              Yeah.  Do you?

                    GUY
              I asked first.

     Ah.  Wit.  She holds up her cigar...

                    JULIANNE
              I like 'em long and hard.  Kind
              of... big around.

     Runs it under her nose.

                    JULIANNE
              Smell is important, I'm a believer
              in that.

     Takes a match from a cut crystal bowl.

                    JULIANNE
              But you never know what you've
              got.  Till you run your tongue
              over it.

     And she does.  Moistening the full length of the cigar.  The boys
     are laughing openly.  She STRIKES the match.  As she lights up...

                    GUY
              I meant.  What you're looking for
              in a man.

     She glances at his wedding ring.  Then, straight into his eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              Actually, I'm partial to married
              gentlemen.

     The way she says that.  The guy swallows.  We can see some of the
     air has been sucked from the room.

                    GUY
              Why is that?

                    JULIANNE
              It's so much time.  When I phone
              the wives.

     Explosive LAUGHTER from the peanut gallery.  As she jams the big
     Clemente Churchill into her mouth, she sees Kimmy waving her over
     from across the room.  Without even looking at the guy she's just
     put away...

     ... she crosses the room, Walter stands politely, looking very
     dapper, very powerful, and focusing on her with considerable
     interest.  He waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather
     hassock.

                    WALTER
                   (simply)
              Your idea?

     She can't read this guy.  Maybe that's how he built an empire.  She
     nods, yeah.

                    WALTER
              You're a woman of insight.

     He sits on the arm of his chair.  Close enough to speak quietly.

                    WALTER
              My wife and I love this marriage,
              and deplore its circumstances.

     He puffs his cigar.  Julianne puffs her.  Kimmy looks on, a kid
     watching the grown-ups...

                    WALTER
              As you guessed, my daughter is
              unhappy about giving up her life.
              And, in my opinion, cowardly in
              avoiding the necessary confrontation.

     Then he stops.  As if reading Julianne's eyes.

                    WALTER
              Mike has a world of ability.
              I'd do anything to have him in
              my company.

     One more puff.

                    WALTER
              Except ask him.

     Julianne is a little stunned.  Kimmy looks helpless.

                    WALTER
              He'd resent it.  And me.  And,
              most important, Kim.

     No smile on his lips.  Straight talk.

                    WALTER
              He's a great kid, but he's still
              a kid.  Instead of recognizing
              that his resistance comes from
              insecurity, he'd turn it to anger.
              To protect himself...

     Spreads his hands...

                    WALTER
              ... from realizing that he's
              ignoring my daughter's needs,
              despite how very much he loves her.

     He looks to his daughter now.

                    WALTER
              They both have some growing up
              to do.  But they're good people,
              they're starting with love.
              They've got time.

                    JULIANNE
                   (softly)
              I think you're making a mistake,
              sir.

     His eyes come back to her.  A little sharply.

                    WALTER
              And that interests me.  How
              someone who knows him so well
              could be so wrong.

     A formidable guy.  She meets his gaze.

                    JULIANNE
              See, I love him, too, as much
              as anyone here.  And for a
              whole lot longer.

     From her heart.

                    JULIANNE
              I think I know best what would
              make him happy.

     INT.  TOILET STALL - DAY

     Julianne, fully dressed, sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat.
     The stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut.
     Her cellular phone pressed to her ear, she is listening angrily,
     smoking ferociously, every call in her body running at red-line.

                    JULIANNE
              Okay, okay, okay, okay, I hear
              you, all right?

     She closes her eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              It is stupid, dishonest, desperate
              beyond belief, and can't possibly
              ever work.  It can only end in
              humiliation and disgrace.  Now can
              I say two words?

     Deep drag on the cigarette.  For strength.

                    JULIANNE
              Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
              Do it! Do it!

     She's striped her gears.  COUGHS horribly.

                    JULIANNE
              All right, twelve words.

     INT.  PUBLIC RESTROOM - DAY

     Julianne exits the stall.  To face three BLACK TEENAGE GIRLS.  Just
     staring at her.

                    TEENAGER
                   (supportive)
              You do it, girl.

     Julianne nods to the kids.  They nod back.  Damn straight.  She
     exits the restroom, into...

     ... glaring sunlight.  We are in the middle of the BROOKFIELD ZOO.
     And sitting on a bench, eating popcorn from a bag...

                    MICHAEL
              Wow.  What was going on in
              there?

     She shudders.

                    JULIANNE
              Some crazy person.

     EXT.  ZOO - DAY

     Michael and Julianne walking together.  He's eating his popcorn.
     She carries a cardboard container with nachos, a gooey fudge waffle
     cone, and a large drink.

                    MICHAEL
              You're not eating.

                    JULIANNE
              I never eat when I'm serene.

                    MICHAEL
              You never eat when you're
              despondent.

                    JULIANNE
              I switched that around when you
              weren't looking.

     She swirls a single nacho chip in cheese.  But her heart isn't in it.

                    MICHAEL
              Last zoo we were in was...
              Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos
              were fucking.

                    JULIANNE
              Boy, those were the days.

     And when she looks over.  His eyes are waiting.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Yeah, they were.

     They're passing the hippo pen.  But they don't notice.

                    JULIANNE
              That was nice.  The way you
              said that.

     So was that.  He's feeling restless, something.  Doesn't know quite
     what to say.

                    MICHAEL
              It's weird being the groom.  All
              these things Kimmy has to take
              care of...

                    JULIANNE
              You need a baby-sitter.  That's
              what I'm here for.

     He holds her eyes.  Then looks down.  Awkward.  And the way he's
     doing it begins to excite her.

                    JULIANNE
              Say it.

     He looks up, neither one of them noticing that as they walk, she is
     about to...

     ... CRASH into a chest-high metal stand that displays animal facts.
     We have followed him as she is WIPED from frame.  His face from
     shock... to amusement.

                    MICHAEL
              Now, there's my girl.

     ... to tenderness.  PAN back to see her wearing everything from her
     cardboard container.  Nachos, fudge sauce, Diet Coke, the works.
     It is really awful.  Kids, bystanders, laughing cruelly.  Her eyes
     fill with tears, and she tries bravely to smile against it...

                    JULIANNE
              See, I can only do it with
              beer.

     He takes out his handkerchief.  And with that and his hands, gently
     scoops the worst of the mess off her.  The fact that he's touching
     her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice.
     She laughs softly, and a few tears fall, even though she doesn't
     know why.  Such an odd, raw, confusing moment.  To the world
     looking on, they are lovers.

                    MICHAEL
                   (murmurs)
              See, better already.

     And he kisses her face.  Not quite her lips.  But only an inch away.
     We can feel her heart pounding.  He strips off his shirt, only a tank
     top underneath.

                    MICHAEL
              We'll go back to the bathroom,
              you'll put this on...

     Okay? She sniffles, okay.  Swallows.

                    JULIANNE
              Bet you're glad I'm here to
              take care of you.

     He puts his arm around her.

                    MICHAEL
              Bet I am.

     Holds her close, as they start toward the restroom...

                    MICHAEL
              Hope that crazy person's not
              still there.

     We're on their backs...

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              She doesn't scare me.

     EXT.  BEACH CLUB, LAKE MICHIGAN - SUNSET

     Julianne in T-shirt and shorts, rushes onto the deck of a sprawling
     beach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...

     ... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
     Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN
     with her to find a crowd around...

     ... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on
     one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear
     spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
     predictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...

     ... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
     Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
     defense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
     him a savage...

     ... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
     proud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
     Laughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
     hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good
     sport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...

     ... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
     set up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's
     pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
     coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
     Julianne races across the sand to...

     ... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
     clearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something
     into his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a
     club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.

     CLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
     He's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge...

                    JULIANNE
                   (whispers)
              Is anybody watching?

                    WALTER
              I hope so.  This is all too
              mysterious to waste on just me.

     She reaches into her big bag.  Pulls out a single folded sheet of
     paper.

                    JULIANNE
              I picked up Michael's messages
              for him, at our hotel.  I stole
              one...

     His face darkens.  The easy smile fades.  He holds up his palms...

                    WALTER
              Julianne, reading my son-in-law's
              mail, is not something...

                    JULIANNE
              Sir, this is important! Haven't
              you ever in your life cut one
              corner, to make something important
              turn out right?

     His smile returns.  Just a little.

                     WALTER
              Matter of fact, that's how I got
              married.

     The look holds.  She thrusts the paper out.  He still doesn't take
     it.

                    JULIANNE
              It's a fax from Sports Illustrated
              from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.

                    WALTER
                   (quickly)
              I know Ben.

     She opens the paper.

                    JULIANNE
              "Mike.  We still have no answer to
              our E-mail of Wednesday.  Which
              option do you select? I don't mean
              to rush you, but Personnel needs to
              tie up the loose ends."

     He takes the paper.  We see it now.  Looks authentic.

                    JULIANNE
              I think he's been fired.

                    WALTER
              It doesn't say th...

                    JULIANNE
              He's said some things over the
              past few weeks.  Look, this is why
              I came up with the idea of you
              offering him a job.

     He looks up.  He's listening.  Closely.

                    JULIANNE
              And why I couldn't say anything
              before in front of Kim.

     She bites her lip.  Seems so earnest.

                    JULIANNE
              I just think of how... desperate
              he must be feeling.  He's marrying
              a rich man's daughter, and he's
              about to become destitute.  You
              know the kind of job market he'll
              be facing?

     He does.

                    WALTER
              And you think he's kept this to
              himself.

                    JULIANNE
              He's too proud to beg for help.
              And if you wait till this comes out,
              your offer will be like charity.
              Completely humiliating.

     He's staring at her.  But his mind is working behind his eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              If you do it now, it's like he's
              helping you.  He can accept with
              dignity.

     He taps the paper with the back of his knuckles.

                    WALTER
              This fax could mean... any number
              of things...

     She nods.  She knows that.

                    WALTER
                   (softly)
              Maybe.  I should call Ben.

                    JULIANNE
              Then it could all come out, sooner
              or later.  Nobody should be in on
              this.  Just you and me.  Or, more
              correctly, I.

     She takes the paper back.

                    JULIANNE
              What if, what if I could find
              that E-mail?

     The long straight look.  Maybe he's hooked.

                    JULIANNE
              I never noticed.  Kimmy has your
              eyes.

     INT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON HOTEL - TWILIGHT

     Tall, gangly, young DESK CLERK.  Lank hair, pimples.  He looks up,
     beams to see...

                    JULIANNE
              Hello, again.

     She's flirting her ass off.

                    JULIANNE
              You still haven't straightened
              that tie.

     And she reaches across the desk with her lovely, slender hands.
     Does it for him.  Her fingers brush his chest on the way back.  We
     can assume a woody.

                    JULIANNE
              You know, my friend, the one
              whose message I picked up...  ?

     He does.  His eyes flick toward his stately female SUPERVISOR,
     helping another guest across the way.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, he's still with the wedding
              party.  And he asked me to get
              something he needs real badly from
              his room...  ?

     The boy swallows hard.

                    JULIANNE
              He's in 1526.  If you could just
              let me ha...

                    BOY
              See that woman?

     Not only does Julianne see her.  The woman is looking back, while
     she's talking to her customer.  Not a pleasant look.

                    BOY
              She said, if I ever pull a stunt
              like that again...

                    JULIANNE
              You'll lose your job...

                    BOY
              ... tear my pecker off.  Is what
              she said.

     INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - TWILIGHT

     An elevator OPENS, revealing Julianne, carrying a gym bag.  She
     looks down the long hallway, sees a maid's cart.  Heads the other
     way, briskly, to...

     ... a small ALCOVE.  Opens the gym bag, pulling out a bath towel.
     Begins to yank her top up OVER her head...

     ANGLE... the young MAID now pushing her cart down the hall, wheels
     SQUEAKING, and from nowhere...

     ... Julianne DARTS into her path, barely covered by the towel held
     tight across her, she is grinning, blushing.

                    JULIANNE
              Help me!

     The maid can only blink.

                    JULIANNE
              I locked myself out, 1526, please
              hurry!!

     And looks frantically up the hall, mortified that any moment a
     stranger could happen upon her predicament.  Her eyes dart back to
     the maid.  PLEASE.  The maid just stares.  Stares.

                    JULIANNE
              Uno-cinco-does-ses.

     Oh.

     INT.  MICHAEL'S ROOM - TWILIGHT

     Julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically.  No worries
     about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn
     everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated.
     She's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel,
     looking, looking...

     There it is.  The corner of his LAPTOP sticking out from beneath a
     discarded bedspread.  She SNATCHES it up, OPENS it, sets it on the
     cluttered desk, and...

     ... stops.  There are wallet-sized SNAPSHOTS of Kimmy.  Some alone.
     Some as a little girl.  Some with Michael.  And next to them...

     ... the plastic fold-out wallet inset.  That he has not yet quite
     rearranged.  So she picks it up.  Leafs through, until she finds
     what she was praying would be there...

     ... Julianne grinning.  Michael's arm around her.  On the deck of a
     boat.  They have drinks in their hands.  Happiness in their eyes.

     And she stares at it.  Jesus, God, how long has he carried this
     around?  She flips through further, all the rest have her in them.
     Maybe half a dozen.  Her heart is throbbing.  Her eyes are damp.

     Back to the one on the boat.  She slips it from the plastic window.
     Holds it.  Then, gently...

     ... puts it back where it belongs.  PUNCHES up the goddamn laptop.
     This is it, girl!  Do or die.

                    JULIANNE
                   (murmurs)
              You wouldn't change your
              password, would you?  You
              never change anything.

     Those words make her bite her lip.  Damn, I'm becoming a senti-
     mental slob.  TYPES in...

                    JULIANNE
                   (murmurs)
              Shoeless... Joe.

     Yes!  We're in!  Punching keys.  Letters flying across the screen.
     Okay, we're ready.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
                   (reads as she types)
              Mike.  I hate this downsizing
              shit as much as you do.  But I
              know this can't become as a
              complete surprise...

     INT.  BEACH CLUB CARD ROOM - EVENING

     Through the window, the wedding party barbecue has extended into
     night.  Lanterns, music, lots more food, lots more drinks.  In the
     distance, on the sand, Michael is slowdancing with Kimmy.  Some-
     where nearby, the soft CLICKING of keys.  We PULL BACK to see...

     ... a small clubby room.  Books, leather, polished woods.  Only
     two people here.  Walter, looking on stony-faced, as a determined
     Julianne grimly "struggles" to "find" what she's looking for in
     Michael's laptop.  And then...

     ... she stops typing.  Looks at the text on the screen.  Her eyes
     sharpen as she "reads" what Walter can't see.  It's an Oscar
     performance for our desperate girl.  She turns the screen around...

                    WALTER
                   (reads)
              Mike.  I hate this downsizing...

     He reads.  Reads.  Reads.  All the air comes out of him.

                    WALTER
                   (softly)
              And Kimmy doesn't know.

     She shakes her head.  Nope.  No way.

                    WALTER
                   (signs)
              I'll tell her I've reconsidered.

     She nods, gravely.  Right.  He looks in her eyes.

                    WALTER
              You're a smart girl, Jules.

     She forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude.  But Walter isn't
     smiling at all.

                    WALTER
              Wish my daughter.  Bad your
              guts.

     INT.  CHARLES TROTTER'S BAR - NIGHT

     The hot saloon in Chinatown.  Upscale, downscale, jammed, Michael
     and Kimmy at a small table in a far corner.  CLOSE on them...

                    MICHAEL
              Sure you're okay?

     She looks really scared.  Turns her drink in her hand.  Looking
     down at it.

                    MICHAEL
              It's not just a gag, huh?

                    KIMMY
              No, it's, uh... a real big favor.

     He takes her hand, tenderly.

                    MICHAEL
              I wish you'd just... come out
              with it.  I mean why are we
              waiting for Jules?

     She smiles up at him.  The best she can.

                    KIMMY
              Moral support.

     She loves him so much, and she is sick with worry.

                    KIMMY
              What's good of having a big
              sister, if she...

     Stops.  Gestures with her eyes.  Because her big sister has just
     entered...

     ... looking fabulous.  Julianne wears a long sleek sarong, slightly
     see-through.  Her hair is bound up with silver pins.  As she moves
     through the room toward us, we can see that, for once, her make-up
     is flawless, understated.  When she arrives at the table...

     ... Michael is beaming, admiringly.  He stands up.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Wow and wow.  You have a date,
              after this?

                    JULIANNE
              Never can tell.

     He holds her chair.  She exchanges an intimate smile with the
     anxious Kim.

                    MICHAEL
              You make me think of that song,
              we used to...

     And he starts humming.  The song is, "The Way You Look Tonight."

                    MICHAEL
                   (singing)
              Someday.  When I'm awfully low...

     They sit.  He looks from Julianne to his bride.

                    MICHAEL
              Okay, kid.  You're on.

     Kim's eyes flick to Julianne, who nods, supportively.  The kid
     takes a breath.

                    KIMMY
              It's really my father.  Who
              needs the favor.

     His face sort of comes to a stop.  Nothing she can read, yet.  He
     nods, yeah...?

                    KIMMY
              He's... he's reorganizing some of
              the divisions of the company...

     His eyes flick to Julianne.  She looks down.

                    MICHAEL
                   (quiet)
              He never mentioned that.  Neither
              did y...

                    KIMMY
                   (blurting)
              ... and public relations is a big
              problem area for him.

     She can see it now.  In his eyes.  She just can't tell how bad.

                    KIMMY
              He needs someone incredible,
              someone really close, who he
              can trust...

                    MICHAEL
              Like family, huh?

     So quiet.  So cold.  She is terrified.

                    KIMMY
              It would only be, maybe, six
              months? Or three or four? It
              would mean so much to him...

                    MICHAEL
              To him.

     She swallows.  Straightens her spine.

                    KIMMY
              And to m...

                    MICHAEL
                   (sharp, to Julianne)
              ... and you knew about this.

     Real quiet.  Against the noise of this place.

                    JULIANNE
              I think you ought to listen to
              her, Michael.  This is her life,
              too.

     Just the thing.  To bring that anger near the surface.  He turns
     to Kim...

                    MICHAEL
              Well, which is it?

     A demand.  Sharp.  Accusing.  She doesn't like that...

                    MICHAEL
              You gonna tell me Daddy thought
              this one up? All of a sudden, I'm
              the only jerk alive who can help
              him deal with the press?

     She's trapped.  Angry, scared.  A deer in headlights.

                    MICHAEL
              Why don't you start being honest
              for one fucking sec...

                    JULIANNE
              Michael!!

                    KIMMY
                   (near tears)
              I am honest!

     Silence.

                    KIMMY
             All of a sudden, I'm supposed to
             drop out of school, forget my
             family, forget my career, forget
             all the plans I had for my life...

                    MICHAEL
              Well, forgive me for screwing up
              your plans!

     He can't even believe he's hearing this.

                    MICHAEL
              I'm sure glad I'm hearing all
              this now, before it's too late!

                    KIMMY
              What is that sup...

                    MICHAEL
              And what am I supposed to do with
              my life, huh? I am 28 years old!
              I work in a low-paying, low-status,
              zero-respect job which,
              unfortunately, I happen to fucking
              love.  How inconvenient.

     Shrugs.

                    MICHAEL
              No problem.  A little bullshit
              about Daddy's "needs," and presto,
              I'm a lap dog in high society.

                    JULIANNE
                   (softly)
              Michael, it sounds like a
              wonderful opportun...

                    MICHAEL
                   (whips around)
              Does it, really? How come you
              never took some sell-out
              establishment job? You had plenty
              of chances!

     Glares in her eyes.

                    MICHAEL
              I'll tell you why.  Because that
              isn't you.  And it isn't me,
              either!  We're the same person!

     Back to Kim...

                    MICHAEL
              What a sweet little picture.  Mommy
              and Daddy aren't losing a daughter,
              they're gaining a eunuch!

                    KIMMY
              Well, if that's the way you f...

                    MICHAEL
              Damn straight, it's how I feel!
              What's their wedding gift, a little
              gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"?
              Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?

     She's crying now.  Real tears on her face.

                    MICHAEL
              Great!  Tears!  The big equalizer.
              You wait till two days before the
              wedding to drop this on me, and
              I'm just supposed to roll over and
              drool!

     She is sobbing now.  She can't help herself.  Which makes him
     totally crazy.  He jumps up.

                    MICHAEL
              Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist
              asshole, and you're well rid of m...

                    KIMMY
              MICHAEL!!

     A wrenching cry from her heart.  It stops him cold.  And before
     Julianne's astonished eyes, Kimmy reaches out a trembling hand...

                    KIMMY
              Michael, you are so...

     Choking back the sobs.

                    KIMMY
              ... so right.  And I am so very
              wrong.

     Michael blinks.  Julianne blinks.  For different reasons.

                    KIMMY
              We can't go down two roads.  And
              still be together.

     Her fingers stretch, beckoning.

                    JULIANNE
              Uh, Kimmy...?

                    KIMMY
                   (ignores her)
              We settled this.  And I reneged.
              That wasn't fair.

     Please, please, take my hand.

                    KIMMY
              You have to forgive me, and forget
              this ever happened...

     People are watching, staring.  These two see only each other.

                    KIMMY
              ... or I'll die.

     A frozen, forever moment.  He steps to her...

     ... LIFTS her up in his arms.  Into the deepest, most heartfelt
     KISS.  And as she clings to him, people begins to APPLAUD, and
     whistle, and laugh.

     Julianne.  In her pretty dress.  Closes her eyes.

     INT.JULIANNE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Julianne in her nightshirt, her back to us, sobbing into her
     cellular as she paces the room...

                    JULIANNE
              ... see that's what I never
              counted on! I never heard of
              a brilliant moron before!

     We CLOSE as she WHIPS around, startling us with her grotesque day-
     glo PURPLE face mask.  The green was better.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean, the little twerp
              GROVELED!!

     Losing it.  We know the drill.

                    JULIANNE
              SHE IS SO WRONG FOR HIM!

     Clutching the phone.

                    JULIANNE
              Michael and I are the same person!
              Self-absorbed and imperfect and
              vaguely loveable! We deserve
              each other!

     Tears are flowing.  Which, over this mask, is not a pretty sight.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm out of hope, I'm out of sneaky
              ideas, I'm at the end of my
              rapidly-fraying hysterical little
              rope!  Help m...

     She TRIPS over an open suitcase, and DISAPPEARS from frame.  The
     THUD is slightly alarming.

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              God, I hate this hotel.

     HOLD.  On nothing is particular.

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              And I hate talking to your machine!

     INT. JULIANNE'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

     REAR VIEW of Julianne asleep on the floor, sunlight streaming in.
     A soft knocking on a door, somewhere nearby.  She barely stirs.
     The knock becomes a strong RAPPING, and she fights for conscious-
     ness.  Her back still to us, she...

     ... rises, STUMBLES to the door, which is now pulsing with an
     insistent POUNDING, and THROWS it OPEN, as we SNAP to...

     REVERSE ANGLE... CLOSE on Julianne's face, still encased in a now-
     decomposing PURPLE MASK, her eyes SPRINGING wide, she SCREAMS in
     shock, and we SNAP BACK to...

     ORIGINAL ANGLE... Digger, watching impassively at the high-strung
     SHRIEK.  In the silence that follows...

                    DIGGER
              You stole my line.

     He touches his face, and she realizes!

                    JULIANNE
              Oh, shit!

     Starts CLAWING at the overripe mask, but he grabs her wrists.

                    DIGGER
              Chill.  We don't want your face
              coming off with it.

                    JULIANNE
              Chill?  Since when do you say
              ch...

                    DIGGER
              When I'm talking to children.

     She looks in his eyes.  Realizing at last.

                    JULIANNE
              You flew all the way h...

                    DIGGER
              I noticed.  I'm on the noon back.
              We have this thing with George's
              family in the Hamptons.

                    JULIANNE
                   (soft)
              You're butting in.

     He still holds her wrists.  She brings one of his hands to her
     lips.  Kisses his knuckles.

                    JULIANNE
                   (softer)
              I really resent this.

     INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

     Julianne seated at the sink, staring into the mirror, as Digger
     gently applies soup, cloth and water to easing away the mask.  A
     paleontologist restoring a Bronze Age artifact.  By the side of the
     half-filled sink, rests her plugged-in curling iron.

                    JULIANNE
              What I mean, when I say annoyingly
              perfect, is that there is nothing
              annoying about her perfection.
              It is vulnerable and endearing.
              And that is annoying as shit.

                    DIGGER
              You like her.

                    JULIANNE
              If I didn't have to hate her, I'd
              adore her.

     She looks up at him and WINCES, as the movement makes him scrape
     her face.  He's sorry.

                    JULIANNE
              Last night, she was crying, these
              big, real tears, when she thought
              she'd lost him.  It was like there
              was a knife in her heart...

     Looking in his eyes.  Needs him to hear.

                    JULIANNE
              ... and I put it there.  I hated
              myself, I grieved for her, I
              couldn't enjoy one second of it!
              And then, when it didn't work...

     Can you believe this?

                    JULIANNE
              I was devastated.

                    DIGGER
                   (softly)
              Go figure you.

                     JULIANNE
              Because I realized.  When I see
              him say "I do," that knife will
              be in my heart.  And it will be
              there every...

     She holds his wrists now.  To stop him.  To plead for
     understanding.  Forgiveness.

                    JULIANNE
              ... every time I think of him,
              forever, which could be a lot.

     She almost choked on that last part.  So she composes herself.

                    JULIANNE
              You watch a guy caress his
              girlfriend's butt.  You see an
              Old Spice commercial.  Sentimental
              moments are everywhere, when
              you're in the right frame of mind.

     She swallows hard.  Fights for a grip on her determination.

                    JULIANNE
              There are 18,250 nights in the
              next 50 years...

                    DIGGER
              You've been working on this, huh?

                    JULIANNE
              ... and having "done the right
              thing" will only really be
              comforting, oh, maybe, five,
              six times.

     She sets her jaw.

                    JULIANNE
              This is my whole life's happiness.
              I have to be ruthless.

                    DIGGER
                   (quietly)
              And you believe that.

                    JULIANNE
                    (unconvincing)
              Sure.

     His eyes are gentle and merciless at once.  No way she gets off
     this hook.

                    JULIANNE
              He was in love with me every day
              for nine years.  I can make him
              happier than she can.

                    DIGGER
              It's not his happiness you're
              feeling guilty about...

                    JULIANNE
                   (proudly)
              I don't know the meaning of the
              word guilt!

                    DIGGER
              Impressive.

                    JULIANNE
              I am breaking her heart in the short
              run, but doing her a gigantic favor!
              She would be miserable tagging
              along after this insensitive doofus!

                    DIGGER
              The man you love.

                    JULIANNE
              Beyond reason.  The feminist
              warrior will rise up in this kid,
              and she'll be standing over his
              sleeping form with a butcher
              knife, selecting from a short
              list of body parts!

                    DIGGER
              Someday she'll thank you.

                    JULIANNE
              Let's not get carried away.

     And the defenses drain from her clay-ravaged features.  The real
     Julianne is glimpsed.

                    JULIANNE
              I'd settle for.  Someday, I'll
              forgive myself.

     For...?

                    JULIANNE
              For doing this terrible thing.

     Her eyes tear up.

                    JULIANNE
              Which, by the way, I can't
              figure out how to do.

     As the tears fall, he wipes at them, discovering...

                    DIGGER
              Jesus.  You're supposed to take
              your make-up off before you
              apply the m...

                    JULIANNE
              I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY
              GRIEF!

     Oh.

                    JULIANNE
              Guess what I brushed my teeth
              with last night?

     He thinks about this.  Following her eyes to the toiletries kit, he
     browses for a moment...

                    DIGGER
              Zit cream?

                    JULIANNE
              I wish.

                    DIGGER
              Neosporin?

                    JULIANNE
              Try less appropriate.

                    DIGGER
              Ben Gay.

                    JULIANNE
              That was Thursday.

     He stops on that note.

                    DIGGER
              Elmer's Glue?

                    JULIANNE
              DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING
              A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!

     She's hysterical.

                    DIGGER
              I give.

                    JULIANNE
              I can't even say it.

     Now.  He's curious.

                    JULIANNE
              A hint.  The first word is
              "Preparation." Then comes a
              letter of the alphabet,
              perilously close to G.

     She reaches to test her curling iron, BURNS her finger, SHIT!
     KNOCKING the appliance into the half-filled sink.  She LUNGES for
     it, and a terrified Digger GRASPS her arm...

                    DIGGER
              Considering the circumstances,
              I'm not wholly against suicide...

     Huh?

                    DIGGER
              Just not by electrocution in
              front of me!

     Oh.

                    DIGGER
              I've got this noon flight.

     He reaches to pull the plug from the wall, and now she LUNGES to
     grab his arm, slipping, her face falling forward, stopping an inch
     above the sink.

                    JULIANNE
              How do you know you can touch
              that plug? Are you a licensed
              contractor?

                    DIGGER
              What do you suggest?

     She looks from the plug down the cord, to the submerged curling
     iron.  And back.

                    JULIANNE
              Maybe they just seal off this
              room.  They have others.

     He's staring at her.  Sweet, but intense.

                    DIGGER
              I didn't mean about that.

     Oh.  Again.

                    JULIANNE
              If I hear the words "tell the
              truth," or any paraphrase thereof,
              I dive into the sink and pull you
              with me.

     Looking at her.  Looking at her.

                    DIGGER
              Let's go meet Michael.  I'll
              wait downstairs.

     INT.  ARMANI - MORNING

     Julianne has cleaned up pretty good.  She sits with Digger on a
     fashion-fabric sofa.  They are side-by-side, studying something
     with equal concentration.  And slight concern.

                    DIGGER
              I suppose it's too late to
              start over.

                    JULIANNE
              It's too late to start over.

     PULL BACK to reveal Michael in his wedding tux, submitting to a
     final fitting from a stylish fitter.

                    MICHAEL
              You guys are heartless, my
              bride picked this out.

                    JULIANNE
              Like I said, dazzling.

                    DIGGER
              Is she going to dress you
              every day?

     Michael smiles over.  Digger smiles back.  They live each other.

                    MICHAEL
              Yeah, it's in the contract.

                    DIGGER
                   (softly)
              Well, then, I'll take it up
              with her.

     Michael motions, okay, c'mon over.  Digger rises, goes to Michael,
     the fitter steps back as Digger shows him...

                    DIGGER
              The cut here, here... this
              line...

     Fingers lightly traveling over the lapel, the side-stitching, the
     cloth straight down the spine...

                    DIGGER
              ... trouser width, this is all
              classic.  Which means safe,
              something I'd wear.

                    MICHAEL
              I should look different.

                    DIGGER
              You should look like you
              dressed yourself.

     Yes? Michael's grin is back.  Playful and friendly.

                    MICHAEL
              And I'm supposed to respect
              your fashion tips, because
              you're what, a New Yorker?

                    DIGGER
                   (quiet smile)
              Something like that.

     Julianne loves that the boy are getting on.

                    MICHAEL
                   (means this)
              Long trip.  Pretty nice of you
              to come.

                    DIGGER
              Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted
              to meet the one that got away.

     Said so naturally.  That embarrasses Michael, who looks down, his
     smile suddenly awkward.

                    DIGGER
              What?

                    MICHAEL
              I'm just glad someone finally put
              this thing in its proper perspective.

     Steals a glance at Julianne.  She rolls her eyes.  What a goofball,
     my outrageous friend.

                    MICHAEL
                   (to Digger)
              Stay, huh?

                    DIGGER
              I honestly wish I could...

                    MICHAEL
              I'll call George's parents.
              Tell them I need a best man who
              actually looks after me.

     Julianne comes over.

                    JULIANNE
                   (softly)
              They'd say that's my job.

     She runs her hands over his jacket, smoothing it everywhere.  With
     tenderness that approaches transparency.  Glances back at Digger...

                    JULIANNE
              I'll take it home from here.

     Pinches Michael's ear.  Looks in his eyes.

                    DIGGER
              Two words.

                    JULIANNE
              Major.  Dish.

                    DIGGER
              Manicure...

     She looks down.  Michael's nails are unclipped, with layers of
     impacted dirt.  She touches his fingertips, a little more softly
     than she may have intended.

                    DIGGER
              Fly.

     Everyone looks down.  She ZIPS Michael up.

                    MICHAEL
                   (to Digger)
              You don't miss much.

                    DIGGER
              Part of being a New Yorker.

     INT.  HAIR SALON - MORNING

     Cutting edge salon.  Loud, PULSING MUSIC.  Digger and Michael in
     adjacent chairs, heads back, each smoking impressive cigars as
     their hair is styled.  Digger's stylist is a hot trashy female.
     Michael's is a tall, flamboyant male in a day-glo vest.

     Each man has one hand soaking, the other being worked on by a
     manicurist, so Julianne goes from one to the other, removing their
     cigars so they can exhale.  A seraglio feel to the way she does
     this.

     Now she's arguing with Michael's stork-like stylist.  We can't hear
     over the music, but she keeps tugging on Michael's hair, pretty
     passionate about her point of view.  Suddenly, she GRABS the
     scissors to do it herself, and Michael...

     ... BOLTS out of the chair.  WHOA!

     EXT.  O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY

     Skycaps, guests of impatient travelers, a bus offloading forty
     Japanese tourists.  A taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb.  Out
     jumps...

     Michael.  Opening the door for Digger and Julianne.  Digger says
     something, Michael gives him a strong HUG.  Julianne raises one
     finger to Michael, back in a second.  Leads Digger off by the hand.

     CLOSE on them now.  Alone in the throng.

                    JULIANNE
              Bye, handsome.

     Digger just stares at her.  Those maddening judgemental eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              You're going to say it, aren't
              you?

                    DIGGER
              Tell him you love him.  With
              all your heart.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm taking my next book to
              Viking.

                     DIGGER
              Tell him you've loved him for
              nine years, but you were afraid
              to realize it.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm moving this book to Viking.

                    DIGGER
              Tell him you're afraid of love.
              Afraid of needing.

                    JULIANNE
              Needing.

                    DIGGER
              To belong to someone.

     He touches her hair.

                    DIGGER
              We all do, beautiful.  I'm sorry
              about that.

     Staring in her eyes.  Even Julianne has run out of words.

                    DIGGER
              Tell him you know this is the
              worst, dumbest, cruelest moment
              to do this to him.  But there
              it is, and he has to choose.

                    JULIANNE
              And what will he do?

     Digger isn't smiling.  His voice low, beneath the crowd...

                    DIGGER
              He'll choose Kim.  You'll stand
              by her at her wedding.  You'll
              kiss him good-bye.  And you'll
              go home.

     He holds up one finger.  Almost touching her nose.

                    DIGGER
              This is what you've come to do.
              Now do it.

     Wow.  She looks frightened and moved, all at the same time.  She
     kisses him on the lips.

     And walks away.  He watches her go through the crowd.  Take
     Michael's hand.  Lead him back toward the taxi.

     EXT.  SKYLINE CRUISE BOAT - DAY

     The skyline of Chicago moves past us.  Slowly.  The NBC Tower,
     Cityfront Center...

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Big weddings are so strange.

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              You keep saying that.

     Up ahead, the Wrigley Building draws closer...

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Kim has all this stuff to do,
              I hardly see her.

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              Well, you've got the rest of
              your lives.

     REVERSE ANGLE... they lean on the rail of a cruise boat, easing down
     the Chicago River.  Wind-blown.  Close together.

                    JULIANNE
              Getting your bed made.  Every
              day.

     They smile at each other.  Seem so comfortable together.

                    JULIANNE
              You miss her, huh?

                    MICHAEL
              No.  I've got you.

     She nods.  That you have.  Staring in her eyes...

                    MICHAEL
              Don't you throw up on boat?

                    JULIANNE
              If you like.

     And she LURCHES over the railing, emitting a BARRAGE of incredibly
     disgusting sounds, her feet FLAILING in mid-air.  He laughs, as he
     pulls her back down to the deck.  Of course, it was all a joke.  He
     brushes back her hair.  Sighs.  Stares.

                    MICHAEL
              I've been thinking a lot the
              last couple days.  About us,
              actually.

                    JULIANNE
                   (casual)
              Have you.

     He has.

                    JULIANNE
              Well.  There's a lot of memories
              to choose from...

                    MICHAEL
              It's more than that.

     That tightens her throat pretty good.  When she tries to speak, out
     comes a dry CROAK that makes him laugh again.  Softer, this time.

                    MICHAEL
              I mean, it's embarrassing to
              say it this way, but...

     He stops.  Her eyes WIDEN in a burlesque of anticipation.  So he
     smiles.  She knows how to put him at ease.

                    MICHAEL
              You've sort of been... y'know,
              the woman in my life.

                    JULIANNE
                   (straight back)
              You've been the man in mine.

     Passing under the Michigan Avenue Bridge.  No one knows quite what
     to say.

                    MICHAEL
              And I was thinking this could be
              our last time.  Alone.  Together.
              You know?

                    JULIANNE
              Except for the hot affairs we'll
              have twice a year.

                    MICHAEL
              Except for that.

     She's smiling so easily.  Who would guess her stomach is double-
     knotted.

                    MICHAEL
              I can hardly wait for your
              wedding.

                    JULIANNE
              Me either.

     She watches his surprise.

                    MICHAEL
              Boy, I never thought I'd hear you
              say that.  Can I come?

     She holds herself together.  Real soft with...

                    JULIANNE
              I couldn't have it without you.

     He's glad to hear that.  And then...

                    MICHAEL
              It's normal to have... second
              thoughts, huh? To be scared.

     Is this a change of direction? Or is it the direction she's been
     praying for.

                    JULIANNE
              I wouldn't know.  I never had
              that many first thoughts.

                    MICHAEL
              I mean, you commit to a wedding.
              And then it seems like... this...
              momentum, you know?  You forget
              you... chose it.

     She nods.  Understands.

                    MICHAEL
              You and I.  I mean, in all our
              relationships with other people...
              We didn't use the word "love"
              a lot, did we?

     We didn't.

                    MICHAEL
              Kimmy says.  When you love someone.
              You say it, you say it out loud.
              Right now.  Or the moment...

     Long beat.

                    MICHAEL
              ... passes you by, yeah.  She's a
              smart girl.

     Off in distance, the Centennial Fountain SHOOTS an eight-foot JET
     of water across the river.  For Michael and Julianne it goes
     unnoticed.

                    MICHAEL
              We don't have a song.

     Hmm?

                    MICHAEL
              Kimmy and I.  We don't have a song.
              Is that a bad sign?

     All Julianne can do is shrug.  Then...

                    MICHAEL
                   (sings, softly)
              Someday, when I'm awfully low...
                And the world is cold...

     She doesn't want to cry.  So she puts all the strength she has into
     fighting it back.

                    MICHAEL
                   (sings)
              I will feel a glow just Thinking of you...
                And the way you look.  Tonight.

     He stops.  Smiles that sweet, boyish smile.

                    MICHAEL
              Dance card filled?

                    JULIANNE
              I'll check.  I have it on
              powerbook, these days.

     He holds up his arms.  And she moves into them.  He begins to dance
     with her, turning so slowly.  And, yes, people are watching.

                    MICHAEL
                       (sings in her ear)
              With each word, your tenderness grows,
                Tearing my fears apart...

     She holds him closer.  Bites her lip.

                    MICHAEL
                   (sings)
              And that laugh
                That wrinkles your nose,
              Touches my foolish heart.

     He stops.  He looks at her.  She's still in his arms.

                    MICHAEL
              Where did we first hear th...

                    JULIANNE
                     (straight back)
              The night we met.

     Right to his eyes...

                    JULIANNE
              The night we fell in love.

     He doesn't know what to do with that.

                    MICHAEL
              So we heard it... like, right
              that... that first...

                    JULIANNE
              We danced to it.  Just like this.

     Just like this.  A long beat.  And he has to say...

                    MICHAEL
              I won't lose you, will I?

     Her eyes close.  Then open.  Utterly lost in his.

                    JULIANNE
              No.  Because I won't let you.

     INT.  WALLACE ENTERPRISES - DAY

     Julianne in crisp chalk-stripe trousers and a buttoned-up dress
     shirt.  Her coat slung over her shoulder, she wanders through
     the Saturday-deserted office space.  Desks, cubicles, monitors,
     silent.  A row of executive offices standing empty, waiting for
     the custodian.  Turning a corner, we hear...

     ... life, at the end of the hallway.  A grand conference room with a
     glass wall.  Walter, in shirtsleeves, running a strategy meeting
     for five.  DEIDRE, his personal secretary, clicking every word into
     her laptop at warp speed.  Walter sees Julianne through the glass.
     A comic take of pleased surprise.  He comes out to greet her...

                    WALTER
              I thought Michael was picking
              me up.

                    JULIANNE
              I told him, get the important
              stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect
              the inconsequentials.

     Meaning, you.  They smile at each other.  Then...

                    WALTER
              Kim said, when he turned down
              the job, there was no friction.

     Julianne thinks back.

                    JULIANNE
              Friction.  No.

     He smiles at her line reading.  But his mind is always probing.

                    WALTER
              I haven't caused... a problem,
              have I?

                    JULIANNE
              Nobody has.  So far.

     Her bright grin.  His eyes linger on it.

                    WALTER
              Well, you're a little early...

                    JULIANNE
              I need to make some calls.
              Could I use... your office?

     INT.  WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Julianne enters the spacious corner office, high above the city.
     Closes the door, quietly, behind her.  So anxious, she is
     practically hyperventilating.  She goes, slowly to the vacant
     cherrywood desk.  Its computer and monitor standing silent.  She
     is stalking it, like a deadly animal.  And then.  She is there.

     Talking to herself, her own desperate support network...

                    JULIANNE
                   (softly)
              You can do this.

     Sacred, filled with doubt and conflict.  Her hands clutch at each
     other.  Then, one flicks out.  And the computer goes ON.  The
     screen GLOWS.  Waits for her.  Her mouth is sand, her stomach
     water.  She pulls the paper from her pocket...

     ... looks at it.  Looks to the monitor.  And begins.  To type...

                    JULIANNE
                   (mumbling to herself)
              E-mail address.  To Ben Isaacson,
              Senior Editor, Sports Illustrated,
              from... Walter Wallace.

     And stops.  Her heart is thumping.

                    JULIANNE
              See, you can do it.  It's easy.

     Doesn't look easy.  Licks her lips.

                    JULIANNE
              You do it fast, it's over.  Like
              it never happened.

     She sits.  And recites as she types...

                    JULIANNE
              Ben.  I need a favor.

     Here we go.  This is it.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
              My daughter's every happiness.
              And my wife's.  And, least of
              all, my own, are in your hands.

     Nods, okay.  Breathing hard.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
              Knowing you value our friendship,
              and the... cooperative
              relationship between our companies...
              I am hopeful of your help.

     Touch, that.  Thinks.  It has to be.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
              I have offered Mike O'Neal, my
              new son-in-law, a great opportunity
              in my company.  This would also
              enable my daughter to settle in
              Chicago, near us, and pursue her
              dreams and plans.

     Almost there.  Almost.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
              To his own detriment, as well
              as ours, Michael will not accept
              our offer.  While he works for you.

     She stands up.  Stares at the screen.  Walks away.  Walks back.
     Still standing, types...

                    JULIANNE
              My daughter joins me in this
              plea for your cooperation and
              discretion.

     Is there a SOUND?  Outside the door.  She HOVERS over the ESCAPE
     key.  Waits.  Waits.  Silence.  Types...

                    JULIANNE
              With gratitude.  For your
              understanding.  Walter.

     She hits a KEY.  The screen goes BLANK.  The computer asks... DO
     YOU WISH TO SEND?  She tells the computer...

                    JULIANNE
              Are you crazy?  Get him fired?

     Types NO.  The computer asks HOLD FOR LATER? And she types YES.

                    JULIANNE
              Just till tonight when I bring
              him back.  To look for...

     She glances to her huge bag.  Rummages through, pulling out a manila
     folder.  Lays it by the blank computer.  Fans out a few pages in a
     natural, disorderly way.  Takes a step back...

     And stares.  Struck to her gut.  But when she has done.

     INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Walter alone with Deidre now, signing a stack of documents, as she
     efficiently places one after another before him.  When he glances up,
     he sees Julianne wandering the halls.  Stands, tells his secretary...

                    WALTER
                   (going through stack)
              Off to rehearsal.  Send out this,
              and this, not this, this, and...
              that's it.

     Slips on his coat.  Oh... and by the way...

                    WALTER
              I'm holding four or five E-mails
              I wrote over lunch...

     On his way through the door...

                    WALTER
              Send 'em out.

     INT.  CHAPEL, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY

     Julianne and Walter enter the rear of a striking Gothic CHAPEL,
     pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows.  We now
     see the full effect of her outfit, a man's-style chalk stripe SUIT,
     tailored to fit her body, set off by a bold silk tie.  Solid
     dynamite.  She hangs back, while Walter proceeds down the vaulted
     nave toward...

     ... Michael, Kimmy, Isabelle and Joe, who stand casually joking by
     the altar.  Scattered around are assorted groomsmen, ushers, an
     obvious flowergirl.  Coming toward us, up the aisle...

     ... the MINISTER, early 40s, lean and quite attractive.  Mandy is
     HANGING on his arm, pressing her body against him as they walk,
     murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear.  He's a really good
     sport, and really uncomfortable.  Sammy is walking backwards,
     right in front of them, DROPS her bag, and BENDS to retrieve it, as
     if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display.

     Julianne is so lost in her own anxiety, she doesn't even notice,
     until...

                    MANDY
              Reverend Dyer, this is
              Kimberly's somewhat butch
              maid of honor...

                    SAMMY
              ... Mr. Julianne Potter,
              prominent New York drag queen.

     Today, the girls' voices are charmingly musically Southern, with
     none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower.  The minister
     extends his hand...

                    MINISTER
              Billy Dyer, Julianne.  And I
              love the suit.

     She shakes his hand, smiles graciously, but her eyes flick to
     Michael, now approaching up the aisle.  The girls lead the minister
     away.  Michael arrives.  Looks her up and down.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Takes me back.

                    JULIANNE
              Well.

     She smiles.  One that glows a little.

                    JULIANNE
              You sang the song.  Least I
              could do was wear the outfit.

     He nods.

                    MICHAEL
              Except now you're better-
              looking.

     Oh, yeah?  Yes, ma'am.  As she loses herself in his eyes...

                    MICHAEL
              I got the ring.

     He pulls the box from his pocket.  Somewhere, an ORGAN sounds.  And
     as he is about to hand her the box...

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (sing)
              Swi-i-ng low-ow-ow...
                 Wee-ee-eet Char-i-ot...

     Such exquisite two-part harmony, Michael stops to watch.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (sing)
              Comin', to car-ryyy
                 Me ho-o-o-me...

     It is amazing.  Soulful vengeful sluts.  He is enthralled.  Julianne
     simply impatient.  She wants his attention.

                    JULIANNE
              No accents today.

                    MICHAEL
              Yeah, Kim told me they were
              giving you their Dueling
              Scarlet's act.  Actually,
              they're sophomores at Juilliard.

     She takes the box from his hand.  Opens it, as the singing CONTINUES
     throughout.  The ring is delicate hammered gold.  One of a kind.

                    MICHAEL
              Will she like it?

                    JULIANNE
                   (whisper)
              Yes.

     She's staring at the ring.

                    KIMMY (O.S.)
              My groom-person!  Your family
              needs you!

     His master's voice.  He gives Julianne a smile.  And goes.  She's
     left with the box.

     Gazes at the ring.  Lifts it out.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (O.S., singing)
              Well, I look over yon-der,
                 And what did I see-ee-ee?

     Slips it on her left hand.  Ring finger.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (O.S., singing)
              Comin too car-ryyy.
                 Me ho-o-ome...

     Touches it.  Turns it on her finger.  So many emotions.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (O.S., singing)
              It was a hand.  Of a-a-angels.
                 Coming' for me-e-ee...

     Tries to pull it off.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (O.S., singing)
              Comin' for to carry me home.

     It won't come.  Not even close.

     INT.  CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a bowl filled with squares of butter.  HEAR the butt of
     conversation from a rowdy, friendly joint.  Julianne's right hand
     REACHES to the bowl, fingers trace the rim innocently, then...

     ... SLIDE the bowl into Julianne's lap beneath the table.  Her right
     hand MASSAGES all the butter into a gooey revolving mess.  We can
     pick out familiar voices now, family in distance, the twins closer.
     As, hidden from view, Julianne brings...

     ... her left hand from her pocket.  Yep.  The ring is still there.
     The finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it
     off.  And as APPLAUSE surrounds us, Julianne...

     PLUNGES her ring finger into the morass of grease, frantically
     TEARING at the ring, butter SPLURGING on her pants, everywhere, as
     we PULL BACK to see...

     ... the long table covered with butcher paper, the family at the far
     end, the twins down here with us, a mug of beer for each place, as
     team of waiters with heaping platters of CRABS, which they...

     ... FLING across the butcher paper, as APPLAUSE continues from
     everyone but Julianne, who still struggles secretly.  As the waiters
     set huge wooden MALLETS in front of each guest, Joe O'Neal rises,
     POUNDS the table with his mallet for attention.

                    JOE
              Like to welcome ever'body to
              our little rehearsal supper...

     He COUGHS, unaccustomed to public speaking.  Walter and Isabelle
     clap and call out support.  So Joe lifts his mallet...

                    JOE
              Okay, everyone stand up!

     And everyone does.  With one exception.  Trapped.  She JAMS her
     left hand in her coat pocket, SMEARS her right palm sort of clean
     on the underside of the table, GRABS her mallet and JUMPS UP.

                    JOE
              To the bride, uh, goes the
              honor... of cracking the first
              crab!

     Everyone applauses by banging their mallets.  Joe RAISES his high.
     Everybody imitates.

                    KIMMY
              But first, a toast!

     And everybody SNATCHES up their beers with their left hands, as
     Julianne DROPS her mallet with a HORRIFIC CRASH, grabbing her beer,
     looking up to...

                    JULIANNE
                   (on the spot)
              I'm right-handed.

     A hugely embarrassing half-second.  Bailed out by...

                    KIMMY
              To our host, my cuddly Papa
              Joe.

     All turns.

                    KIMMY
              Who taught me to play "Blue
              Hawaii." On my nose.

     With a look at Julianne, Kim sets down her mallet gently, and
     performs a nasal HUM of the tropical standard, strikingly her nostril
     repeatedly for vibrato.  It is charming, and everybody watches.

     INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM - LATER

     CLOSE on an actual, living, if geriatric, LION.  He blinks from his
     cage, bored as hell.  HEAR the surrounding noise, chatter, LOUD
     Sinatra music, of a very large party.  PULL BACK to see...

     ... and overdecorated BALLROOM, in dim and dramatic lighting,
     dripping with the trappings of ANCIENT ROME.  The mingling guests
     are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party, most of
     them older women.  They are served by wandering well-built ATHLETES
     in Roman togas or gladiator costumes.  PAN TO...

     ...  Julianne, still in her suit, hiding by a table piled with a
     carload of grapes.  Her left hand still buried in her pocket.  The
     eyes of a hunted animal.  From nowhere...

                    MANDY/SAMMY (O.S.)
              Boo!!!

     She JUMPS a foot, both hands FLYING UP, left one awkwardly slamming
     back into its pocket.  The girls have snuck up behind her.  They
     have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons
     wrapped around their bodies.

                    MANDY
              I know why you're scared of our
              party.  It's too hip.

     Sinatra singing "Stranger In The Night." Hugely-muscled, half-naked
     black and white studs, serving enchanted blue-haired ladies.

                    SAMMY
              Kimberly wanted to tickle the
              grandmas, so we figured, give
              'em a cheap thrill.  Walter
              supplied the decorative
              touches...

                    SAMMY
                   (points out the jokes)
              Nose tackle from the Bears...
              power forward from the Bulls...
              defenseman from the Black
              Hawks... my personal favorite,
              the designated hitter...

                    MANDY
              ... I'm partial to the tight end.

                    SAMMY
              This is USDA Prime, largely
              available, beef.  With no notice-
              able competition, present company
              excepted...

     Now they stare at her.  With identical, really odd, smiles.

                    SAMMY
              And yet here you are.  All
              celibate and reclusive.

                    MANDY
              With those big, dark, haunted eyes.
              As if you were harborin' some...
              unspeakably... guilty... secret.

     Oh.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, I'm worried about something.

     Something.  Their expressions are deliciously, identically
     expectant.

                    JULIANNE
              Oh.  I left this really important
              file in Walter's office.  I have
              to send my editor some...

     Some...

                    JULIANNE
              ... figures.  On territorial sales.
              To close my book deal.

     Uh-huh...

                    JULIANNE
              So Kim gave me the key.  And
              Michael's on his way, to drive
              me down to Wal...

                    SAMMY
              Oh.  We thought it was the ring.

     Julianne blinks.  Ring...?

                    MANDY
              The one you better get the fuck
              off your third finger left hand.

     Ah.  That ring.

                    JULIANNE
              Well.  See.  That was a...
              reflex to see if it would...

                    MANDY
                   (helpful)
              ... look good on Kimberly.

                    JULIANNE
              Right.  And then it didn't want
              to come off.  Exactly.

                    SAMMY
              Maybe it's happy there.

                    MANDY
              Oh the way out of the crab house?
              We asked Michael if we could see
              the ring?

                    SAMMY
              He said you told him.  It'd be
              safer with you.

                    MANDY
              An so it is.

     Julianne for once is speechless.  To our amazement, the girls wear
     identical smiles of kindness and support.

                    MANDY
              Shut up, sugar, he's on his way.
              Let's get to work.

     INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Huge gleaming chaotic kitchen.  Cooks, waiters, working at top
     speed.  The three women RACE in, look around frantically, half the
     guys stop to ogle the twins.  CUT TO...

     ANGLES... and industrial-sized jar of peanut butter.  Julianne's hand
     PLUNGES in, halfway to the rolled-up sleeve at her elbow.  SMOOCHES
     it around, real good.  PULL BACK to reveal...

     ... she is surrounded by the twins and six guys, all SHOUTING
     conflicting instructions.  Julianne FLINGS off the excess SLOP.
     Tugs for all she's worth...

                    EIGHT PEOPLE
              TWIST IT!  TWIST IT!

     Nada.  It won't budge.  A sous chef WIPES her hand with a towel, a
     janitor CRASHES a tool kit onto the counter.  THROWS it open, pulls
     out...

     ... a spray can of WD-40.  Instantly, her hand is BLACK.  The guy TUGS.
     No movement.  He can't believe it.

                    JANITOR
              It's mental, lady, you ain't
              trying!

     Sammy is rummaging through her handbag, pulling out...

                    SAMMY
              There is nothing so tight, this
              can't help it...

     ... a tube of jelly.  The letter K-Y.  Julianne just gives her a look.
     Mandy pushes through with a butcher's CLEAVER...

                    MANDY
              I saw this on Hard Copy.  People
              cut off body parts and the
              hospital sew 'em back o...

     The look has turned toward her.

                    JULIANNE
                   (cold)
              I saw the show.

                    MANDY
              ... well, maybe it works on
              fingers, too.

                    FLOWER GIRL (O.S.)
              Aunt Mandy...?

     Everybody turns.  The little girl in the doorway.  Southern accent...

                    FLOWER GIRL
              Mr.  Michael's here.

     Everything gets real quiet.  Mandy takes charge.  She rolls down
     Julianne's left sleeve, RIPS the hem out of the cuff, so that it
     flaps down over her hand, covering the ring.  Sammy wipes the black
     stuff from Julianne's fingers.

                    MANDY
              Don't worry, baby.  You could
              pick your nose with that finger
              and Michael would never notice.
              He's a man.

     The twins lead her off.  We're on their backs for...

                    MANDY (O.S.)
              Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's
              marrying the wrong girl.

                    SAMMY (O.S.)
              You're much more his type.

     EXT.  DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

     VIEW through a heavy glass door of the empty, dimly-lit lobby.
     PULL BACK to see Julianne, just as she...

     ... KICKS the shit out of the glass! Almost breaks her foot.

                    JULIANNE
              I can't believe this!

     PULL BACK farther to see Michael still trying keys from a large key
     ring in the heavy lock.  Sign over the door says WALLACE ENTERPRISES.
     Traffic hustles by, oblivious to her suffering.

                    MICHAEL
              It's no big deal, she just gave
              you the wrong keys that's s...

                    JULIANNE
              ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR?
              A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL
              TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S
              GOTTA BE IN TH...

     And she SLAMS her whole BODY against the glass, making it rattle ominously.

                    JULIANNE
              WHERE'S A BRICK?  FIND ME A
              GODDAMN BRICK!!

     She looks around wildly, hysterical.

                    MICHAEL
              What is the big deal about
              getting this file tonight?

     A good question.  She needs a good answer.

                    JULIANNE
              I promised Digger I'd E-mail him
              those figures.

     From his face, that wasn't it.

                    JULIANNE
              They are very important figures.

     Apparently.  He's just staring at her.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm up against a deadline.

                    MICHAEL
              Me, too.  I'm getting married
              tomorrow.

                    JULIANNE
              That's my point!!

     Now.  He really doesn't get it.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean, tomorrow... we'll all be
              busy with more important things.
              So...

     So?

                    JULIANNE
              ... tonight's my last chance.

     He sighs.

                    MICHAEL
              I forgot how cute you look.  When
              you get impossible.

                    JULIANNE
              It's just... up there... right in
              front of Walter's... y'know, computer.
              If memory serves.

     Helpless.

                    JULIANNE
              We could use... his computer, to...
              just E-mail those suckers right ou...

                    MICHAEL
              Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing
              business.  Crack of dawn, Monday,
              Walter'll take you up there...

     Her eyes fill with tears.  He is mystified.  Smiles tenderly.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Give it up, kid.

     Touches her hair.

                    MICHAEL
              You can't win 'em all.

     And slowly, he takes her hand.  Leads her way.  She takes one
     backward glance at the locked door.  Her last dream dies.

     INT.  LOBBY, RITZ CARLTON - NIGHT

     Michael and a disconsolate Julianne board the elevator.  He presses
     15, she pushes 11.  Michael carries a handful of messages slips and
     an envelope.  As the car starts up, she folds her arms across her
     chest, at the edge of tears.  He doesn't know what to do.

                    MICHAEL
                   (gently)
              Listen up, huh? Even if you blow
              this deal, how big could it be?

                    JULIANNE
                   (voice nearly cracking)
              You're right.  Easy come, easy go.

     He's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Jules?

     She won't look at him.  She wants to die.  The bell RINGS, the doors
     open to her floor.  She just walks out.

     And he follows.  They stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip
     trembling.  She can't believe how close she is to losing it.

                    MICHAEL
              This thing means that much to
              y...

                    JULIANNE
              It means a lot.

     He nods.  Okay.

                    MICHAEL
              I'll call the house, Walter's
              probably not even asleep...

     Her mouth drops.  She can't believe this.

                    MICHAEL
              I'll drive you out there, we'll
              get the key, we'll go back to
              the office...

     She THROWS her arms around his, HUGGING him so hard, so close.  He
     laughs, she is so weird.  She pulls back, beaming, glowing.

                    MICHAEL
              Come on, we'll call from your
              room.

     She claps his hand.  As they head down the hall...

                    MICHAEL
              If I fall asleep on the altar
              tomorrow...

     He's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...

                    MICHAEL
              ... you better be there to...
              funny, these are all from Ben.

     She's at her door, turning the key.  He looks at the envelope.

                    MICHAEL
              The fax is from Ben, too.  Man,
              it's my wedding, and my boss can't
              leave me alone...

                    JULIANNE
                   (entering her room)
              ... maybe it's congratulations.

     He follows her in, opening the envelope.  Stops.  Reads.  And his face
     suddenly... freezes.  To stone.

                    JULIANNE
                   (turning to him)
              Michael? What ha...

                    MICHAEL
                   (reading)
              Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing
              this to you on the night before
              your wedding.  But I think you
              need and deserve to know...

     And he looks up to her.

                    MICHAEL
              ... what you're marrying into.

     He hands it toward her.  She takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past.
     Toward the phone.

                    JULIANNE
                   (reading)
              I received the following E-mail
              this afternoon... "Ben, I need a
              favor.  My daughter's every
              happiness...  "

     Her eyes BUG OUT of her head.  Holy shit! We can hear him DIALING the
     phone.  She keeps reading, it's all there.  How did this happen?

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Isabelle?  I need to talk to
              Kim...

                    JULIANNE
                   (reading)
              "Mike, the funny thing is, he's
              offering you a gig you'd be
              stupid to turn down..."

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              I'm just tired.  Please put her
              on?  Thanks.

                    JULIANNE
                   (reading)
              "Maybe you should take the job.
              And dump the girl."

     And when she turns...

                    MICHAEL
              Jules.  Could you give me a
              minute?

     He looks more sick than angry.  As if the heart has just been cut
     out of him.  She doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands,
     staring dumbly.

                    MICHAEL
              Please?

     She nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her.
     Now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag,
     sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door.

     She doesn't look elated.  She seems frightened, distraught, and
     most of all, confused.  Because she can't understand why.  She digs
     absently through her bag.  Cigarettes.  Box of matches.

     She lights up.  Draws deeply.  Somehow, she seems near tears, and
     laughs bitterly at that.  Shakes her head at how fucked-up she finds
     herself.  Squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.

                    BELLMAN
              Miss, are you locked out,
              or something?

     She looks up.  A small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded
     but neatly-kept uniform.  On his cart, a ton of bags.

                    JULIANNE
              No, I just stepped out, because...
              it's a non-smoking room.

     And inhales deeply.  Leans back against the door, to look up at him
     more comfortably.

                    BELLMAN
                   (politely)
              Well, it's non-smoking floor,
              too.  Maybe you could go to the...

                    JULIANNE
                   (seriously)
              Why don't you have me arrested?

     That wasn't sarcastic.  He doesn't know what to say.

                    JULIANNE
              I mean that.  Arrested, convicted,
              put in solitary.

     Another puff.

                    JULIANNE
              See, I'm a dangerous, criminal
              person.  I do bad things to
              honest people.  This, see, this
              smoking?  Tip of the iceberg.

     Waves her hand.

                    JULIANNE
              Make a citizen's arrest, I won't
              struggle.  It'll be like getting
              Al Capone on tax evasion.

     Now she seems angry.  But not at him.  Her eyes fill with tears.

                    BELLMAN
              Can I... Can I help you, miss?

     She squints at his nameplate.

                    JULIANNE
              Do you smoke, Richard?

                    BELLMAN
              Yes, ma'am, I do, but it's...

                    JULIANNE
              ... a non-smoking floor, yeah.
              Well, you know what?

     And she takes the cigarette from her lips.  Turns it around, holds
     it out to him.  Go ahead.  He doesn't move.  Please! And so...

     ... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand.  Staring in
     her eyes, he takes a deep drag.  Savors an expert nostril-inhale of
     his exhaled smoke.  Hands the cigarette back to her...

                    BELLMAN
              My grandmother always said,
              "This, too, shall pass."

     She swallows.  Wipes at her eyes.  Finds a smile.

                    JULIANNE
              Thanks, Richard.  If you weren't
              on duty, I'd buy you a drink.

     He just nods.  She waves.  He waves back, pushes his cart down the
     hall.  As she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly OPENS,
     and she...

     ... FALLS through it, flat on her back at Michael's feet.  Staring up
     at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep
     drag.

                    JULIANNE
              What happened?

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              It's over.

     And crouches down.  Close beside her.  The cigarette drops from her
     hand, unnoticed on the carpet.  So he lifts it, crushes it on the
     heel of his shoe.

                    MICHAEL
              I want you to quit this shit,
              it'll kill you.

     She just nods, obediently.  Okay, I will.

                    MICHAEL
              She denied it.  Said I was crazy
              and paranoid.

                    JULIANNE
              A bad combination.

     He tries to smile.  It's really hard.

                    MICHAEL
              There's this big brunch tomorrow
              morning?  At her place.

     He lets the air out.  Slow.  So he won't cry.

                    MICHAEL
              She said "How can I call everything
              off, what do I tell everybody?"

     Shakes his head.  Can you imagine that?

                    JULIANNE
              Michael...

                    MICHAEL
              No, it's for the best, it really
              is.  We were so wrong for each
              other.

                    JULIANNE
              Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...

                    MICHAEL
              The job thing would have broken
              us up, eventually, anyway.  She
              couldn't have lived with it.  I
              know that now.

     Julianne nods.  Maybe that part is right.  Maybe it would have
     ended anyway.  Maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.

                    MICHAEL
               And she's right, I'm crazy to
               fall for someone.  I hardly
               knew.

     Looks deep in her eyes.  He's so glad she's there.

                    MICHAEL
              Hey.  You still got that ring?

     She holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away.  The
     ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.

                    JULIANNE
              I tried it on.  But it won't
              come off.

     He smiles at that.  A sad smile of friendship.  Then takes her
     finger gently...

     ... into his mouth.  It is something like a kiss.  And when he
     removes her moistened finger...

     ... he pulls the ring OFF.  Nothing to it.  She blinks.

                    JULIANNE
              It's mental, you know.

     He doesn't understand that.

                    JULIANNE
              Should we take a walk?  Or
              maybe some food sent up, or
              something...

                    MICHAEL
              I just want to be alone.  Is
              that okay?

     She nods, sure.  He kisses her cheek.  Stands up.

                    MICHAEL
              Maybe I'll go back to New York.
              Hang with you for awhile, huh?
              Ben'll understand.

     She nods again.  Whatever you say.  He steps into the open doorway...

                    MICHAEL
              Or we'll go somewhere.  If you
              have the time.

                    JULIANNE
              If San Antonio sweeps
              Sacramento...

     They smiles at each other.  For real.

                    JULIANNE
              I've never been to Texas.

     Imagine that.  The look holds.  Just above a whisper...

                    MICHAEL
              Thanks for coming to my wedding.

     And then he's gone.

     IN.JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her
     image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver
     RINGING.

                    DIGGER (V.O.  MACHINE)
              Digger and George are with
              family in the Hamptons until
              Monday morning.  Brevity is even
              more in order than usual.

     BEEP.

                    JULIANNE
              Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...

     Her eyes find the pack of cigarettes.  Next to her toiletries kit.

                    JULIANNE
                   (softly)
              I won.

     Her fingers touch the pack.  As if an object of significance.  Takes
     it up.

                    JULIANNE
              Amazing, huh?  I didn't do things
              quite your way.  But... I got it
              down.

     Cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top
     of the pack completely open.

                    JULIANNE
              And forty years and nine grand-
              children later, when I sit with
              Michael on some rustic porch,
              slogging through our sweet swamp
              of nostalgic memories...

     Reaches the pack toward the toilet.

                    JULIANNE
              No one is going to sweet the
              details...

     Turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.

                    JULIANNE
              Of one weekend in Chicago.

     Drops the lid with a CLATTER.  Hits the FLUSH.

                    JULIANNE
              Talk about celebration...

     She lifts a tube from her toiletries kit.  Stares at it, real
     close.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm gonna brush my teeth with
              actual toothpaste.

     Turns it over, reads all the writing.  Yep.

                    JULIANNE
              I guess I'm too exhausted to
              feel the elation I so richly
              undeserve...

     Squeezes some paste onto her brush.  Carefully.

                    JULIANNE
              So I'm gonna hold calls at the
              desk... while I get my...

     Start brushing.

                    JULIANNE
                   (around, her mouthful)
              God, it is toothpaste, they
              should sell this stuff
              commercially! Anyway, a girl
              does need her...

     Squints at her image.  Laughs, spewing a little foam.

                    JULIANNE
              ... well, we're a bit past
              worrying about beauty sleep.
              Let's just settle for not
              frightening small animals.

     She SPITS.  Tells Digger's machine...

                     JULIANNE
              Anyway, I couldn't have done
              it without you.  Even though I
              did, if you follow that.

     Wipes her mouth.  Stares off.  The eyes a little dreamy.

                    JULIANNE
              Three words:  Happily.  Ever.
              Well, you know.

                                   SMASH CUT TO:

     INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

     Julianne sprawled all over the bed, mouth open like a carp,
     sleeping mask against the daylight.  A sudden RAPPING at the
     door, and she...

     ... sits BOLT UPRIGHT.  Utterly disoriented, until she pulls off
     the mask.  Stumbles out of bed, walking toward the firm KNOCKING,
     when...

     ... it stops.  A message slip SLIDES beneath her door.  She lifts
     it, barely conscious.  This wakes her up.  In one.

                    JULIANNE
                   (to the slip)
              You're going where?

     EXT.  WALLACE ESTATE - DAY

     Julianne climbs from her taxi.  Only slightly in awe, she sets off
     past the reflecting pool, which fronts a mansion of graceful stone
     and timber.  It's a hike today, because the circular drives is
     clogged deep with Bentleys, Mercedes, and waiting limos, vying for
     space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds, maintenance
     trucks, catering and florist and food vans.

     INT.  GREAT ROOM - DAY

     Julianne escorted into an enormous room, where brunch is in
     progress for more than a hundred.  She looks from the vaulted
     ceilings, to the frescoed walls, the inlaid floors, the massive
     pipe organ above the stone staircase, the oil portraits of Scottish
     ancestors and their favorite dogs.

     Isabelle has risen from the main table, and comes to her.  All
     smiles.  Julianne is in the Twilight Zone.  What are these people
     laughing about?  Do they still think there's a wedding?

                    ISABELLE
              Jules.  We're so glad you
              slept in.

     Takes her arm graciously.  This woman would make Anne Bancroft look
     coarse.  As they walk...

                    ISABELLE
              Now, you have a choice.  The idea
              is bride and groom shouldn't see
              each other on the magic day...

     Julianne looking all around.  Magic day it seems to be.  Where the
     bell is a bride or a groom?

                    ISABELLE
              So Michael stays put in the garden.
              Kimmy stays in here...

     Pointing.  THERE she is, obscured by a cluster of the appropriately
     fawning.  She has the same hunted eyes and false, slightly manic
     smile Julianne wore yesterday.  This, at least, makes sense.

                    ISABELLE (O.S.)
              ... and the guests go back and
              forth.  Where will you start?

     CLOSE on Julianne.  Watching the brave, frightened bride.

                    JULIANNE
              She looks tense.

                    ISABELLE
                   (O.S., calmly)
              Nerves.  I would never have
              guessed.

     EXT.  ROSE GARDEN - DAAY

     A steward leads Julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden,
     altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic
     tables, where nearly a hundred guests casually dine, served by
     rolling carts.

     There, at the head table, Michael staring at us.  He looks like a
     poor attempt to cover a hard night.  She locks onto his eyes.  What
     the hell is going on? He looks helpless, miserable.  She gestures
     with her head, follow me.  Stalks off.

     EXT.  SCULPTURE GARDEN - DAY

     Bronze abstract pieces, some quite large, face a huge set of
     children's swings, regulation playground size.  Julianne sits in
     one, moving slightly back and forth.  Trying to hold on to her
     temper and her sanity.

     In the distance, trucks are winding their way to and from the pond,
     where crews are setting up tents, lights, heaters for tonight.  The
     circus has come to town.  When she looks back...

     Michael approaches.  Before he can draw a breath...

                    JULIANNE
              I had the craziest dream last
              night?  Walter and Kimmy had
              asked your boss to...

                    MICHAEL
              Look, I came down here to face
              everybody.  I didn't want to
              slink away like some coward...

                    JULIANNE
              But the Scotch salmon was so
              fucking good, you decided to
              stay for brunch!

                    MICHAEL
              She hasn't told anybody, what
              am I supposed to do?

                    JULIANNE
              Get married, apparently.

     She comes OFF the swing, PUSHES him back two feet.

                    JULIANNE
              What the hell are you thinking
              of, the goddamn wedding is SIX
              O'CLOCK!!

     He swallows hard.  Trapped.

                    MICHAEL
              This is her family and her
              fault.

                    JULIANNE
              And your point?

                    MICHAEL
                   (ten years old)
              Well.  How come she didn't...

                    JULIANNE
              BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS
              YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR
              EACH OTHER.

     He just blinks.

                    MICHAEL
              Hey.  This is a serious matter.

     Thank you.  She POKES his chest, punctuating...

                    JULIANNE
              I'll be right back.

     INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

     A modern take on the Medieval castle kitchen, towering ceilings,
     dark wood, copper pots hanging, a series of walk-in coolers and
     freezers.  The place is a madhouse of activity, as prep cooks
     slice, chop, sort, every kind of food imaginable, and delivery
     teams bring more.

     The girls walk through.  Alone together in the eye of the
     hurricane.  Kim choked with excess sentiment...

                    KIMMY
              Look at all this beautiful food,
              so lovingly prepared...

                    JULIANNE
              They'll eat it anyway, you ever
              been to a walk?

     Kimmy's lip trembles.  This is not how she thought of her wedding.
     The din is so horrific, Kimmy leads them into a walk-in meat
     locker.  Even here, two BUTCHERS are dressing Eastern-fresh corn-
     fed carcasses.

                    JULIANNE
              You guys want to give us a
              minute?

     The men blink at each other.

                    JULIANNE
              We'd like to be alone with
              our pork.

     On that basis.  They leave.  Kimmy sits on a stack of packaged
     frozen fowl parts.  Stares up with big, sweet, wet eyes.

                    KIMMY
              How's he doing?

     Julianne cannot believe this.

                    JULIANNE
              Who?  The jerk who's running
              your life?

                    KIMMY
              This must be... very, very,
              hard on him.

                    JULIANNE
              What with the psychosis and
              all, yeah.

     Leans in.  Listen...

                    JULIANNE
              When are you gonna come clean
              with your folks?

                    KIMMY
              Don't you see...

                    JULIANNE
              If you're waiting for "Do you
              take this man?", that's
              considered poor form.

                    KIMMY
              ... that this is all my fault?

     Stops Julianne cold.  Your fault.

                    KIMMY
              Whatever delusions I drove him to,
              there is truth at the heart of it.
              I want him to work for my father.
              I want to stay in school.  I want
              a life of my own!

     Harder and harder for Julianne to push.  Her mouth is dry.

                    JULIANNE
              Yeah, well, lots of couples are
              imcompat...

                    KIMMY
              I love him.

     Fragile and strong at once.  A plea.

                    KIMMY
              Tell him it's my fault and
              that I love him.

     A long beat.

                    JULIANNE
              I'll be right back.

     EXT.  TENNIS COURT - DAY

     The court has become a giant holding pen for tonight's BALLOONS.
     There are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all
     directions, under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread
     across the top of the court's chain-link fence.

     Michael stands outside the court, clutching the chain link like a
     prisoner, as Julianne comes through the gate.  From somewhere, we
     hear high, squeaky, alien voice-like SOUNDS.  Incongruous
     against...

                    MICHAEL
              How is she?

     Julianne absorbs this.  As the bizarre SOUNDS continue, she WHIRLS
     around...

                    JULIANNE
              KNOCK IT OFF!!!

     We now see three STONER COLLEGE GUYS, who have been filling the
     endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court.
     Clearly, they've been inhaling their working materials.

                      STONER KID
                   (Minnie Mouse)
              YES, SIR!

     A Nazi salute.  When she turns back...

                    MICHAEL
              I asked you...

                    JULIANNE
              She admits it's her fault.

     He absorbs that.  And then...

                    MICHAEL
              Do you think she still loves
              me?

     We watch the struggle inside her.  Her voice drops...

                    JULIANNE
              Sure, she does.  She's crazy
              about you.

     Now tears stand in both their eyes.  The stoners are doing their
     Alvin and the Chipmuks impersonation festival in the B.G., singing
     in castrato harmony.  But our two don't notice.

                    MICHAEL
              I keep asking, how can I explain
              what happened? And I keep
              getting that same answer all
              night long.

     Which is...

                    MICHAEL
              I can't.  And it doesn't matter.
              I drove her to it, because I
              want things my way.  And even
              if she did something tricky and
              unfair... she was blinded by
              love, okay?

     Julianne swallows.  For obvious reasons.

                    JULIANNE
              Does that make it right...

                    MICHAEL
              Love doesn't have to be right.
              It just has to be love.

     The stoner are now helium-crooning "Bridge Over Troubled Waters."
     Actually, they're getting better.

                    MICHAEL
              She's giving up half her life
              for me, and I'm bitching because
              it hurts her.

                    STONERS
                   (singing)
              Sail on silver girl
                 Sail on by...

                    MICHAEL
              She's a saint!  And I'm a
              worthless ingrate!

                    STONERS
                   (singing)
              Your time has come to shine,
                 All your dreams are on their way...

                    MICHAEL
              Tell her.  I'll marry her at six
              o'clock, if she'll still have me.

     The stoners blend on the high note.  It's pretty moving.

                    JULIANNE
              I'll be right back.

     INT.  ORGAN LOFT - DAY

     PAN along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents.  Nearly
     twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the
     diners in the Great Room, extending al the way to...

     ... an organ loft.  Alone, above the noise of the party, Julianne
     and Kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase.  Trapped
     between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth
     organ.  Dwarfed by their surroundings, Kimmy draws the hardest
     breath of her life...

                    KIMMY
                   (whispers)
              So.  What did he say?

     Julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.

                    JULIANNE
              He said.  Marry me.

     Kimmy YELPS in her ecstasy, FLINGING herself against Julianne, and
     they go DOWN full length across the organ's pedals, BLASTING the
     room with a MONSTER CHORD of china-rattling volume and horrifying
     disharmony.

     As grown men and women SCREAM in spontaneous terror below, Kimmy
     begins to...

     ... LAUGH.  And KISS and hug her new sister.  And holds her tight.

     EXT.  WILLOW POND - DAY

     Julianne and Michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking
     POND, ringed with WILLOWS that dig heavy branches to the water's
     surface.  He is relieved, reflective.  Head down, he never notices
     that she is...

     ... dangerously freaked.  Too petrified even to hyperventilate,
     we're lucky she's breathing at all.  We watch her life unraveling
     before her glassy eyes.

                    MICHAEL
                   (never looks up)
              Thank God you were here.

                    JULIANNE
                   (mumbles to herself)
              Oh, yeah.

                    MICHAEL
              I was so confused, so conflicted,
              so... unstable.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, it happens.

     They pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking
     area.  Family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans.  Everything
     that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.

                    MICHAEL
              I might have thrown away...

     Searching for the right words.

                    JULIANNE
              ... your one chance for true
              happiness?

                    MICHAEL
              ... yeah, that.

                    JULIANNE
              You never want to do that, see,
              that's always a... costly
              turnover.  As they say in the
              sport biz.

     There's a vague Stepford Wife quality to her voice.  He hears that
     now, and looks at her.  Maybe he can't tell she's frightened.  But
     he can tell she's something.

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              Are you okay?

     She stops walking.  She can't look at him, so she looks around.
     Across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly-
     colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and
     chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be
     strung.  At the center of it all...

     .... a huge topiary White Sox batter, just completing a murderous
     swing.  He's maybe fifteen feet tall.  She points to it...

                    JULIANNE
              The Big Hurt, huh?

                    MICHAEL
              Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the
              past.  And he likes the little
              guys.

     So Julianne nods.  Because she does too.  Squints up at Michael.

                    JULIANNE
              Got a minute?

     He nods, you bet.  Worried for her.  What is this? She looks in
     another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached...

     ... a stage that's been set up for the band.  Chairs, music stands,
     sound equipment.  A gleaming dance floor, already in place over the
     lawn.  Next to it, a shimmering white GAZEBO.  Like the centerpiece
     of a wedding cake.

                    JULIANNE
              Why is the dance floor by the
              gazebo?

     She takes his hand.  They walk toward it.

                    MICHAEL
              Kimmy's idea.  She thought it
              would be such a romantic place.
              For our wedding dance.

     Looking down at her.

                    MICHAEL
              What's up?

                    JULIANNE
              Shhh.

     Up the white steps now.  Together.  The gazebo floor has been
     covered with hardwood.  The perfect place.  For a wedding dance.
     And Julianne...

     ... turns, suddenly.  He almost runs into her.  She is staring up
     at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart.  He is caught,
     transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              I have to say this quick, okay,
              or I'll have this massive
              coronary and you'll never have
              to hear it.  Which you need to.
              Does that make any sense at all?

     The coronary part does.  We can feel her heart beating from here.

                    MICHAEL
              Jules, what's wrong...

                    JULIANNE
              This is the dumbest thing I will
              ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that
              I can't.  I don't think.

     And then, she does.  She puts her hands flat on his chest.  Looks
     in his eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              Michael, I love you.

     A heartbeat passes.

                    JULIANNE
              I've loved you for nine years,
              but I was too arrogant and
              scared to realize it.  Now I'm
              just scared.

     He stares at her, dumbstruck.  She moves even closer.

                    JULIANNE
              I know this comes at an
              inopportune time, but I have to
              ask this one really gigantic
              favor, okay?

     Holds her breath.  And...

                    JULIANNE
              Choose me.  Marry me.  Let me
              make you happy.

     And in a half beat of excruciating silence...

                    JULIANNE
              I know.  It sounds like three
              favors.

     His eyes are loving.  They care for her.  She swallows, lost in
     them.

                    JULIANNE
              But when you think about it...

     Slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth...

     ... to his.  The most beautiful kiss she will ever offer.  All of
     her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body...

     ... a SCREAM rips the world to pieces.  They whirl to see...

     ... KIMMY, halfway up the path.  Her hands across her mouth, as if
     to stem the horror that pours forth as she SHRIEKS from her soul,
     and...

     ... runs.  Back Down the path.  Michael BOLTING after her, SHOUTING
     her name.  A frozen moment, and...

     ... Julianne TAKES OFF after him.  All three running, SCREAMING
     their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop
     to watch from neighboring countries.

     Kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead.
     LEAPS into her convertible and PEELS OUT, just TEARING up the
     gravel as she ROCKETS out of sight.  No way to catch her.  Still...

     ... Michael is racing for the cars.  Julianne, sprinting her guts
     out, losing ground with every stride.  Michael JUMPS into a
     Cherokee...

                    JULIANNE
              MICHAEL, DON'T, YOU'LL NEVER
              CATCH HER!!

     He GRINDS the gears.  She keeps RUNNING.  His engine FIRES.

                    JULIANNE
              SHE HAS TOO BIG A LEAD AND SHE
              DRIVES LIKE A RABID ANIMAL!!!

     He BLASTS OFF.  She keeps going.  Gasping for air, clutching her side,
     she's dying here.  Slams into a florist's truck, looks inside, shit!
     Next, a butcher's van, looks inside, Jesus!

                    JULIANNE
                   (to the world at large)
              DOESN'T ANYBODY LEAVE KEYS
              ANYMORE?  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO
              TRUST??

     Up ahead, Michael has STALLED the Cherokee.  She still has a chance,
     DASHES to the next van.  BORNSTEIN EXTERMINATION, a handsome
     rendering of a rat above the TOXIC MATERIALS warning FLINGS the
     door open.  Stumbles in.  Keys!

                    JULIANNE (O.S.)
              THANK GOD, A SAMARITAN!!

     Michael SPEEDS away.  She KICKS the ratmobile in gear.

     LURCHES off.

     INT.  RATMOBILE, DOWNTOWN CHICAGO - DAY

     Julianne tearing through traffic, desperately struggling to keep
     Michael's Cherokee in view, while she shrieks into her cellular...

                    JULIANNE
              IT IS NOT GOING WELL!

     Down the block, Michael WHIPS around a corner.  We follow suit to see
     his destination dead ahead.  Union Station.  The DISPATCHER RADIO
     intrudes...

                    DISPATCHER (O.S.)
              Uh, Unit Four Baker Charlie,
              how we cookin' on that Skokiie
              infestation?

     Now she's steering the car, tearing at the radio controls, and
     screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder...

                    JULIANNE
              THIS IS WHAT COMES OF TELLING
              THE TRUTH!

                    FIELD MAN (O.S.)
              Copy, dispatcher...

                    JULIANNE
              OR EVEN PART OF IT!

                    FIELD MAN (O.S.)
              Uh, what happens if you got
              that methyl-ethyl shit on
              your hands?

     Michael RIPS into the train station's parking lot.  We SWERVE
     around a taxi, CUT OFF Harley, CAREEN into the lot...

                    JULIANNE
              GETTING WHAT YOU DESERVE IS
              NOT FAIR!

                    DISPATCHER (O.S.)
              Uh, you got maybe thirty seconds
              before you're sterile.  For God's
              sake don't touch yourself, or
              anything.

     Up ahead, Michael is OUT of his jeep and running.

                    JULIANNE
              AND I HATE TALKING TO YOUR
              MACHINE!

     She SLAMS on the brakes, THROWING herself against the wheel.

                    YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
              Uh, this is One Monkey Zebra.
              It wasn't bees in the gal's
              wall, it was cats!

     She TEARS the door open.  SCRAMBLE OUT...

                    YOUNGER FIELD MAN (O.S.)
              She says gas 'em, anyway,
              she'll pay cash.  Uh... how
              do I pay this?

     WITH Julianne now, RACING through the lot, Michael vanishes INTO
     the Station, she PLUNGES in after him, BOUNCING off bystanders,
     apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion,
     threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk,
     catching a lucky glimpse as he heads...

     ... DOWN a staircase to the TRACKS.  My God, what's he doing?  A
     second wind, fueled by panic, and she BOLTS after him, DANCING down
     the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the
     concourse to see him, running for...

     ... Track 29, a train already RUMBLING, ready to pull out, she
     SPRINTS after him.

                    JULIANNE
              MICHAEL!!

     He DISAPPEARS behind the train, she FALLS, skids, springs up,
     pushes through gaping onlookers, almost there, the train PULLS
     AWAY...

                    JULIANNE
              NNNOOOO!!!

     But he's just standing there.  His back to us.  Watching it go.

     Her body nearly collapses with relief.  She pushes herself on, but
     her legs aren't working right in their maxed-out fatigue, and she
     lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him.  He's still lost
     in thought, staring after the train.

     She tries to speak, but there's no breath.  So she puts her hands
     on her knees and just GASPS for air like a dog.  Wheezing, panting,
     trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually
     turns and...

     ... JUMPS out of his skin!  A heart attack seeing her.

                    JULIANNE
                   (croaks)
              Don't speak!

     He just blinks at this sweaty, ripped-up, maniacal figure.

                    MICHAEL
              Uh.  I saw that moving...

                    JULIANNE
              DON'T SPEAK!

     FLINGING both her hands across his mouth.  A frozen beat.  He nods,
     okay.  Cautiously, she takes her hands away.  At least she has made
     him smile, in spite of everything.  At least she's done that.

                    JULIANNE
              I have to make a confession.
              Another confession.  Besides
              that I love you.  This is even
              worse.

     This.  He's waiting to hear.

                    JULIANNE
              The E-mail?  You thought Walter
              sent your boss?  I wrote that.

     You.  WHAT?!  Synapse overload.

                    MICHAEL
              You're not saying you actually...
              you're saying that y...

                    JULIANNE
                   (stricken with remorse)
              ... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the
              bad guy.

                    MICHAEL
              ARE YOU CRAZY?

     She nods her head wildly, hair flopping.

                    MICHAEL
              ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY INSANE??

     Bigger nodding.

                    MICHAEL
              ARE YOU ON DRUGS???

     Shakes her head, like a two-year-old.

                    MICHAEL
                   (pacing in circles)
              I mean, do you realize what
              you've... well, of course you
              realize, that's why you're
              confessing, I mean... I mean...
              how could you do that?

                    JULIANNE
              I didn't know it would get
              sent.  I just wanted you to...
              get mad at Kimmy... and...

     And watching.  As this begins to sink in.

                    JULIANNE
              I've done nothing but slimy,
              underhanded, despicable, not
              even terribly imaginative,
              things.  Ever since I got
              here.  Trying to...

     Staring in his eyes.  Eyes she can't read at this point.

                    JULIANNE
              ... to win you.  To win you
              back.

     Tears in her own eyes now.  Big ones.

                    JULIANNE
              And I was blinded by love.
              Like you said.

     Shaking her head...

                    JULIANNE
              But that doesn't excuse any
              part of it.  I am pond scum.

     No...

                    JULIANNE
              Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus
              that feeds on pond scum.  Lower.
              The layer of mucous that cruds up
              the fung...

                    MICHAEL
              Lower.

                    JULIANNE
                   (agreeing)
              Lower.

                    MICHAEL
              The pus that infects the mucous
              that cruds up the fungus.

     And to her amazement.  The trace of a smile...

                    MICHAEL
                   (softly)
              On the other hand, thank you.

     She blinks at that.  Which squeezes out a tear.

                    MICHAEL
              For loving me that much, that
              way.

     He shrugs.  Just above a whisper...

                    MICHEL
              It's pretty flattering.

                    JULIANNE
              Except it makes me fungus.

                    MICHAEL
              Well, that part I knew.

     She's never loved him more.

                    JULIANNE
              So you have to marry Kim.
              Because she will actually make
              you happy.  I, in contrast, am
              a shallow, neurotic psychopath,
              with relatively little to offer.

     Okay?

                    JULIANNE
              Kim.  Nod your head.  Do as
              you're told.

     He nods his head, still smiling.  Her tears are running now.  Maybe
     she doesn't notice.

                    JULIANNE
              Just promise you'll never tell
              me who you would have chosen.
              If I hadn't confessed.

     She chokes back a sob.

                    JULIANNE
              Cos if you would have chosen me.
              Then I threw away a perfectly
              good life.  Just to be a decent
              person.  Which is a questionable
              trade-off.  Right?

     He nods, slowly.  Because he's supposed to.

                    JULIANNE
              And if you would have chosen
              some 20-year-old punk over me.
              I'd have to kill myself.

     Ah.  His smile keeps getting smaller.  More loving.  More wonderful.

                    MICHAEL
                   (whispers)
              I'll take it to my grave.

     Good.  She looks around.

                    JULIANNE
              I'm so glad you didn't jump on
              that train, before...

                    MICHAEL
              I came here, looking for her.

     For her.  The words leave a silence.

                    JULIANNE
              Why would she come here...

                    MICHAEL
              This is where I proposed.

     Stares deep in her eyes.  She needs to hear this.

                    MICHAEL
              I had to cover a game in
              Milwaukee.  She saw me off.
              And when the train started to
              leave... I jumped up on the
              step, I help the handle, and
              without...

     He grins.  Has to admit...

                    MICHAEL
              ... without a thought in my head.
              I shouted, "Marry me."

     I did.  Now her eyes tear up again.  And she doesn't know why.

                    MICHAEL
              And she gasped, and covered her
              mouth, and the train was pulling
              out, and suddenly she screamed
              YES!  Just once.  And blew me a
              kiss.

     What a girl.

                    MICHAEL
              I never forgot that.

                    JULIANNE
              It's two weeks.

                    MICHAEL
              Almost three.

                    JULIANNE
              That is so romantic.

     Which makes him reach and touch her hair.

                    MICHAEL
              I just wonder if you know why.

     Do you?

                    MICHAEL
              It's because romance isn't
              mystery, and tricks, and doubts,
              and halting, unspoken longings.
              That's not the real romance.

     Tears in his eyes now.  First time.

                    MICHAEL
              The real romance is saying yes.

     Does she know that now?  He looks at his watch.

                    MICHAEL
                   (sighs)
              Woulda been a nice wedding.

     Oh.  That.

                    JULIANNE
                   (urgently)
              You can't believe you've lost
              her!  Sooner or later, you'll
              find her, and you'll look in
              each other's eyes, and you'll
              see all that love...

                    JULIANNE
              Course, if it's later rather
              than sooner, I'd hate to be you
              at six o'clock.
                    (beat)
              You've got a lot of explaining
              to...

                    MICHAEL
              I'm just thinking of how she's
              hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like
              her life is over.

                    JULIANNE
              That's little egotistical.

     He glares at her.

                    JULIANNE
              But, undoubtedly accurate.

     She claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.

                    JULIANNE
              Okay, we'll split up.  You go
              to every romantic place you
              guys have, I'll go... someplace
              brilliant, and the first one
              who...

                    MICHAEL
              If you find her...

     Strange tone.  A gentle warning.

                    MICHAEL
              The kiss.  May be hard.  For
              you to explain.
                   (beat)
              Because the only fear she
              really has, is...

                    JULIANNE
              ... me, yeah.  And she likes
              Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.

     Looks at her own watch.  Shit!

                    MICHAEL
              But if you do get to her first...

     She looks up.

                    MICHAEL
              There is something you are
              authorized to say.

     EXT.  TAXI STAND - DAY

     Julianne sits on the fender of this guy's taxi.  The driver smokes,
     paces, while she waits for a connection on her cellular.  Then...

                    MANDY (V.O.)
              Wallace egregious residence,
              Mandy speaking.

                    JULIANNE
              It's Jules, you guys haven't
              had a call from, say, Kimberly,
              have you?

                    MANDY (V.O.)
              Oh, she's slipped out, the
              little monkey.  Prob'ly with
              Michael, doin' the nasty.

     A shallow laugh...

                    MANDY (V.O.)
              Or crying in her nachos, down
              at Comskey Park.

     Julianne's face SNAPS to alert.

                    JULIANNE
              Ex-cuse me?

                    MANDY (V.O.)
              I had this crank call?  From
              some guy who thinks he saw her?
              I said, what would a bride be
              doin', on her wedding...

                    JULIANNE
              You are so right.  What a
              nerve on that guy!  Bring my
              dress to church, huh?

     Signals the driver, let's GO!

                    JULIANNE
              I want to pick up a little
              something for the ceremony.

     INT.  LUXURY BOX, COMISKEY PARK - AFTERNOON

     Game in progress.  Julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway
     of the deserted skybox.  Everyone Walter knows is going to a
     wedding.  The box is empty except for one cardboard container of
     nachos, extra cheese, sitting alone before a pulled-back chair.

                    BODYGUARD
              She wouldn't confide in me,
              so I called the house.

     He sighs.  Feels terrible about all this.

                    BODYGUARD
              Luckily, I got her cousin.

     Julianne nods.  Yeah, big break, there.

                    JULIANNE
              Going to the john, she said?

                    BODYGUARD
              Could be there awhile.

     INT.  WOMEN'S RESTROOM - AFTERNOON

     Julianne BURSTS into the enormous chaotic restroom.  Looks around
     wildly, no sign of Kim.

                    JULIANNE
              YO!  IMMIGRATION!

     Everybody stops.  Pays attention.

                    JULIANNE
              I GOT A WARRANT FOR MS. KIMBERLY
              WALLACE!

     Silence.  From the long line of stalls...

                    KIMMY
                   (O.S., sobbing)
              In here, you bitch!

     Now everybody's really interested.  Julianne ignores them, strides
     to the stall.  KNOCKS, like it's a door.  No answer.

                    JULIANNE
              Let me in, baby, or I'll rip
              this damn thing off its non-
              code-compliant hinges...

                    WOMAN (O.S.)
              GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY FACE OR
              I'M GONNA MESS YOUR SHIT UP!!

     Some scattered APPLAUSE.  From down the line...

                    KIMMY
                        (O.S., still sobbing)
              Over here, nitwit!

     Oh.  Scattered laughter.  Julianne moves down the line.  Stares at
     the door.  We hear the soft, muted crying from within.  Slowly,
     Julianne...

     ... drops to her knees.  Bends her head low.  PEERS under the door.
     What she sees, prompts a sad warning...

                    JULIANNE
              Incoming.

     And she crawls UNDER the door, on her belly.  We go WITH her to
     see...

     ... Kim fully dressed, perched on the closed toilet lid, her knees
     drawn up, her arms around them.

                    JULIANNE
              Pitiful.

     And pulls herself up to her knees.  Kimmy tries to glare, but it
     just isn't in her.

                    KIMMY
              Haven't you done enough?

     The world gets real quiet.  An entire bathroom is listening.
     Julianne cocks her head to one side.

                    JULIANNE
              In one minute.  You are going
              to feel so foolish.

                    KIMMY
              WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A
              STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?

                    JULIANNE
              Have you ever heard of.
              Irony?

     Irony? Kimmy sniffles.

                    JULIANNE
              I threw my arms around your
              husband.  And kissed him with
              all my heart.  Because I was
              so happy.  For you.  Nitwit.

     And leans close.  As Kimmy flinches.

                    JULIANNE
                   (whispers)
              He's going to take...
                   (big grin)
              The job!

     A stunned pole-axed moment.  And Kimmy's eyes SPRING open.  You
     mean...?

                    JULIANNE
                   (beaming)
              With your dad, yeah.  Can you
              guess why?  Bitch?

     Everything inside Kimmy BURSTS free in a torrent of tears...

                    KIMMY
              HE LOVES ME!!

     And DISSOLVES, sobbing, into Julianne's arms.  A beat, for Julianne
     to reflect, and then she strokes her tenderly.

                    JULIANNE
              Well, of course, he loves
              you.

     Kisses the top of Kimmy's head.

                    JULIANNE
                   (very soft)
              Hell, even I love you.

     Kimmy holds her tight.  From her heart...

                    JULIANNE
              I never want to go through this
              again.

                    KIMMY
              That's entirely understandable.

     ANGLES... outside the stall.  Julianne's feet sticking out under
     the door.

                    KIMMY (O.S.)
              Shit!  THE TIME!

     The two BURST out of the stall, hand-in-hand, at a desperate DEAD
     RUN past us.  HEAR them EXPLODE out the door, and...

     ... five stalls OPEN.  Women exit, crying.

     EXT.  UNIVERSITY CHAPEL - TWILIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of an ivy-covered CHAPEL, fronted by nearly
     a hundred souls, milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated
     curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety.  Our girls JUMP out of the cab,
     and half the crowd starts running toward us, twins in the lead...

                    SAMMY
              Whatever hap...

                    JULIANNE
                   (cutting this short)
              We were bonding, we lost track,
              we're officially sorry, now
              let's put it behind us.

     Kim WAVES at her mom by the chapel entrance.  And takes Julianne's
     hand for support.

                    JULIANNE
              Believe me, we got a bride who's
              worth waiting for, yes?

     Everybody nods.

                    JULIANNE
              Out of our way.

     EXT.  DRESSING ROOM - TWILIGHT

     White.  Pure blinding white.  Across FRAME floats more white, this
     gauzy and ethereal.  It settles, its roots planting deeply in the
     bride's hair.  TILTS UP to...

     ... the face of the woman who placed it there.  Julianne's eyes,
     appraising this bride we cannot see.  And so softly...

                    JULIANNE
              Don't worry, sugar.

     Don't worry.

                    JULIANNE
              When he looks at you, it will
              be as if...

     The words stronger.  Because there is no smile.

                    JULIANNE
              ... he's never seen a woman
              before.

     PAN DOWN the white until we are...

     CLOSE on the bride's perfect slippers.  HOLD.  And...

     INT.  CHAPEL - EVENING

     Begins to slowly PAN BACK UP the length of an exquisite gown.  We
     can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that
     we are nearing the moment.  We reach...

     ... Kimmy's hand.  Firmly clasping Walter's.  Keep PANNING, the
     bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are CLOSE on...

     ... the face of the bride.  Now we understand the word radiant.  We
     also understand scared senseless.  Our perfect, unflappable Kimmy
     is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic
     seamlessly blend.

     The organ's noddling stops.  Kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small
     animal bearing a predator approach her thicket.  Suddenly, the
     CHORD.  The Wedding March from Wagner's Lohengrin.  Here.  Comes.
     The bride.  And we SNAP TO...

     FULL ANGLE... Kim and Walter.  This is it.

                    WALTER
                   (whispers)
              Left foot.

     REVERSE ANGLE... Kim's POV, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck
     craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to
     where...

     Michael waits.  Also in a zone of pseudo-consciousness.  From which
     he attempts a smile.  Not comforting.  Kim's POV WHIP PAN the
     groomsmen, the twins, LOCKING FOCUS on Julianne, standing strong
     and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress.  She sends
     her little sister a WINK across the trackless miles of aisle.  You
     can do this, kid.  So...

     ... Kimmy does.  On her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the
     world's intrusive admiration.  One step at a time.  The most beautiful
     she will ever be.  She is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw
     up at the same time.

     And she's there.  At his side.  She glances back to her maid of
     honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net.  So
     Julianne...

     ... CROSSES her eyes.  Which lets the kid smile and finally take a
     breath.  Have a little fun, huh? Kim nods, got it, turns to...

     The Minister.  Who stands before them with a calming presence.
     Thank God someone has done this before.  The crowd has hushed.
     The Minister's eyes are only for two.  His words are for all...

                    MINISTER
              Michael and Kimmy wrote these
              words.  She asked me to confide,
              mostly Michael.

     A ripple of laughter.  Gentle and fine.  They are setting in.

                    MINISTER
              So he gets to say them.

     A surprise.  A pleasant one.  The crowd adjust in its seats.  As
     Michael begins...

                    MICHAEL
              Why do people get married
              anymore?

     And on these words.  We SNAP to Julianne.  Share her interest in
     the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Why not live together amicably,
              with no sense of obligation
              beyond the moment?

     Her eyes.  She's listening.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              As long as the sex is good.  As
              long as no one more interesting
              has wandered into view.  As long
              as the thousand conflicts of two
              individual wills remain
              comfortably compromised.

     PANNING now.  Other faces.  Isabelle.  Proud to the bone.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              And when one feels the urge to
              move on, to explore the new.
              No guilt, no disgrace, no
              promise broken.

     Walter.  His eyes damp.  Against our expectation.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              No agony of having dishonored
              a time.  When our hearts.  And
              the world were different.

     Joe nods, as he hears...

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Marriage is a lot to put up
              with.

     Julianne once more.  No breath.  Rapt.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              The answer must be.  That there
              is some need basic to the human
              heart.  That embracing... the obligation
              of commitment... fulfills.

     Her eyes have clouded.  As if Michael is talking to her.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Some need to belong to one another
              in a way which rages against the
              notion... that all is impermanent.
              Against the notion of mortality.

     And suddenly, ALL the feeling rises in her throat.

                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
              Our love is bigger.  And longer.
              Than life itself.

     And the tears come.  They come freely, unhidden, unnoticed.  As if
     they were needed.

     Michael now.  Looking at his bride.

                    MICHAEL
              That's what we want.  And marriage.
              Is what we do about it.

     Kimmy smiles at him.  With love bigger than life itself.

                    MICHAEL
              We are fools in this.  Thank
              God Almighty.

     He is done.  There is a silence.

                    MINISTER
              Boy, that was good!

     People LAUGH.  The Minister holds up a sheet of paper.  For the
     crowd to see.  Mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.

                    MINISTER
              Michael and Kim also edited what
              they want me to say...

     More laughter.

                    MINISTER
              The idea was, we're only marrying
              once.  We have to remember it
              forever.  Let's keep to the good
              stuff.
                   (squints at the sheet)
              You may kiss the bride.

     Bigger LAUGHTER.  The Minister waves this off, his little joke.
     Turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring.  As the hammered gold
     circle is handed to Michael, Julianne absently scratches her still-
     swollen finger.  Mandy taps Julianne on the arm, and produces...

     ... a matching ring.  Take it! Gives it to her.  So Julianne steps
     forward.  Places the second ring into Kimmy's waiting hand.  Their
     eyes meet, and hold throughout...

                    MINISTER (O.S.)
              If anyone here can show just cause
              why this man and woman should not
              be married, speak now.  Or forever
              hold your peace.

     Julianne CLEARS her throat.  Kimmy's heart flutters.  In the
     silence... Julianne's wonderful smile.  Just kidding.

     Michael reaches for Kim's hand, turns her gently to him.  Places
     his ring on her finger.  Holds her hands.

                    MICHAEL
              Kimberly.  I promise to love.
              And respect and comfort you.
              To hear your voice and your
              heart.  Until we are parted
              by death.

     She swallows.  Smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile.  Fumbles
     slightly, putting the ring on his finger.

                    KIMMY
              Michael.  I promise to love and
              respect and comfort you.  To
              hear your voice and your heart.
              Until we are parted by death.

     Staring in each other's eyes.  A moment so fragile, the Minister
     waits an extra beat.

                    MINISTER
              For the record, you each agree
              to marry the other?

                    KIMMY
                   (quickly)
              I do!

                    MICHAEL
                   (smiling)
              I do.

     The Minister joins their right hands.

                    MINISTER
              We haven't said much about God
              this evening, I know.  But He
              is here.  And He is happy.  To
              bless His wonderful children.

     CLOSE now on Julianne.  For the inevitable moment.

                    MINISTER (O.S.)
              In that Michael and Kimberly have
              given themselves to each other by
              solemn vows, and the exchanging
              of rings...

     Unnoticed by the world.  Her eyes are close.

                    MINISTER (O.S.)
              I pronounce them husband and wife.
              Those whom God has joined together,
              let no one put asunder.

     The eyes open.  Wet, brave, ready for...

                    MINISTER (O.S.)
              Now.  Kiss the bride.

     Julianne watching.  As Michael does.

     EXT.  WALLACE POND - NIGHT

     This is what all the preparation was for.  Tables, lights, balloons,
     the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo.
     The bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy.  Two who are one.
     PAN TO...

     ... the stage, the band playing.  Julianne conferring with the twins
     and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions.
     Then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone...

     ... KLUNKS it, for silence.  The band stops.  The dancers follow.
     All eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor.  She looks to
     the couple.  Just below her.  Then, to the crowd...

                    JULIANNE
              I'm a writer, too, not as
              good as Michael.  But I do
              steal from quality.

     She raises her glass.  Everyone at the table does the same.

                    JULIANNE
              This is to my best friend.  On
              the occasion of his wedding.

     Shouts of support, a few whistles.  Silence.  She tells Michael...

                    JULIANNE
              If I have truly come to know
              your bride as my new sister.
              This is in her heart...

     She has to stop.  Swallows.  Because she will not let herself cry.

                    JULIANNE
              "Understand.  I'll slip quietly
              away from the noisy crowd when
              I see the pale stars rising,
              blooming, over the oaks."

     Deep breath.  Looks in his eyes.

                    JULIANNE
              "I'll pursue solitary pathways
              through the pale twilit meadows,
              with only this one dream: You
              come too."

     A hush.  SHARP applause.  From four hundred hands.  But not from
     his.  He is too moved.  Too understanding of what he has heard.

                    JULIANNE
              I don't have a wedding gift.
              But this is on loan.  Until
              you two find your song...

     And with that the band begins.  The opening phrases of a song we
     have come to know.  Michael seems overwhelmed.  Julianne nods
     toward the gazebo...

     ... Michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into
     his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to
     applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (singing)
              Someday, when I'm awfully low,
                 And the world is cold,
              I will feel a glow just thinking of you,
                 And the way you look tonight.

     Soft two-part harmony.  As perfect as the words.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (singing)
              You're lovely.  With your smile so warm,
                 And your cheeks so soft,
              There is nothing for me but to love you,
                 Just the way you look tonight.

     Julianne can cry now.  Because she's tied with half the place.

                    MANDY/SAMMY
                   (singing)
              With each word, your tenderness grows,
                 Tearing my fears apart...
              And the laugh that wrinkles your nose,
                 Touches my foolish heart.

     Julianne begins to sing.  Unheard.  Unseen.  Even by the man she's
     singing to...

                    JULIANNE/MANDY/SAMMY
                   (singing)
              You're lovely, please don't ever change,
                 Keep that breathless charm,
              Darling, please arrange it, cos I love you...
                 Just the way you look tonight.

     The band keeps playing.  The dance goes on.  Two people lost in each
     other.  The way it's supposed to be.

     INT.  GREAT ROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Bedlam.  Julianne caught in the middle of the throng.  A young
     couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase.
     The SHOUT are deafening.  The bride has her bouquet...

     ... she spots Julianne far below.  THROWS it her way, Julianne
     reflexively GOES FOR IT...

     ... not a fucking chance.  The twins nearly TRAMPLE her in the
     stampede, Mandy WRESTING the prize from Sammy's grasp.  Everyone
     CHEERS, and then the couple is...

     ... FLYING down the stairs, RACING through the crowd with a
     protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door,
     for freedom...

     ... Julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple,
     struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty
     that she will never see him before...

     And then, he's THERE.  He has Julianne in his arms.  Holding her
     so tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad
     from the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her
     ear...

                    MICHAEL
              Wherever I go.  However far...

     She sobs.  Holds him.

     Deep, deep breath.

                    JULIANNE
              You win a few, you lose a few.
              Some get rained out.

     And to her surprise...

                    DIGGER
                    (V.O., very softly)
              You have a good time?

     To her greater surprise.  There are a few tears left, after all.

                    JULIANNE
              I did what I came to do.

                    DIGGER
                   (V.O., even softer)
              Good girl.

     She just can't speak now.  So she doesn't.

                    DIGGER (V.O.)
              I was thinking.  Maybe you might
              visit us for awhile.  We've got
              the room made up.

     This fucking guy.  God, she loves him.

                    JULIANNE
              I'll think about it.  I'm okay.

                    DIGGER (V.O.)
              Oh, you're more than okay.

     Just above a whisper...

                    JULIANNE
              You, too.

     And with the last of her strength...

                    JULIANNE
              If the sun comes up, I'll see
              you tomorrow, huh?

     A chuckle.  At the other end.

                    DIGGER (V.O.)
               I'll play those odds.  You have
               sweet dreams.

     We hear the CLICK.  She turns her back on the stars.  Shoulders
     straight.  Chin up.

     She walks from frame.

     FADE TO BLACK.  HOLD END CREDITS.
