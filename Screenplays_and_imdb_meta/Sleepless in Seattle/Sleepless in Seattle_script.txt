     FADE IN:



     CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN



     A card: Chicago.



     He's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp 

     dress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway.

     A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the 

     distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.



                     SAM

             Mommy got sick and it happened 

             just like that and there was 

             nothing anybody would do.

                  (continued)



     And pull back to reveal:



     EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY



     Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on 

     his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a 

     turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --



                     SAM

              If we start asking why we'll go 

              crazy.  So, rule number one.  

              We don't ask why.



                                   CUT TO:



     CLOSE ON ANNIE REED



     Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore 

     Orioles hat.



                     ANNIE

              Why? I just want to know why? 

              That's my first rule.  I always 

              ask why.  Come on.  Tell me.  

              C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --



     And pull back to reveal:



     EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY



     Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy 

     named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the 

     house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.  

     The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up 

     the back wooden staircase to the house.



                     SETH

              There's no why, Annie.  I'm 

              just not up for it.  I never 

              said I was.



                     ANNIE

              Is there somebody else?



                     SETH

              Nope.



                     ANNIE

              You don't love me, is that it?



                     SETH

              Nope.



     Follow them into:



     INT. KITCHEN - DUSK



     As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to 

     assemble them.



                     ANNIE

              How about ... you're too 

              narcissistic to commit to 

              another human being in a long-

              term way.



                     SETH

                  (agreeably)

              That's good.



                                   CUT TO:



     INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY



     An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are 

     stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a 

     months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly 

     in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window 

     that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of 

     flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.



                     SUZY

              Five minutes in the microwave.  

              Any one of them, five minutes 

              and done.  Ready to eat.  Do 

              you know how to make juice?



                     SAM

              Microwave.  Five minutes.



                                   CUT TO:



     ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER



     Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.



                     ANNIE

              You take the microwave?



                     SETH

              What am I going to do with a 

              microwave?



                     ANNIE

              You turn it on, you open it and 

              you stand in front of it for a 

              very long time.



                     SETH

              So you're angry.  Big deal.



                                   CUT TO:



     SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



     A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

     rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with 

     several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at 

     his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over 

     to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind 

     but a little stuffy.



                     ROB

              Young man, it's none of my 

              business, but maybe you should 

              talk to someone.  I myself 

              have consulted a professional.  

              I used to be up tight.



     On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more 

     uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out 

     of his shirt pocket and reads them off.



                     SAM

              Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...

              Loss of Spouse support groups...

              Single parent discussion nights...

              Parents without partners.

                  (starts riffling, angry)

              Partners without parents.  

              People who need people.  Guys 

              who go into the woods, beat 

              drums and bond.  Get a shrink.  

              Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.



     He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring 

     at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying 

     attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.



                     SAM

                  (continued)

              Don't mind him.  He's the guy 

              who just lost his wife.

                  (beat)

              What I really think is we need 

              a change.



                     ROB

              Good idea.  Take a few weeks 

              off, get some sun, take Jonah 

              fishing --



                     SAM

                  (shaking his head no)

              A real change.  New city.  

              Someplace where every time I go 

              around a corner I don't think 

              of Maggie.



     And hold on Sam for a moment and--



                                   DISSOLVE:



     EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY



     Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.  It's a 

     gorgeous day for a game.  They high-five each other.



                     ROB (V.O.)

              Where you going to go?



     And cut back to:



     INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY



     As Sam snaps out of it.



                     SAM

              I was thinking about Seattle.



     INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY



     The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her 

     nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her 

     boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.



                     LAURIE

              Honey, he wasn't right for you.



                     ANNIE

                  (blowing her nose)

              I know.



                     LAURIE

              He wasn't even wrong for you, 

              like cosmically wrong, so don't 

              beat up on yourself for 

              wasting...however long it was.



                     ANNIE

              I know.

                  (blowing her nose 

                   again)



     She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a 

     teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.



                     LAURIE

              Maybe you should see a shrink.



                        ANNIE

              I want my money.



                     LAURIE

              Go home for the weekend.



                     ANNIE

                  (after a beat)

              That's what I'm going to do.  

              I'm going to go home.

                  (she thinks about it)

              I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm 

              going back to Baltimore.

                  (she's giddy)

              How does a blonde do a high-

              five?



     She smacks herself in the head.



                                   CUT TO:



     O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY



     The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L.  Coming 

     down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son 

     MACK, and several other friends.



     And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a 

     couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.



     They pass each other going in diagonal directions and 

     continue on.



     We stay with Sam's group:



                     JONAH

                  (to Mack)

              Dad says I'm going to get used 

              to it, but I don't think you 

              can ever get used to a 

              designated hitter.



     overlap:



                     SUZY

                  (to Sam)

              Eventually, in a few months, 

              you'll start seeing women, 

              you'll meet someone.



                     SAM

              Move on.  Right.  That's what 

              I'm going to do.  In a few 

              months, boom, I'll be fine, 

              I'll just grow a new heart.



                     SUZY

              I'm sorry --



                     GREG

              Sam, she didn't mean --



     Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for 

     the Seattle plane.



                     SAM

              I know, I know.

                  (emphatic)

              Look, it doesn't happen twice.



                                   CUT TO:



     Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the 

     Baltimore plane.



                     ANNIE

              I'm going to meet someone, 

              someone nice and stable who 

              wears a hat so he won't catch a 

              cold, and I'm going to marry 

              him and have three children 

              and live happily ever after.  

              I mean, I am not cut out for this 

              --


                     DIANE

              For what?



                     ANNIE

              For life as we know it.



                     LAURIE

              Just make sure he isn't fat 

              like my Michael or you'll spend 

              your whole life worrying he's 

              going to drop dead.



                     JUDITH

              God, you guys are so romantic.



                     ANNIE

              Do you know how long romance 

              lasts?

                  (she snaps her fingers)

              That long.



                     DIANE

              Steven still brings me flowers 

              every Friday and we've been 

              married 10 years.



                     LAURIE

                  (to Diane)

              Honey, nobody wants to hear 

              that.

                  (to Annie)

              Here, darling, have some Tic 

              Tacs.



     Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded 

     with stuff.



                     ANNIE

              The next time you see me I am 

              going to be incredibly happy.



     INT. PLANE - NIGHT



     Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the 

     runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches 

     over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.



                     SAM

              I'm your dad.  Don't ever 

              forget that.  That's rule 

              number two.

                  (beat)

              It's you and me, kid.



     INT. PLANE - NIGHT



     Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the 

     runway.



                     ANNIE

                  (to herself)

              I guess it's just us.



     She gulps.



     EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT



     The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for 

     instructions.



     And now they both start to take off.  In opposite 

     directions.



     And we pull back back back back as the planes take off, 

     one flying east, the other flying west.



     And further and further back as they soar into the air 

     and leave the frame.



     The night sky.



     Stars twinkle.



     And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks 

     like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by 

     Saul Steinberg.



     A light goes on in Baltimore.



     A light goes on in Seattle.



     They are the only lights on the map.



     EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE



     As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER 

     JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're 

     carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're 

     walking toward the parking lot.



                     WALTER

              The short one with black hair 

              is your cousin Irene --



                     ANNIE

              -- who's married to --



                     WALTER

              Harold, who ran away with his 

              secretary but came back --



                     ANNIE

              -- because Irene threatened to 

              put the dog to sleep if he 

              didn't --



                     WALTER

              And your brother Tom is a 

              psychology professor and is 

              married to...Betsy --



                     ANNIE

              -- who is the most competitive 

              woman in the world --



     They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and 

     pull out together.



     EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT



     Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in 

     front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park 

     their cars.  They get out assembling presents.



                     WALTER

              Your Uncle Milton lost all his 

              money in a Puerto Rican 

              condominium that went belly up, 

              don't mention the IRS or the 

              Federal prison system.  Your 

              mother is Barbara, your father 

              is Cliff --



                     ANNIE

              I hope he doesn't get out his 

              slides.



                     WALTER

              Am I what they had in mind?



                     ANNIE

              They're going to love you.



     As they start toward the house.



                                   CUT TO:



     CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.



     AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



     INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT



                     BARBARA

              Everybody! Annie has an announcement --



                     ANNIE

              Walter and I are engaged!



     And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is 

     a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only 

     everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA, 

     a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman, 

     claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at 

     the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.  

     Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table, 

     along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE 

     MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.  

     There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.



                     IRENE

              That's wonderful, Annie.  I 

              hope it lasts... for years 

              and years.



                     BETSY

                  (the competitive one)

              Do you have a ring?



                     ANNIE

              No.  Not yet.



                     BETSY

              Oh.  Well.  How will anyone 

              know?



                     TOM

              Because you're going to call 

              them all and tell them.  

              Congratulations, Walter.



     He claps Walter on the back.



     Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.



                     CLIFF

              Are you all right?



                     WALTER

              It's nothing.  Nothing.



                     ANNIE

              It's probably just the flowers --



                     BARBARA

              We'll move them --



                     WALTER

              Don't touch them.  I feel 

              terrible sneezing at a time 

              like this.  This is a big 

              moment for me --



                     ANNIE

                  (overlapping)

              He's allergic to everything, 

              don't worry about it --



                     HAROLD

              Bees.  I'm allergic to bees.



                     CLIFF

              Not salmon I hope --



                     ANNIE

              If he eats one tiny piece of a 

              nut --



                     WALTER

                  (cheerfully)

              My head swells up like a 

              watermelon and I drop dead.



                     IRENE

              It's the same with Harold and 

              bees.



                     CLIFF

              Your mother and I had salmon at 

              our wedding, and I really think 

              a wedding without cold salmon --



                     WALTER

              I'm not allergic to salmon.  I 

              don't think.  But you never 

              know.



                     HAROLD

              You never know.



                     BARBARA

              Oh, honey, I feel terrible, we 

              used up this magnum of 

              champagne we were saving on 

              something else, what did we use 

              it for?



                     TOM

              Uncle Milton's parole --



                     BARBARA

              Right.



                     UNCLE MILTON

              And it was delicious.



                     BARBARA

              It was, wasn't it, Milton 

              darling --



                     BETSY

              When are you getting married, 

              Annie?



                     CLIFF

              In early June.  In the garden.



                     HAROLD

              Does it have to be in the garden?



                     IRENE

              What about Harold and bees?



                     BARBARA

              We'll spray you.



                     CLIFF

              Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumber 

              salad.  Strawberries.



                     WALTER

              I'm afraid I'm allergic to 

              strawberries.



                     CLIFF

              No strawberries.



     Annie smiles at Walter.



                     ANNIE

                  (to Walter)

              Is that all right with you?



                     WALTER

                  (to Lou Gehrig line)

              Today I consider myself the 

              luckiest man on the face of 

              the earth.



                     IRENE

              What are you wearing?



                     ANNIE

              I don't know.



                     BETSY

              I wish you would wear my dress.  

              I only wore it once, and you'll 

              barely have to do anything to 

              it except take it in in the 

              bust --



                     BARBARA

              I have something that might do 

              --



     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER



     Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides 

     of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room 

     Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas 

     carols.



     INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS



     MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to 

     burp.



     INT. ATTIC - NIGHT



     The sound of Christmas carols from below.



     The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with 

     her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a 

     sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful 

     antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.



                     BARBARA

              The Historical Society wanted 

              this and I never would give it 

              to them --



                     ANNIE

              Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.



                     BARBARA

              I notice these things are back 

              in fashion.  Oh, honey.

                  (tears are rolling down 

                   her face as she tries 

                   the veil on Annie)

              He's a lovely man, Annie.



                     ANNIE

              I know.  He's wonderful, isn't 

              he?



                     BARBARA

              Are his folks nice?



                     ANNIE

              You'll love them.  We're going 

              down to D.C.  tonight to be with 

              them Christmas morning.



                     BARBARA

              How did it happen?



     Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back 

     of the dress and remove it from the dummy.



                     ANNIE

              It's silly, really.  I mean, 

              I'd seen him at the office, 

              obviously I'd seen him, he's 

              the associate publisher, and 

              then one day we both ordered 

              sandwiches from the same place, 

              and he got my lettuce and 

              tomato sandwich on whole wheat, 

              which of course he was allergic 

              to, and I got his lettuce and 

              tomato on white.



                     BARBARA

                  (utterly without irony)

              How amazing.



                     ANNIE

              It is, isn't it? You make 

              millions of decisions that mean 

              nothing and then one day you 

              decide to order takeout and it 

              changes your life.



                     BARBARA

              Destiny takes a hand.



                     ANNIE

              Oh, please.  Destiny's just 

              something we've invented 

              because we can't stand the fact 

              that everything that happens is 

              accidental.



                     BARBARA

              Then how do you explain that 

              you both ordered exactly the 

              same sandwich except for the 

              bread? How many people in this 

              world like lettuce and tomato 

              without something else like 

              tuna?



                     ANNIE

              It wasn't a sign.  It was a 

              coincidence.



     Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie 

     steps into it.



     Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.



                     BARBARA

              I was in Atlantic City with my 

              family.  Cliff was a waiter.  

              He talked me into sneaking out 

              for a midnight walk on the 

              Steel Pier.  I've probably told 

              you this a million times, but 

              I don't care.  And then he held 

              my hand.  I was scared.  All 

              sorts of thing were going 

              through my head.  But after a 

              while I forgot about them.  At 

              one point I looked down, at our 

              hands, and I couldn't tell 

              which fingers were mine and 

              which were his.  And I knew.



                     ANNIE

                  (hearing it for the 

                   first time)

              What?



                     BARBARA

              You know.



                     ANNIE

                  (she doesn't know, but 

                   she doesn't want her 

                   mother to know she 

                   doesn't know)

              What?



                     BARBARA

              Magic.  It was magic.



                     ANNIE

                  (repeating)

              Magic.



                     BARBARA

              I knew we would be together 

              forever, and that everything 

              would be wonderful, just the 

              way you feel about Walter.  

              Walter.  It's quite a formal 

              name, isn't it?

                  (lowering her voice)

              One of the things I truly knew 

              was that your father and I were 

              going to have a wonderful time

              ... in the sack I believe you 

              call it --



                     ANNIE

              Mom!



                     BARBARA

              Of course it took several years 

              before everything worked like 

              clockwork in that department, 

              so don't be worried if it takes 

              a while --



                     ANNIE

              Mom, we already...



                     BARBARA

              Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da 

              dee.  And how's it working?



                     ANNIE

              Like... clockwork.



     She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit 

     at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is 

     higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.  

     The effect is quite comical.



                     BARBARA

              So you'll get married in a new 

              dress.



                     ANNIE

              It's a sign.



                     BARBARA

                  (gently)

              You don't believe in signs.



     EXT. STREET - LATE



     The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on 

     the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.



                     ANNIE

              They loved you.  I told you 

              they would love you and they 

              did.



                     WALTER

              I love you.



                     ANNIE

              I love you, Walter.

                  (beat)

              Did anyone ever call you 

              anything other than Walter?



                     WALTER

              Nope.



                     ANNIE

              Even when you were young?



                     WALTER

              Nope.  Not even when I was 

              young.



     It's starting to rain.



                     WALTER

              You sure you don't want to 

              drive with me?



                     ANNIE

              How will I get back to 

              Baltimore Saturday?

                  (remembering something)

              Oh God, I forgot my present for 

              your stepmother -- I took it 

              inside by accident.



                     WALTER

              I'll wait.



                     ANNIE

              Don't be silly.  I'll just be 

              ten minutes behind you.



     EXT. BELTWAY - NIGHT



     As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.



     Raining.



     INT. CAR - NIGHT



     Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's 

     singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects 

     and clipclops and giddyups.  After a moment, she 

     realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the 

     radio.



                     DR. MARSHA'S FIELDSTONE'S VOICE

              Welcome back to "You and Your 

              Emotions." I'm Dr.  Marcia 

              Fieldstone broadcasting across 

              America from the top of the 

              Sears Tower in Chicago where we 

              would have a fantastic view of 

              Santa Claus and his reindeer if 

              there was a -- oops, never 

              mind.  Tonight we're talking 

              about wishes and dreams.  

              What's your wishes this Christmas 

              Eve? Maybe the best present 

              you can give yourself is a call 

              to me.  The number is --



                     ANNIE

              Give me a break.



     Annie changes the station.



                     RADIO VOICE

              The subject of the evening's 

              medical update is You and Your 

              Spleen and our host --



     She flips the dial back the other way.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Our caller is from Seattle.



     Annie changes the station.



                     RADIO VOICE

              Coming up, Jingle Bells 

              backwards, sung by the New 

              Jersey Cape Mayettes --



     Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a 

     YOUNG BOY's voice.



                     BOY'S VOICE (V.O.)

              Hello, this is Jonah --

                  (there's a bleep as 

                   Jonah says his last 

                   name)



     Annie's hand lingers on the dial.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              No last names, Jonah.  Hello 

              there, you sound younger than 

              our usual callers.  How come 

              you're up so late?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              It's not that late in Seattle.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Got me there.  What's your 

              Christmas wish, Jonah?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              It's not for me.  It's for my 

              dad.  I think he needs a new 

              wife.



     Annie shakes her head.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              You don't like the one he was 

              now?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              He doesn't have one now.  

              That's the problem.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Where's your mom?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              She died.



     Annie closes her eyes for a moment.



                     ANNIE

              I don't believe this --



     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



     As the car drives along.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              I've been pretty sad, but I 

              think my dad is worse.



     INT. CAR - NIGHT



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              And you're worried about him.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              I'm worried about him, he's 

              worried about me, I ride my 

              bike to school, he follows in 

              the car, like I'm not supposed 

              to know he's there.  Now it's 

              Christmas, and you know what 

              happens to people at Christmas.



                     ANNIE

              They lose their minds and call 

              crackpot doctors on the radio --



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Have you talked to your dad 

              about this?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              No.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why not?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              It's very hard for him to talk 

              about this stuff.  It's like it 

              makes him sadder.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              You want me to talk to him?



                     ANNIE

              Perfect.  Sandbag the father.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              And you crazy? He thinks shows 

              like this are dumb.  If you 

              didn't have an 800 number I 

              could never get away with this 

              --



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Is he home right now?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              Yeah.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Well, I think I can help a 

              little more if I talk to him 

              directly.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              I don't know --



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              I'm sure he won't be angry once 

              he realizes how concerned you 

              are about him.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              Okay, but if I get yelled at, 

              I'm never gonna listen to this 

              show again.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Fair enough.



     INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the 

     houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord 

     coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's 

     standing near the kitchen end of a large living area 

     looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting 

     in a deck chair looking out at the sea.



                     JONAH

              Dad --



                     SAM

              What is it?



     ON ANNIE AGAIN.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              There's somebody on the phone 

              for you.

                  (into phone)

              His name is Sam.



                     ANNIE

              This is completely disgusting.



     INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as 

     he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is 

     a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.



                     SAM

              Hello.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia 

              Fieldstone on Network America.



     Sam looks across the room to Jonah.



                     SAM

              I'm probably not interested in 

              whatever you're selling.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              I'm not selling anything.  Your 

              son called and asked for advice 

              on how to find you a new wife.



                     SAM

                  (he really didn't get 

                   her name)

              Who is this?



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

                  (repeating herself)

              Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of 

              Network America.



                     SAM

              Jesus, are we on the air? 

              Jonah, for God's sake --



                     JONAH

              Don't be mad at me, Dad.



     Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately 

     feels how upset Jonah is.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              He feels that since your wife's 

              death you've been very unhappy. 

              He's genuinely worried about you.



     Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's 

     standing on.



                     SAM

                  (to Jonah)

              I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm 

              not mad at you.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              I think it's hard for him to 

              talk to you about all this.  

              Maybe we could talk and it 

              would make him feel a little 

              better.



     Sam hesitates.



                     JONAH

              Please --



     INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT



                     ANNIE

              This is a grotesque violation 

              of this man's personal life, 

              but never mind --



                     SAM (V.O.)

              All righ...



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Good.  How long ago did your 

              wife die?



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



                     SAM

              It's been about a year and a 

              half.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Have you had any relationship 

              since?



                     SAM

              No.



     Sam is very uncomfortable about this --



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why not?



                     SAM

              Look, Doctor, I don't want to 

              be rude, but --



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              And I don't want to invade your 

              privacy --



     INT. CAR - NIGHT



                     ANNIE

              Sure you do.



                     SAM (V.O.)

                  (overlapping)

              Sure you do --



     Annie smiles.



                     SAM

              Look, we had a tough time at 

              first, but I think I'm holding 

              my own as a dad, and Jonah and 

              I will get along fine again as 

              soon as I break his radio.



     Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Jonah is smiling too.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              I have no doubt that you're a 

              good dad.  You can tell a lot 

              from a person's voice.  But 

              something must be missing if 

              Jonah feels that you're still 

              under a cloud.



                     JONAH

              Tell her how you don't sleep at 

              night.



                     SAM

              How do you know that?



     Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally 

     talking to each other on the phone within their own 

     house, but also ON THE AIR.



                     JONAH

              I can hear you walking around 

              sometimes.  At first I thought 

              it was a robber.  Go ahead, 

              tell her, Dad.



                     SAM

              I don't think I have to now.



     Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts 

     toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.  

     On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.



                     SAM

              Look, it's almost Christmas --

                  (as the two of them sit 

                   down together on the 

                   bench)

              A kid needs a mother --



     He puts an arm around Jonah.



     INT. CAR - NIGHT



     As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Could it be that you need 

              someone just as much as Jonah 

              does?



                     ANNIE

              Yes.



     Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.



                     ANNIE

              I'm losing my mind.



     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT



     As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              We've been talking to -- well, 

              let's just call him Sleepless 

              in Seattle, and we'll be right 

              back after this break with 

              listener response, your 

              response, to the things we've 

              been discussing.  The number to 

              call is...



     INT. BALDWIN HOUSE



                     SAM

              What's she talking about?



                     JONAH

              This is where other people get 

              to call in and dump on what you 

              said.



     We hear the beginning of a commercial.



     INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT



     Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio 

     reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.  

     There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS 

     LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a 

     TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook, 

     is visible through an open window to the kitchen.



                     LORETTA

              I'll bet he's tall, with a cute 

              butt.



                     HARRIET

              I'll bet he hasn't shaved in a 

              week.  I'll bet he stinks.



                     LORETTA

              Shut up, Harriet.

                  (to Annie)

              What'll it be?



                     ANNIE

              Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.



                     LORETTA

              Maybe I should hustle myself 

              out to Seattle.  Give him a 

              little present for New Year's 

              Eve.



                     HARRIET

              You can go there if you want 

              but don't open his refrigerator.  

              They don't cover anything when 

              they put it in the fridge.  

              They just stick it in and leave 

              it there till it walks out by 

              itself.



                     LORETTA

              Harriet, ever since you 

              divorced your last husband, 

              you've been no fun.  I'm 

              looking, and this guy pops my 

              tarts.



                     TRUCK DRIVER

              Come on, Loretta, you're going 

              to have to jump-start this guy.  

              His battery's dead.  And look 

              at me.  Mister Ever-Ready.  

              Every six minutes, another 

              charge.



                     LORETTA

              I'm looking for someone 

              sensitive.



                     ANNIE

              Come on, nobody wants a guy 

              who's sensitive on the radio.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Let's take a call before we get 

              back to Sleepless.  Knoxville, 

              Tennessee, you're on.



                     SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE

              Yes, I would just like to know 

              where I could get this man's 

              address?



                     LORETTA

                  (to the radio)

              Honey, get on line.



     EXT. DINER - NIGHT



     As Annie gets into her car.



     EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.  STREET - NIGHT



     Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents 

     live.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Do you think there's somebody 

              out there you could love as 

              much as your wife? Maybe even 

              more?



                     SAM (V.O.)

              It's hard to imagine.



     And cut back and forth between the car and the 

     houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but 

     Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking 

     the boy's hair.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              What are you going to do, Sam?



                     SAM

              I don't know.  When I met my 

              wife, it was so clear.  I just 

              knew.



     Annie is listening now.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              What was it that made you know?



                        SAM

              I don't think I could really 

              describe it.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why not?



                     SAM

              And if I could describe it, 

              it probably wouldn't be on a radio 

              show.

                  (he laughs to himself)

              But what the hell.  It's not 

              one specific thing.  It's more 

              of a feeling.

                  (continued)



     Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in 

     Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now, 

     she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it 

     all.



                     SAM

              You touch her for the first 

              time, and suddenly... you're 

              home.  It's almost like...



                     ANNIE

              Magic.



                     SAM

              Magic.



     CLOSER ON ANNIE



     realizing she has just said this.  Realizing that it 

     must mean something but not knowing what.



     SHE'S CRYING.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Well, it's time to wrap up, 

              folks --



     A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which 

     Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with 

     her hand.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              We hope you'll call again soon.



     The figure TAPS on the window --



                     WALTER

                  (muffled, outside car)

              Annie?



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

                  ... and let us know how it's 

                  going.



     -- and taps again.



                     WALTER

              Annie?



     She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She 

     searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that 

     Walter can open the door.



                     ANNIE

              I'm sorry, Walter.  I just 

              heard the most amazing thing on 

              the radio.



     They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie 

     carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.



                     ANNIE

              People call up these shows and 

              you can't believe the stuff 

              they say.  It's the end of 

              privacy as we know it, this 

              country is just one big global 

              village with everyone out there 

              going blah blah blah --



     As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see 

     a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.



                                   CUT TO:



     A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS



     as we pull back to reveal:



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING



     As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut 

     from gift to gift:



     A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and 

     which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing 

     to open:



     A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his 

     neck.



     A PLAID SHIRT



     A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in 

     schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.



     And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind 

     the door and Jonah opens --



     A NEW FISHING ROD



     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



     As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his 

     tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new 

     plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam 

     takes his picture.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)



     Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he 

     made in woodworking class.



                     SAM

              The hopes are perfect -- 

              beautiful, identical, smooth -- 

              and they are for something 

              really amazing I feel it in my 

              bones --



                     JONAH

              It's a spice rack.



                     SAM

              We desperately need a spice 

              rack.  Desperately.



                                   CUT TO:



     INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY



                     SAM

              And we desperately need spices.



     Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper, 

     salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which 

     has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is 

     methodically making pancakes.



                     JONAH

              Dad?  About last night?



                     SAM

              It's never happening again.  

              Right?



                     JONAH

              Right.



     There's a knock on the door.



                     SAM

              Then it never happened.



     Sam goes to answer the door.



     TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing 

     quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It 

     says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.



                     SAM

              Hi.



                     LULU

              Hi.  Sam?



                     SAM

              Yes?



                     LULU

                  (looking in and seeing 

                      Jonah)

              You must be Jonah.



     Jonah nods.



                     LULU

                  (to her friend)

              See.  I told you.  Sam and 

              Jonah.  I'm LULU.  This is 

              JoBeth.



     JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.



                     LULU

                  (continues)

              We live two piers over, don't 

              we? Number 12, right? We're 

              having like a really neat open 

              house today from like four to 

              whenever if you care to stop 

              by.



                     SAM

              Thanks, but... we've got plans.



                     LULU

              Well, here's the number.  If 

              you ever find yourself 

              Sleepless, give us a call.  We 

              also... do babysitting.



     She winks.  JoBeth nods.



     Sam nods.



     Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down 

     the dock.



     Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.



                     JONAH

              Not.



                     SAM

              My feelings exactly.



     EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING



     Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.



                     SAM

              How many people do you think 

              heard that thing last night?



                     JONAH

              It plays in 50 states.



                     SAM

              What?!



                     JONAH

              Nobody else is going to know it 

              was us.



                     SAM

              You're right.

                  (after a beat)

              You better hope so.



     EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING



     INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY



     A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at 

     computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned 

     offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is 

     BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a 

     table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and 

     two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is 

     playing Gameboy.



                     KEITH

              This man sells the greatest 

              soup you've ever eaten, there's 

              a line around the block, and he 

              is, I am not kidding, the meanest 

              man in America.

                  (beat)

              I feel strongly about this, 

              Becky.  This is not just about 

              soup.



                     BECKY

              Do it.  What else?



                     WYATT

              New Year's Eve.  Please don't 

              make me write it.



     Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.



                     BECKY

              Wyatt, I do not mean to remind 

              you of your mother, but if you 

              don't put that game away, no TV 

              for a week.



                     WYATT

                  (pushing it to the 

                   center of the table)

              Would someone look this up, 

              don't tell me where.



     Becky is riffling through some papers on the table, 

     among which are some tearsheets from the Associated 

     Press wire.



                     BECKY

              Listen to this.  Phone service 

              in the greater Chicago area was 

              tied up for two hours Christmas 

              Eve because some kid called a 

              phone-in show to get a wife for 

              his father.  Two thousand women 

              called in for the number.



                     KEITH

              Jesus.



                     ANNIE

              I heard it.  This kid calls up 

              and says my dad needs a wife 

              and I'm talking to myself in 

              the car saying, this is 

              completely disgusting, you're 

              taking advantage of a child, 

              and then the father gets on and 

              this shrinkette says, do you 

              want to talk about it? And he 

              says no as a matter of fact I 

              don't, and I am saying, bravo! 

              Right on! Don't talk to her, 

              it's none of her business --

                  (she's completely into 

                   this story now)

              -- and then suddenly, for no 

              reason at all, he's talking 

              about how much he loved his 

              wife, and how he just --

                  (she snaps her fingers)

              fell in love with her and I am 

              crying.  Me.  A tear is 

              actually rolling down my face.  

              It was like what happens when I 

              watch those phone company ads.  

              I don't have to see the whole 

              ad, I just have to see the part 

              where the daughter gives her 

              mother a refrigerator with a 

              big red bow on it, have you 

              seen that one?



     Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.



                     BECKY

              You should write something 

              about this.



                     ANNIE

              About what?



                     BECKY

              Whatever it is.



                     KEITH

                  (waving the AP story)

              What it is is, there are a lot 

              of desperate women out there 

              looking for love.



                     WYATT

              Especially over a certain age.



     Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was 

     talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what 

     she was talking about.



                     KEITH

              It is easier to be killed by a 

              terrorist after the age of 40 

              than it is to get married --



                     ANNIE

              That is not true.  That 

              statistic is not true.



                     BECKY

              It's not true, but it feels 

              true.



                     ANNIE

              There's practically a whole 

              book about how that statistic 

              is not true --



                     WYATT

              Calm down.  You brought it up --



                     ANNIE

                  (sharply)

              I did not, Wyatt.



     A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of 

     hand.



                     BECKY

              So where were we?



                     WYATT

              New Year's Eve.  I'll do it, 

              okay?



                     BECKY

              Okay.



                     ANNIE

              If someone is a widower, why do 

              they say he was widowed? Why 

              don't they say he was widowered?



     Everyone looks at her strangely.



                     ANNIE

              I was jus wondering.



     EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY



     Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying 

     to catch up.



                     BECKY

              What was that about up there?



                     ANNIE

              What was what?



                     BECKY

              What's with you?



                     ANNIE

              Nothing's with me.



     INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY



     Becky and Annie are having lunch.



                     BECKY

              "Sleepless in Seattle"?



                     ANNIE

              That's what she called him on 

              the show.  Because he can't 

              sleep.



                     BECKY

              And now 2,000 women want his 

              number.  The guy could be a 

              crackhead, a psychopath, a 

              flasher, a junkie, a 

              transvestite, a chain-saw 

              murderer, or someone really 

              sick, like Rick.



                     ANNIE

              Actually, he sounded nice.



                     BECKY

              Oh? Oh, really? Now we're 

              getting down to it.



                     ANNIE

              Not.



     She reaches down for her purse.



     INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY



     A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle 

     newspaper, and



     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



     Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old 

     house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing 

     Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active 

     everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being 

     installed, tile being set.



     One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him, 

     and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for 

     them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older, 

     always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and 

     always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.



                     BOB LANGMAN

              Now she wants a circular 

              stairwell off the den.



                     JAY

                  (to Jonah, in b.g.)

              Punch me, punch in right here.

                  (points to his stomach;

                   Jonah punches)

              And she wants the Sub-Zero with 

              the side-by-side doors --



                     BOB

              Which means --



                     SAM

              The cabinets have to be redone 

              --



     They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a 

     nightmare.



                     BOB

              So we thought --



                     JAY

              Since you're on the make again 

              --



     Sam looks at Jonah --



                     SAM

              Great.  This is great.  The 

              whole town knows.  Just out of 

              curiosity, how do you two know?



                     BOB

              Grace heard it.



                     SAM

              Grace the dispatcher.  Great.



                     BOB

              The point is, take the client 

              out to dinner and ask her to 

              marry you and then maybe we 

              won't have to redo the kitchen 

              cabinets.



                     SAM

              Why me? What about Jay?



                     JAY

              Hey, my plate is full.



                     SAM

              Well, okay.  What's the big 

              deal?  If she'll forget the 

              new fireplace, I'll marry her.  

              Just point me in the right 

              direction.



                     JONAH

              Dad, I don't know about this 

              one --



                     SAM

              Oh, you're changing your mind 

              --



                     JONAH

              No, I'm not, but --



                     SAM

              What's the matter with this 

              one? Wouldn't you like to have 

              Imelda Marcos as your mother?



                     JONAH

              Dad --



     Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.



                     SAM

              We better take the measurements 

              for the new cabinets.



     He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and 

     starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in 

     another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay 

     tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into 

     the wall.



                     BOB

              Sam, if you're not doing 

              anything New Year's -- 

              obviously you're not doing 

              anything New Year's -- we're 

              having some people over, all of 

              them married, not one even 

              remotely interested in playing 

              around.  Does that sound great 

              or what?

                  (whistfully)

              I can't think of the last time 

              I was at a party when anything 

              actually happened.



                     SAM

              Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's 

              kind of a big night.  I don't 

              like to leave Jonah alone.



                                   CUT TO:



     SHOT OF  HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A 

     SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT



     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - TWILIGHT



     Jonah watching it.  Sam visible in the distance in the 

     kitchen.



     INT. KITCHEN - TWILIGHT



     As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.  He marks the 

     wall, hammers in the nails, etc.



                     SAM

                  (as he starts putting 

                   new spices into the 

                   rack, in alphabetical 

                   order)

              Does red pepper go under R or 

              P?



                     JONAH

              P.

                  (beat)

              Dad?



                     SAM

                  (absently)

              What?



                     JONAH

              I forgot to mention.  Jed 

              called --



                     SAM

              Just out of curiosity, do you 

              have any friends whose names 

              don't begin with a J?  I feel 

              like it was a failure of the 

              imagination on our part naming 

              you Jonah.

                    (looking at the spices)

              What is marjoram? Does anyone 

              know?



                     JONAH

              Jed is having a slumber party 

              New Year's Eve and he invited 

              me.



     A beat.



                     SAM

              Fine.  Fine.



                     JONAH

              So I can go.



                     SAM

              Sure.

                  (almost done with the 

                   spices)

              Looking good.



                     JONAH

              Shouldn't you have used a 

              toggle bolt?



                     SAM

              I think I know how to have a 

              spice rack.



     He puts in the last spice.



     They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls 

     off the wall.



     The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the 

     glass jars of spices break.



     There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all 

     over the floor along with shards of glass.



                     SAM

                  God fucking dammit!  Shit! 

                  Fuck.  Piss.



     Jonah bursts into tears.



                     SAM

                  (still angry)

              I'm sorry.

                  (softening)

              I'm sorry.



     He picks up Jonah and holds him.



                     SAM

              I'm sorry.  I'm just --



                     JONAH

              Stressed.



                     SAM

              Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm 

              sorry.



     And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.  Sam closes his 

     eyes tight.



     INT. A TELEVISION SET OF NEW YEAR'S EVE ON TIMES SQUARE



     And pull back to reveal:



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.  He's got a bag of 

     Doritos and a beer.



                     A VOICE

              Can I have half your beer?



                     SAM

              Sure.



     It's Maggie.



     She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a 

     glass.



                     MAGGIE

              What did I used to say? Here's 

              looking at you? Here's mud in 

              your eye?



                     SAM

              Here's to us.  You used to say 

              here's to us.

                  (he looks at her and 

                   his eyes well with 

                   tears)

              Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 

              hurts.



     He reaches out for her.  She's gone.



     And we hear the television set now counting down to 

     midnight in New York.



                                   CUT TO:



     INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT



     The same television show counting down to midnight.



     Champagne corks popping, etc.



     And we see Walter and Annie.



                     WALTER

              Happy New Year, darling.



                     ANNIE

              Happy New Year.



     They start to dance.



                     WALTER

              I was thinking, I have to go up 

              to Boston for the AAP 

              convention and then visit 

              Winston-Hughes about switching 

              over our computers.  Why don't 

              we meet in New York for 

              Valentine's Day weekend?



                     ANNIE

              Walter, I'd love to --



                     WALTER

              We'll stay at the Plaza --



                     ANNIE

              Go for a walk in Central Park --



                     WALTER

              Go to the Symphony --



     A beat.



                     ANNIE

              We will?

                  (beat)

              The Symphony?

                  (beat)

              Okay.

                  (beat)

              I'll take you to the Russian 

              Tea Room for pelmeni.


                     WALTER

              What is it?



                     ANNIE

              It's delicious, trust me.



                     WALTER

              Does it have wheat in it?



                     ANNIE

              I don't think so.



     They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 

     everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 

     looks thoughtful.



     ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY



     Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 

     his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.



     In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.



     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY



     Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 

     his face.



     A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 

     front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 

     for the mail.



                     JONAH

              Look at this, Dad.  They're 

              all for you --



     Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 

     addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 

     Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 

     stunned.  As he signs the receipt:



                     MAILMAN

              If you're having trouble 

              sleeping, you might want to try 

              drinking a glass of water from 

              the other side.



                     JONAH

              I thought that was for hiccups.



                     MAILMAN

              Does it work for hiccups?



                     JONAH

              For hiccups, a spoonful of 

              sugar, you hold it in your 

              mouth for a minute.



                     MAILMAN

              Really?



     The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.



     Sam and Jonah start toward the door.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 

     at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 

     found by the door.



                     SAM

              Just out of curiosity, how did 

              they get our address?



                     JONAH

              They called and asked for it.

                  (reading)

              "Dear Sleepless in Seattle.  

              You are the most attractive man 

              I've ever laid ears on."



     Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 

     rejects, opens another.



                     SAM

              How did they get our phone 

              number?



                     JONAH

              You have to give them your 

              phone number or they won't let 

              you go on the air.



     Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.



                     JONAH

                  (continues, reading)

              "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

              am an SWF"--

                  (to Sam)

              What is that?



                     SAM

              Thank God.  Something you don't 

              know.  It's a single white 

              female.



                     JONAH

              This is no good.  She's looking 

              for someone French.  Or Greek.

                  (puzzled, he throws the 

                   letter into the reject 

                   pile, opens another)

              "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 

              live in Tulsa." Where is that? 

              --



                     SAM

              Oklahoma.  Do you know where 

              that is?



                     JONAH

              Somewhere in the middle.



                     SAM

              I'm not going to think about 

              what they're not teaching you 

              in school.  I am not going to 

              think about it.

                     (beat)

              Generally speaking I think we 

              should rule out people who 

              don't live somewhere near here 

              --



                     JONAH

              She's willing to fly anywhere.



     As Jonah hands Sam the picture.



                     SAM

              She looks like my third grade 

              teacher.  I hated my third 

              grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait 

              a minute! She is my third 

              grade teacher!



                     JONAH

              Dad, you're not taking this 

              seriously.



                     SAM

              This is not how you do it.

                  (referring to the 

                   hamburger)

              You want this on an English 

              muffin or a bun?



                     JONAH

              English muffin.  How do you do 

              it?



                     SAM

              You see someone you like, you 

              get a feeling about them, you 

              ask them if they want to have a 

              drink or --



                     JONAH

              -- a slice of pizza --



                     SAM

              But not dinner necessarily on 

              the first date because by the 

              time you're halfway through 

              dinner you might be sorry you 

              asked them to dinner whereas if 

              it's just a drink, if you like 

              them you can always ask them 

              for dinner but if you don't you 

              can go home if you see what I 

              mean.

                     (beat)

              I wonder if it still works this 

              way.



                     JONAH

              It doesn't.  They ask you.



                     SAM

              I'm starting to notice that.



     INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Annie and Walter are making love.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              If you get a new wife, I guess 

              you'll have sex with her, huh?



                     SAM (V.O.)

              What do you think?



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              Will she scratch up your back?



                     SAM (V.O.)

              What?



     JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy 

     bear while this conversation concludes.



                     JONAH

              In the movies women are always 

              scratching up guy's back and 

              screaming and stuff.  When 

              they're having sex.



                     SAM

              Whose show was this on?



                     JONAH

              Jed's got cables.



                     SAM

              Go to sleep.



     He kisses him good-night.



                     JONAH

              Kiss Howard.

                  (he holds out the 

                   teddy bear)

              G'night, Howard.



     INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Annie and Walter have just finished making love.



     Walter falling asleep.



     Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.



     She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.



     INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE



     As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.



     She opens the door to the street.



     EXT. STREET - NIGHT



     As Annie starts to run down the street.



     CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING



     And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running 

     down.



     Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.



     Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.



     And another: Your feet are cold.



     And another: Will you find love.



     And another: Before you're cold?



     And another: Burma Shave.



     And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running 

     across a map of the United States -- it's a little like 

     the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's 

     like the famous map of the United States by Saul 

     Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one 

     is about Seattle.



     In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two 

     indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start 

     to wave at her, very slowly.



     Annie's eyes widen.



                                   CUT TO:



     INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep.



     She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did 

     in the dream sequence).



     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT



     As Annie comes down the stairs.



     INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE



     She turns the light on.



     Opens the refrigerator.



     Closes it.



     Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.



     Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes, 

     banana.  She's about to assemble it when:



     She sees:



     THE RADIO



     She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia 

     Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn 

     flakes.



                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

              Up next, "You and Your 

              Emotions" with Dr.  Marcia 

              Fieldstone, clinical 

              psychologist and the best 

              friend you never had.

                  (the teaser continues)



                     WOMAN'S VOICE (V.O.)

          He says he doesn't love me any 

          more.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why do you want to be with 

              someone who doesn't love you?



                     ANOTHER WOMAN (V.O.)

              Every time I come close to 

              orgasm he stops and goes to 

              make himself a sandwich --

     

                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why don't you make him a 

              sandwich beforehand?



                     SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

              When I met my wife, it was so 

              clear.  I jus knew.



     Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              What was it that made you know?



                     SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

              I don't think I could really 

              describe it.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Why not?



                     SAM'S VOICE (V.O.)

              And if I could describe it, it 

              probably wouldn't be on a radio 

              show.

                  (he laughs to himself)

              But what the hell.  It's not 

              one specific thing.  It's more 

              of a feeling.  

                     (continuing)

              You touch her for the first 

              time, and suddenly... you're 

              home.  It's almost like... 

              magic.



     Annie closes her eyes.



                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

              We'll be back after this 

              commercial with Dr. Marcia 

              Fieldstone.



     EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



     We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the 

     Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.



     INT. LIBRARY - DAY



     As Annie strides purposefully across the library and 

     enters:



     INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY



     Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his 

     desk.  We barely has time to look up.



                     ANNIE

              I think I'm going crazy, Tom.  

              I really do.  Are you happily 

              married?



                     TOM

                  (completely panicked by 

                   the question)

              What?



                     ANNIE

              I mean, why did you get 

              married? Was it all fireworks 

              and trumpets and --



                     TOM

                  (regaining composure)

              I got married because Betsy 

              said we had to break up or get 

              married.  So we get married.



                     ANNIE

              But when you met her, did you 

              believe she was the only person 

              for you? That in some mystical, 

              cosmic way, it was fated?



                     TOM

              Annie, when you meet someone 

              and you're attracted to them, 

              it just means that your 

              subconscious is attracted to 

              their subconscious, 

              subconsciously.  So what we 

              think of as chemistry is just 

              two neuroses knowing that they 

              are a perfect match.



                     ANNIE

              I don't even know him.  But 

              I'm having all these fantasies 

              about a man I've never met, 

              who lives in Seattle.



                     TOM

              It rains nine months of the 

              year in Seattle.



                     ANNIE

              I know, I know.  I do not want 

              to move to Seattle.  But what I 

              really don't want to do is end 

              up always wondering what might 

              have happened and knowing I 

              could have done something.  

              What do you think?

                  (Tom opens his mouth to 

                   say something, but 

                   before anything comes 

                   out, Annie fills the 

                   void)

              It's just cold feet, isn't it? 

              Everyone panics before they get 

              married, didn't you?



                     TOM

              Yes, I did.



                     ANNIE

              Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much 

              better just having blown this 

              off.



                     TOM

              Any time.



     INT. PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY



     As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.



     EXT. A DOOR OPENING TO SEATTLE STREET - DAY



     Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the 

     street.



                     JAY

              Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda

              ... She's a weightlifter, but 

              it's not like her neck is 

              bigger than her head or 

              anything --



                     SAM

              I'm not asking you to set me 

              up, Jay.  That's not what I 

              need your help for.  I want to 

              know what it's like over there.



                     JAY

              And that's what I'm trying to 

              tell you.  What women are 

              looking over, okay? Pecs and a 

              cute butt.



                     SAM

              You mean, like, "He has the 

              cutest butt"? Where did I hear 

              that recently?



                     JAY

              Everywhere.  You can't even 

              turn on the news without 

              hearing about how some babe 

              thought some guy's butt was 

              cute.  Who the first babe to 

              say this was I don't know, 

              but it caught on.



     INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - DAY



     Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see 

     water.



                     JAY

              When's the latest time you were 

              out there?



                     SAM

                  (trying to remember)

              Seventy... eight.



                     JAY

              Well.  Things are different.  

              First, you have to be friends.  

              You have to like each other.  

              Then you neck.  This can go on 

              for years.  Then you have 

              tests.  Then you get to do it 

              with a condom.

                  (beat)

              The good news is, split the 

              check.



                     SAM

              I don't think it could let a 

              woman pay for dinner.



                     JAY

              Great.  They'll have a parade 

              in your honor.  You'll be Man 

              of the Year in Seattle 

              Magazine.  Tira misu.



                     SAM

              What's tira misu?



                     JAY

              You'll find out.



                     SAM

              What is it?



                     JAY

              You'll see.



                     SAM

              Some woman is going to want me 

              to do it to her and I'm not 

              going to know what it is.



                     JAY

              You'll like it.



                     SAM

                  (grimly)

              This is going to be tougher 

              than I thought.



     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



     Sam coming home.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING



     As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet.



                     SAM

              Jonah?



     No answers.



                     SAM

              Jonah?



     He starts to look concerned.



                     SAM

              Jonah?



     He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is 

     shut.  He opens it.



     Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.  

     Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named 

     JESSICA.



                     SAM

              Jonah?



     Jonah takes off the earphones.



                     JONAH

              Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.



                     SAM

              It's nice to meet you, Jessica.



                     JONAH

              Dad, this is amazing.  If you 

              play this backwards, it says 

              "Paul is dead."



                     SAM

              I know.



                     JONAH

              How do you know?



     Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.



                     JONAH

              Dad, could you close the door?



                     JESSICA

              H and G.

                  (Sam looks back)

              Hi and goodbye.



     Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.



     Hold on Sam.



                     SAM

                  (to himself)

              Get a life.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS



     As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes 

     the door.



     INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS



     He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone 

     book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number.



                     SAM

              Hi, Victoria?... It's Sam 

              Baldwin, I don't know if you 

              remember me.  Oh?  Well, great.  

              I was wondering if you wanted 

              to have a drink... Friday, 

              say... Dinner?... Sure, dinner 

              would be fine.  Sure.  Dinner.



     INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM 

     - NIGHT



     Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television, 

     tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are 

     you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not 

     now."



     She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces 

     of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully 

     typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.



                     ANNIE

              Now those were the days when 

              people knew how to be in love.



     She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.  

     Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to 

     type and sob and look at the TV.



                     BECKY

              You're a basket case.



                     ANNIE

                  (as she types)

              They knew it.  Time, distance, 

              nothing could separate them.  

              Because they knew.  It was 

              right.  It was real.  It was...



                     BECKY

              ... movie.

                  (beat)

              That's your problem.  You don't 

              want to be in love.  You want 

              to be in love in a movie.

                  (beat)

              Read it to me.



                     ANNIE

                  (reading her letter)

              "Dear Sleepless and Son..."



                     BECKY

              It sounds like the name of a 

              mattress store --



                     ANNIE

              "I am not the sort of person 

              who listens to call-in radio 

              shows" --



     Becky flops on the couch.



                     BECKY

              And this woman is a writer! 

              That's what everyone writes at 

              the beginning of letters to 

              strangers.



                     ANNIE

              I know that.  You think I don't 

              know that? "I know that's a 

              dumb way to begin, but it's the 

              only way I can think of to 

              convey what happened to me the 

              other night when I heard the 

              two of you on the radio.  On 

              the other hand, maybe I'm just 

              losing my mind."



                     BECKY

              You are.  You're losing your 

              mind.  What about Walter?



                     ANNIE

              I'm going to marry Walter.  I 

              just have to get this out of my 

              system.



                     BECKY

              Right.



                     ANNIE

              I should say something in this 

              about magic.



                     BECKY

              What?



                     ANNIE

              I don't know.  I mean, what if 

              I never meet him? What if this 

              man is my destiny and I never 

              meet him?



                     BECKY

              Your destiny can be your doom.  

              Look at me and Rick.



                     ANNIE

                  (typing some more)

              "I want to meet you..."



     Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State 

     Building?"



                     BECKY

              "On top of the Empire State 

              Building at sunset on 

              Valentine's Day."



                     ANNIE

              Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New 

              York with Walter, I can squeeze 

              it in.



     She types in Becky's idea.



     Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter, 

     smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and 

     into Becky's lap.



                     BECKY

              You want to hear about destiny? 

              If my husband hadn't gone on a 

              diet, which caused me to leave 

              him, I would never have been on 

              that flight to Miami, and met 

              Rick, and ended up having sex 

              in the bathroom of a 727 with 

              that nob you slide that says 

              "vacant-occupied, vacant-

              occupied, vacant-occupied" --

                  (she shudders in 

                   ecstasy, then pulls 

                   herself together)



                     ANNIE

              You never told me you left your 

              husband because he went on a 

              diet.



                     BECKY

                  (nods; after a beat)

              He lost all the weight... 

              there.



                     ANNIE

              That's impossible.  A guy can't 

              --



                     BECKY

              Can too.



                     ANNIE

              No.



                     BECKY

              Yes.



                     ANNIE

              And then you left him? He lost 

              weight there and you left him?



                     BECKY

              Plus he fell in love with a 

              temp.



                     ANNIE

              Listen to this, I love this 

              part --



     Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant 

     says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by." 

     Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no 

     warm memories."



     Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.



                     BECKY

              Men never get this movie.



                     ANNIE

              I know.



                     BECKY

              Do you think at the end of the 

              movie when she's in the 

              wheelchair they can still do 

              it?



                     ANNIE

              I always wondered about that 

              too.



     As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.



     INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM



     A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to 

     Jonah, who's up.  His hair is mated with perspiration.



                     SAM

              It's okay, it's okay.  I'm 

              here.



     A beat while Jonah calms down.



                     JONAH

              It was sinking.



                     SAM

              What was?



                     JONAH

              Our house.  There was water 

              coming in all the windows.



                     SAM

                  (calm and definite)

              You're worried we're going to 

              be all right.  We're going to 

              be all right.

                  (Sam gives Jonah a 

                   squeeze)

              I remember sometimes you'd have 

              nightmares as a baby.  Your mom 

              would hold you and rock you and 

              sing you a song.



                     JONAH

              Bye bye blackbird.



                     SAM

              Is that what she used to sing?



                     JONAH

              I miss her.

                  (beat)

              What do you think happens to 

              someone after they die?



                     SAM

              I don't know.



                     JONAH

              Like do you believe in heaven?



                     SAM

              I never did.  Or the whole idea 

              of an afterlife.  But I don't 

              know any more.  I have these 

              dreams about... your mom... and 

              we have long talks about... 

              about you, and how you are, 

              which she sort of knows but I 

              tell her anyway.  So what is 

              that? It's sort of an afterlife, 

              isn't it?



                     JONAH

              I'm starting to forget her.



                     SAM

              I know.  But she's here, Jonah.  

              Because I have you.  And as 

              long as I have you, I have your 

              Mom.



     Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye 

     Blackbird.



                     SAM

              I... uh... have a date with 

              someone Friday night.



                     JONAH

              Good.



     A beat.



                     SAM

              Did I ever tell you about the 

              time I ate a dog biscuit?



     As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK 

     FROM THE BED AND...



                                   CUT TO:



     EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT



     AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her 

     car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and 

     stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and 

     think.  She crosses the street into a little 

     neighborhood park.  We can see the moon.



                                   CUT TO:



     EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck 

     chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon.  

     The MUSIC CONTINUES.



                                   CUT TO:



     EXT. PARK - NIGHT



     Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.  

     MUSIC CONTINUES.

     CLOSE ON SAM



     CLOSE ON ANNIE



     AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING



     As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled 

     out of.  Annie starts toward him.



     A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT



     Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late 

     tonight, blackbird, bye bye.



     FADE IN:



     INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY



     Annie on the phone at her desk.



                     ANNIE

              Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'm 

              fine.  Listen, I'm doing an 

              article on call-in radio shows.  

              Do you know anyone who works 

              for someone named Dr. Marcia 

              Fieldstone...?

     Annie on the phone.



                     ANNIE

              I'm a writer for the Baltimore 

              Sun and I'm a friend of Laurie 

              Johnson's.  I'm doing a piece 

              on how people handle 

              bereavement and I understand 

              that you had a caller the other 

              night... I know you're not 

              supposed to, but Laurie said 

              you might, and I'll plug the 

              show and everything --

                  (she winces in 

                   anticipation of a 

                   rejection, but then 

                   her face relaxes)



                                   CUT TO:



     Annie dialing Sam's telephone number.

              not in right now but you can

     Annie hangs up.



                     ANNIE

                                   CUT TO:



     Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number.  

     We hear some beeps.

     A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE



     that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of 

     Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that 

     kind of grainy quality that things have when they've 

     been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good 

     looks.



     EXT. BO'S SECURITIES/WORLDWIDE - DAY



     Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in 

     downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.  

     Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-

     chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.



     The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All 

     major credit cards accepted." And then everything on 

     the sign is translated into Spanish.



     INT. BO'S SECURITIES - DAY



     Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk 

     listening to Annie.  He has some papers.



                     ANNIE

              I need to know about him 

              because... he's involved with 

              my sister...



                         DET. WHEEDLE

              Okay.



                     ANNIE

              She has a pattern of getting 

              involved with losers... Once 

              she almost ran away with a 

              human cannonball from the 

              circus.



                     DET. WHEEDLE

              Do you want a matrimonial, past 

              wives, any kids--



                     ANNIE

              No, I know that part --



                     DET. WHEEDLE

              So you want a financial, is he 

              a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --



                     ANNIE

              No, no, no, it's more like, who 

              is he, does he have a sense of 

              humor, is he nice -- no forget 

              nice, I've got nice --



                     DET. WHEEDLE

              A sense of humor.



                     ANNIE

              I'll tell you the truth, I 

              heard this guy on a call-in 

              radio show and I might not 

              marry the person I should marry 

              because I've become obsessed 

              with him.



                     DET. WHEEDLE

              Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that 

              movie.



                     ANNIE

              No.  Not remotely.  I just want 

              to find out about him.



                     DET. WHEEDLE

              You want a tail.

                  (picking up the phone)

              I got a guy in Seattle --



     INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE, 

     17.

     Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed 

     WOMAN.



                     GERALDO

              So how long have you been a 

              woman?



                     WOMAN

                  (husky voice)

              About two weeks.



     Sam is coming down the stairs.



                     CLARISE

                  (to Jonah)

              Pssst!



     Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to 

     the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed 

     for his date.



                     SAM

              Clarise, I'll be back by 

              midnight I'm sure --



                     CLARISE

              Whenever.



     Sam tosses Jonah a letter.



                     SAM

              This one's for both of us.



                     JONAH

                  (reading from the 

                   envelope)

              Sleepless and Son.

                  (reading the postmark)

              Baltimore.



     He starts to open the letter.



                     SAM

              I left the number of the 

              restaurant I'll be at if 

              there's any emergency.



                     CLARISE

              Fine.



                     SAM

                  (to Jonah)

              How do I look?



                     JONAH

                  (absently)

              Great.



                     SAM

                  (looks in mirror)

              I look stupid.  I look stupid, 

              don't I? I look like I'm 

              trying too hard.  I was going 

              to get a haircut but then I 

              thought I'd look like I just 

              got a haircut.

                  (checks his teeth, 

                   peers up his nose)



                     JONAH

                  (reading the letters)

              This is a good letter, Dad.



                     SAM

                  (checks his fly, looks 

                   down at his feet)

              The heels on these shoes are 

              very large.  Why have I never 

              noticed this? The heels on 

              these shoes are grotesque.



                     JONAH

              Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.



                     SAM

              Now I'm late.  Bye.



     He starts toward the door.



                     JONAH

              Listen to this --



                     SAM

              Not now, Jonah --



                     JONAH

              Just this one part, okay?

                  (reading)

              "I have been an excellent 

              third-baseman for as long as I 

              or anyone else can remember, 

              and I guarantee you will not 

              get one past me"



                     SAM

              Jonah, I'm leaving --



                     JONAH

              WAIT!!!

                  (Sam stops, amazed at 

                   Jonah's vehemence; 

                   Jonah continues 

                   reading)

              -- "and while we're on the 

              subject, let's just say right 

              now that Brooks Robinson was 

              the best third baseman ever.  

              It's important that you agree 

              with me on that because I'm 

              from Baltimore."  Dad, she 

              thinks Brooks Robinson is the 

              greatest.



     Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the 

     letter.


     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



                     JONAH

              Dad!



                     SAM

              Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson 

              is the greatest.



                     JONAH

              It's a sign.



                     SAM

              Oh, right.



     Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back 

     into the house.



                     SAM

              Come here.  I want to show you 

              something.



     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT



     As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is 

     hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah 

     in front of it.



                     SAM

              Here is Seattle.

                  (moves his finger 

                   across the country)

              And here is Baltimore.  Case 

              closed.

                  (he pulls the map and 

                   it snaps back up)



                     JONAH

              She doesn't want us to go to 

              Baltimore.  She wants to meet 

              us in New York City on 

              Valentine's Day.  On top of the 

              Empire State Building.



                     SAM

              Perfect.  We'll be there.



     Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his 

     letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back 

     to Geraldo.



     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT



     Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.  

     He looks up and spots:



     VICTORIA



     walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves 

     and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer 

     from the maitre d'.



     After a beat.



                     SAM

              Hi.



                     VICTORIA

              Hi.



     An awkward pause.



                     SAM

              You look good.



                     VICTORIA

              You look good yourself.



     Another pause.



                     VICTORIA

              I thought you were never going 

              to call me.



                     SAM

              You did?



                     VICTORIA

              I really wanted you to call me, 

              and I thought you were never 

              going to --



                     SAM

              You could have called me --



                     VICTORIA

              No way.  No way I was going to 

              be the first woman you went out 

              with after...

                  (she gestures 

                   helplessly)

              There is no percentage 

              whatsoever in being the first 

              woman anyone goes out with 

              after...



                     SAM

              You are the first woman I'm 

              going out with.



                     VICTORIA

              Oh.



                     SAM

              So whatdya say? I'll get the 

              check, and I'll call you in 

              eight months.



     Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.



                     VICTORIA

              Oh, you are funny --



     We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.



                                   CUT TO:



     SEATTLE DETECTIVE



     sitting at a table across the room, having just taken 

     the picture of Sam we saw frozen, with a miniature 

     camera.  In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later 

     photographs:



     SAM AND VICTORIA SIMPLY TALKING.



     SAM HOLDING HIS FORK ACROSS THE TABLE TO GIVE VICTORIA 

     A BITE OF HIS SALMON.



     SAM AND VICTORIA SHARING A LAUGH.



                                   CUT TO:



     INT. BALTIMORE MARKET - DAY



     Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is 

     walking with Det. Wheedle toward a table you stand at 

     near the clam bar.



                     ANNIE

              Tell me he's living in squalor.  

              Tell me everything he has is 

              being repossessed, including 

              his filthy, dented mobile home.



                     WHEEDLE

              He's got a houseboat.



                     ANNIE

              I hate boats.



                     WHEEDLE

              It sounds nice.



                     ANNIE

              Boats.  You go out in them.  

              You come back in them.  I hate 

              them.



                     WHEEDLE

              Houseboats don't go anywhere.



                     ANNIE

              Boats.  All anyone talks about 

              is the wind.  Is it up, is it 

              down.  I can't live with a man 

              who only talks about the wind.



                     WHEEDLE

              It's not a boat boat.  It's 

              really a house.



                     ANNIE

              But it's on the water.



                     WHEEDLE

              It's on the lake right in the 

              middle of Seattle.

                     (beat)

              It rains nine months of the 

              year in Seattle.



                     ANNIE

              I hope I don't have to pay for 

              that piece of information.



                     WHEEDLE

              No, that's free.  He's an 

              architect.  Used to do big 

              high-profile projects.  He 

              scaled it all back when his 

              wife died.  Now he remodels 

              people's homes.  He works in 

              a small firm, makes a good 

              living.



     He shows her a good picture of him.



                     ANNIE

              He's real.



     She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and 

     Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of 

     Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.



     Hold on Annie's face.



     INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE



     With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost 

     identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.



     Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking 

     around, slightly distracted.



                     JONAH

              I figure we could go to New 

              York, catch the Knicks, and 

              since we'd be there anyway, 

              obviously we'd go to the Empire 

              State Building --



                     SAM

              There she is.



     As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of 

     groceries.



                     JONAH

              Why is she bringing that bag?



                     SAM

              She's going to cook something 

              for us?



                     VICTORIA

              Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- 

              you must be Jonah.



                     JONAH

              Hi.

                  (back to the subject)

              He should book now because we 

              can get an excursion fare.  

              Jessica's parents are travel 

              agents and --



                     SAM

              Not now, Jonah.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER



     Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table, 

     finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.



                     SAM

              We can't finish the job.  She's 

              on her sixth painter, now she's 

              thinking maybe she wants the 

              fireplace rebricked --



                     VICTORIA

              I know her pretty well.  Maybe 

              I could call her --



                     SAM

              I've already solved it.  I've 

              hired a hit man.



     Victoria laughs a little too hard.



                     VICTORIA

              Oh that is so funny, you are so 

              funny.



     Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled.



                     SAM

              Every time she wants to change 

              something, she talks in this 

              little baby voice --

                  (in a little baby 

                   voice)

              "Couldn't you just move the 

              stairway a teeny tiny bit?"--



     Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to 

     slits.



                     JONAH

              Do you like baseball?



                     VICTORIA

              Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has 

              box seats for the Mariners.  

              Why don't we all go next week?



                     JONAH

              What about camping?



                     VICTORIA

              What about it?



                     JONAH

              Do you like it?



                     VICTORIA

              I went camping once.

                  (to Sam)

              I love to brush my teeth in a 

              brook and floss with a weed.



                     JONAH

              We ought to start camping 

              again, Dad.



                     SAM

              Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.



                     JONAH

              It's only ten o'clock.



                     SAM

                  (a little edgy)

              Jonah!



                     JONAH

              Okay.



                     SAM

              Thank Victoria for dinner.



                     JONAH

              Thanks for dinner.  I never saw 

              anybody cook potatoes that way.



                     SAM

                  (gracious)

              I'm glad you liked it.  Good 

              night, Jonah.



     They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.



     EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - REAR DECK - ON SAM & VICTORIA



     They're standing at the rail, talking.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window 

     at them.



     Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.



     Jonah is horrified.



     He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.



     INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the 

     ringing of her phone.



                     ANNIE

                  (groggy)

              Hello.



                     BECKY

                  (through filter)

              Turn on your radio!



                     ANNIE

              What?



                     BECKY

                  (through filter)

              The kid is on.  You've got me 

              listening to this garbage.  

              Go on, turn it on.



                     WALTER

              Who is it?



                     ANNIE

              Oh, it's just Becky, she's 

              having trouble with Rich again.

                  (into phone)

              Hold on, Becky, I'm going 

              downstairs.



     She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.



     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT



     As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up 

     the phone.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

              This is a complete disaster.  I 

              wanted him to find a wife, but 

              he's got the wrong one --



                     ANNIE

              How am I going to explain this 

              to Walter?



                     BECKY (V.O.)

              Shhh, listen to this --



     Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone 

     receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself 

     inside.



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Shouldn't your father be the 

              judge of whether she's right 

              or wrong?



     ON JONAH



     sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.  

     Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps 

     them behind him.



                     JONAH

              Please, please don't make me 

              sick.  He's not sane enough to 

              judge anything.  She's a ho.



     ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BROOM CLOSET, WITH THE TELEPHONE 

     CORD LEADING INTO IT.



                     JONAH (V.O.)

                  (muffled slightly)

              My dad's been captured by a ho.



     Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.  Jonah 

     ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.



     EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware 

     that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.



                     VICTORIA

              Is he there?



                     SAM

                  (turning back)

              No.

                  (beat)

              After he was born, every time 

              we started to make love, he 

              would cry.  He had an uncanny 

              sense of timing.  We really 

              shouldn't do anything here 

              anyway.



                     VICTORIA

              Absolutely.  Right.



     And she moves in to kiss him.



     ON JONAH



     Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the 

     coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a 

     kiss.



                     JONAH

              Oh God, it's major.  He's 

              kissing her on the lips.  I 

              have to stop this.



     ON BROOM CLOSET



                     ANNIE

                  (muffled)

              Come on, Jonah --



                     BECKY (V.O.)

              Do something --



     ON JONAH



                     DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V.O.)

              Jonah, you can't butt in here.



                     JONAH

              Yes, I can.



     He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.



                                   CUT TO:



     ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.



     SHE SCREAMS.



     It's Walter.



                     WALTER

              Miss Scarlett.  In the broom 

              closet.  With the radio.



                     ANNIE

                  (to Becky)

              I gotta go.  I'll see you at 

              work.

                  (she hangs up, turns 

                   off radio)

              Walter, you scared me.  Don't 

              ever do that again.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     As Sam holds Jonah by the shoulders.



                     SAM

              Don't ever do that again.



                     JONAH

              I thought I saw a black widow 

              spider.



     Sam looks at Victoria, shrugs.  Back to Jonah.



                     SAM

              What are you doing up?



                     JONAH

              I was thirsty.



                     SAM

              There's a bathroom upstairs.



                     JONAH

              The water tastes better in the 

              kitchen.



                     SAM

              That's true.  Why is that?



     INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT



     As she and Walter go upstairs to bed.



                     ANNIE

              Becky heard this woman on the 

              radio complaining about this 

              guy she was sure was Rick, 

              which meant he was cheating on 

              her.  She was completely 

              hysterical.  Then it turned out 

              the woman lived in Duluth.



                     WALTER

              That doesn't make any sense.



                     ANNIE

              I know.  It makes no sense at 

              all.  Thank God my life is in 

              place.



     INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Walter asleep.  Annie stares up at the ceiling, wide 

     awake.  Thinking.



     INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling, 

     wide awake.  Thinking.



     INT. JESSICA'S PARENTS' TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY



     Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.  She's sitting 

     at a computer in their travel agency, which is on the 

     entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah 

     sitting there.



                     JESSICA

              Write her.



                     JONAH

              You think so?



                     JESSICA

              It's Y. O. H.



                     JONAH

                  (agreeing)

              Yeah.

                  (a beat)

              What's that?



                     JESSICA

              Your only hope.



     INT. NEWSROOM - DAY



     Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.



                     ANNIE

              I thought I would look into 

              doing a story about those radio 

              shows.



                     BECKY

                  (nods; after a beat)

              You'd probably have to go 

              somewhere to really look into 

              it.



                     ANNIE

              Definitely.



     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER



     Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the 

     mailbox and drops the letter in, we hear a SQUEAL OF 

     BRAKES.  It's Sam's car.



                     SAM

                  (angry)

              Get in the car right this 

              minute.



     Jonah, about to get in, looks at Jessica.



                     JESSICA

              I'll call you later.



     Jonah gets in.



     INT. SAM'S CAR - CONTINUOUS



                     SAM

              Did you call that radio station 

              again?



                     JONAH

              No.



                     SAM

              Everyone at work heard you.



                     JONAH

              I just called for a second.



                     SAM

              Long enough to call Victoria a 

              ho.



                     JONAH

              It's a short word.



                     SAM

              This is not a joke.  Thank God 

              Victoria doesn't know.  It 

              would really have hurt her 

              feelings.



                     JONAH

                  (really getting into 

                   it)

              If she knew, she'd never 

              forgive me.  It would be 

              hopeless for the two of you.



     EXT. SEATTLE STREET - CONTINUOUS



     As the car drives off.



                     SAM (V.O.)

              Don't open your mouth again.  

              Ever.



     EXT. A CAR DOOR SLAMMING - NIGHT



     And pull back to reveal:



     EXT. BALTIMORE RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT



     As Annie and Walter get out of the car, dressed for a 

     dinner.



                     WALTER

              Couldn't you just do a phone 

              interview?



                     ANNIE

              Not for the kind of place I 

              want to do.  I won't be in 

              Chicago that long.



                     WALTER

              When you get back, I'll be 

              gone --



                     ANNIE

              And then I'll see you in New 

              York --



                     WALTER

              Okay, okay.



     EXT. BALTIMORE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY



     A 747 accelerates down the runway and blasts into the 

     winter sky.



     INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY



     Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied.



                     PILOT'S VOICE

              This is Captain Foster 

              welcoming you aboard Flight 132 

              to Seattle.  Our flying time 

              today...



                     ANNIE

              Do you believe that any lie is 

              a betrayal? That's what Harold 

              Pinter says, but it seems to me 

              it's a very harsh way of 

              drawing the line.



     Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate, 

     who in any case doesn't speak English, completely 

     mystified.



     INT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



     Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate, 

     watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound 

     for Minneapolis.



                     VICTORIA

                  (turning to Jonah)

              Can I bring something back for 

              you? A souvenir?

                  (to Sam)

              Does he like those little snow 

              scenes?

                  (to Jonah)

              You know -- you shake them up 

              and the snow floats down?



     Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.



                     JONAH

                  (extremely polite)

              Sure.  I'd really like that.  

              Thank you so much.



                     VICTORIA

              Well...



                     JONAH

              I think they're announcing your 

              flight.



     Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.



                     SAM

              He's ten.



                     VICTORIA

                     (he's good at it)

              He's good at it.



                     SAM

              I read an article about this

              ...



                     VICTORIA

              I read the same article...



                     SAM

              It takes time --



                     VICTORIA

              Absolutely.  When I come back, 

              maybe the two of us should 

              spend some time together, on 

              our own.  What do you think?



                     SAM

              Sure.  Sure.



     Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.  

     As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his 

     finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.



                     SAM

                  (impatiently)

              Jonah, this isn't fair.  You 

              don't know Victoria.  I hardly 

              know her myself.  She is, in 

              fact, a mystery to me.  She 

              tosses her hair a lot.  Why 

              does she do this? I have no 

              idea.  Is it a twitch? Does 

              she need a haircut? Should she 

              use barrette so it doesn't 

              keep falling in her face? 

              These are things that I'm 

              willing to get to the bottom 

              of, and that is why I am dating 

              her.  That is all I am doing.  

              I am not marrying her.  Can you 

              appreciate the difference? 

              That's what single people do, 

              they try people on and they see 

              if they fit.  But nobody fits 

              perfectly, everyone is an 

              adjustment.



                     JONAH

              Was Mom an adjustment?



                     SAM

                  (complete exasperation)

              I'm never going to meet anyone 

              who's going to measure up to 

              your mom in your eyes? What do 

              you think? There's a perfect 

              woman walking around out there?



     At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next 

     to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.



                     SAM

              There's no such thing as a 

              perf --



     Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by 

     her looks, her fluidity, her poise.



     Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches 

     from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.  

     Sam continues to stare at her.



                     SAM

                  (to himself, referring 

                   to Annie)

              God, she's beautiful.



                     JONAH

                  (unaware he's talking 

                   about Annie)

              Victoria? She's okay.



     Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to 

     lose sight of Annie.



                     JONAH

              Dad, I was talking to Jessica 

              about reincarnation, and she 

              thinks that probably you knew 

              Annie in another life.



                     SAM

                  (completely distracted)

              Who is Annie?



                     JONAH

              The one who wrote us.



     Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he 

     doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because 

     he has to wait for Jonah.



                     JONAH

                  (continuing)

              But Jessica says you and Annie 

              never got together in that 

              life, and your hearts are like 

              puzzles with parts out of them 

              and when you get together the 

              puzzle's complete.



     He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.



                     SAM

              God dammit.



     A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.  

     As they walk into the distance --



                     JONAH

              The reason I know this and you 

              don't is that I'm younger and 

              purer so I'm more in touch with 

              cosmic forces.



                     SAM

              I sincerely hope you are not 

              going to marry Jessica.



     EXT. AIRPORT CAR RENTAL AGENCY - DAY



     As the shuttle bus drops Annie off at a rental car.  As 

     she gets in and starts the car.



     EXT/INT. SEATTLE/RENTAL CAR - DAY



     Annie driving through the streets of Seattle, referring 

     continually to a map she has spread out on the passenger 

     seat, trying to navigate her way to the Baldwin houseboat.



     EXT. STREET FRONTING THE BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT SLIP -- DAY



     Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the 

     Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to 

     the marina.



     ON ANNIE IN HER RENTAL CAR



     checking the map.



     Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks 

     into the rear-view mirror and sees Sam and Jonah in 

     their van, anxious for her to move so they can pull into 

     their driveway.



     Recognizing Sam from Wheedle's picture, Annie panics and 

     speeds away, tires squealing.



     EXT. SEATTLE GAS STATION - DAY



     Annie's car is parked just outside the rest room.



     INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - DAY



     Annie's in the Ladies' Room, splashing some water on her 

     face.  She towels it off and looks into the mirror.



                     ANNIE

                  (practicing)

              Hello, Mr.  Baldwin? No.  

              Hello, Sam?

                  (sweet)

              I'm Annie Reed.

                  (dignified)

              I'm Annie Reed.

                  (sultry)

              I'm Annie Reed.

                  (matter-of-fact)

              I'm Annie Reed.



     She settles on the matter-of-fact reading.



                     ANNIE

              I heard about you calling Dr. 

              Fieldstone, and well, I just 

              happened to be out here on...

              for no good reason at all...

                  (rallying, businesslike 

                   again)

              business... and I thought I'd 

              drop and...

                  (breezy)

              say hello...

                   this)

              shoot myself.



     EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - LATER



     ON ANNIE



     watching.  She's at a safe distance, across the street 

     and down some from the marina entrance.  She watches it 

     for a moment, then gains courage.  She starts to cross 

     the street to enter the dock.



     EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS



     Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.  Nervously.  Goes up 

     to the door.  Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.  No 

     response.  Let down, she's just about to walk away when 

     she hears a motor REV UP.



     Annie peeks around the side of Sam's houseboat and spots 

     Sam and Jonah heading out in their dingy.



     EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - CONTINUOUS



     Annie races back to her car, jumps in and follows the 

     boat along the seashore drive.



     EXT. SEATTLE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS



     As we see Annie driving along the water as Sam and Jonah 

     chug along in the water.



     EXT. ALKI BEACH - ON SAM AND JONAH



     They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken 

     clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.  

     They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of 

     skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.



     ON ANNIE



     checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.



                                   DISSOLVE TO:



     ANNIE'S POV - ON SAM AND JONAH - LATER



     They're throwing a football.  Jonah catches it and 

     starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and 

     feinting.  Sam tackles him and they tumble together on 

     the beach.



     CLOSE ON ANNIE



     watching.  The purity and innocence of this little scene 

     -- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more 

     than she ever could have imagined.  Their LAUGHTER 

     filters up to her.  Right to her heart.



                     ANNIE (V.O.)

              I watched him play with his son 

              at the beach.



     INT. ANNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT



     Annie's on the phone with Becky.  We cut back and forth 

     between them.



                     BECKY (V.O.)

              Did you talk to him?



                     ANNIE

              I couldn't do it.  How did I 

              get here?



     INT. BECKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Becky on the phone in bed.  And cut back and forth.



                     BECKY

              You told a lie and got on a 

              plane.



                     ANNIE

              That's not what I mean.

                  (beat)

              I'm going back over there 

              tomorrow and talk to him.  I 

              am.



                     BECKY

              Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.



                     ANNIE

              Becky?



                     BECKY

              What?



                     ANNIE

              Is this crazy?



                     BECKY

              No.  That's the weirdest part 

              about it.



                     ANNIE

              Thank you.  I love you.



                     BECKY

              I love you, too.



                     ANNIE

              Good night.



     Annie hangs up the phone.  She turns off the light.  

     Moonlight coming through the window.  Hold on her.



     EXT. STREET NEAR MARINA - DAY



     Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.



     Sam's van pulls into a parking space.  Jonah in the 

     front with Sam.  They're diagonally across a four-lane 

     street.



     ON SAM AND JONAH



     As they start to get groceries out of the car.



     Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.



     She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole 

     thing.  It's now or never.



     Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.



     Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and 

     rightness with every step.



     But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:



     SUZY



     who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at 

     the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide -- 

     beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose 

     boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah 

     are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run, 

     nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings 

     up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped 

     when he started running.



     ON ANNIE



     She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.  

     In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to 

     bear.



     ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA



     Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious 

     than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam 

     and hugs them both.



     ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.



                     SAM

              God, it's wonderful to see you.  

              Where's Greg?



                     SUZY

              He's over at the boat show.  

              He'll be by later.

                  (she looks around)

              It's so beautiful here.



     ANNIE



     There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about 

     this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the 

     middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all 

     she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.  

     She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --



     A TAXICAB



     coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.  

     Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van 

     bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps 

     back to the middle line.



     The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.



     Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.  

     The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.



     Annie screams.



     The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the 

     other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.



     ON SAM



     responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

     accident.



     ON THE CAB DRIVER



     getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the 

     sidewalk.



                     DRIVER

              Lady, what the hell are you 

              doing?



     Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster, 

     hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she 

     turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their 

     eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw 

     in the airport.



                     SAM

              Hello.



                     ANNIE

              Hello.



     Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything 

     that's happened, bolts for her car.



     Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is 

     coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets 

     into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there, 

     deflated.



     EXT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT ACROSS THE U.S. - DAY



                     ANNIE (V.O.)

              How could I have been such an 

              idiot?



     EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DUSK



     Becky's car driving toward Annie's house.



                     BECKY

              You were standing in the middle 

              of the street?



     INT. BECKY'S CAR - DUSK



                     ANNIE

              You know that dream where 

              you're walking down the street 

              naked and everyone is looking 

              at you?



                     BECKY

              I love that dream.



                     ANNIE

              That was nothing compared to 

              this humiliation, nothing.



                     BECKY

              But he saw you, right?



                     ANNIE

              He said hello.



     EXT. TOWNHOUSE - ON ANNIE & BECKY - DUSK



     As Annie leads the way to her door, from Becky's car.



                     BECKY

              And what did you say?



     Annie takes the mail from the mailbox on her way to the 

     door.



                     ANNIE

              All I could think of to say was 

              hello.



                                   CUT TO:



     "AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER" ON THE TELEVISION SET.  DEBORAH 

     KERR IS SAYING: "ALL I COULD THINK OF TO SAY WAS HELLO."



     And pull back to reveal:



     INT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT



     Becky and Annie looking at the television.



                     BECKY

              It's a sign --



                     ANNIE

              It's a sign I've watched this 

              movie too many times.

                  (beat)

              I'm so stupid.  From the minute 

              I listen to that stupid program 

              on the radio, I've been a 

              complete jerk.



     She starts absently going through the mail, throwing 

     almost all of it away without even opening it.



                     BECKY

              You don't know who she was, 

              Annie --



                     ANNIE

              I saw her.  She looked just 

              like this --



     She shows Becky the photo of Victoria and Sam having 

     dinner.



                     BECKY

              This is a photo of hair.



                     ANNIE

              Well, it's the same woman.  And 

              he was crazy about her.

                  (looking at one letter)

              What is this?

                  (beat)

              This is from Seattle.



     She opens the letter.



     Reads it.



     Looks up at Becky.



                     ANNIE

              Becky?



                     BECKY

              So I mailed your letter.



                     ANNIE

                  (reading the letter)

              "Dear Annie: Thanks for your 

              letter.  It was great.  We're 

              very excited about meeting you 

              in New York on Valentine's Day 

              and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. 

              Sleepless in Seattle."



                     BECKY

              M.F.E.O.?



                     ANNIE

              Made for each other.



     A long beat.



                     BECKY

              It's cute.  It's like a little 

              clue.



     Annie looks at her balefully.



                     BECKY

                  (continuing)

              So he can't write.  Big deal.  

              I mean, verbal ability is a 

              highly overrated thing in a 

              guy, and our pathetic need for 

              it is what gets us into so much 

              trouble.



                     ANNIE

                  (with resolve)

              I'm going to run back to 

              Walter's arms, if he's still 

              have me.



                     BECKY

              What about the letter?



                     ANNIE

              It doesn't mean anything.  It 

              was written before I went out 

              there.  Before the ho.



     She puts the letter on an ashtray, takes a match and 

     lights it.  They both watch it burn.



     CLOSEUP ON THE FIRE



     And pull back to reveal:



     INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT



     A fire is blazing in the wood-burning stove.  Suzy is 

     sitting with her husband Greg and Sam.  Jonah is in 

     evidence, curled up on the couch under some blankets, 

     asleep.  On the table near the couch is red construction 

     paper for valentines, doilies, magic markers, etc.



                     SUZY

              You saw her in the airport and 

              then here?



                     SAM

              I tried to talk to her...

                  (he shrugs)

              It was like I knew her.  Weird.



                     GREG

              Well, at least you're out there 

              seeing people again.  That's 

              terrific.



                     SAM

              Well, just one really.



                     SUZY

              How's Jonah taking it?



                     SAM

              It'll take him a while to come 

              around.  A month ago he called 

              one of those radio call-in 

              shows and told them I needed a 

              wife --



                     SUZY

                  (charmed)

              You're kidding --



                     SAM

              Now that I'm seeing someone, 

              it's a whole other thing.



     ON JONAH



     he's not asleep after all.  He's been listening all 

     along.



                     SAM

              He's become obsessed with 

              some woman who wrote me --



                     GREG

              Are you serious?



                     SAM

              She wants to meet me at the top 

              of the Empire State Building.



                     SUZY

              It's a little derivative.



                     SAM

              What do you mean?



                     SUZY

              "An Affair To Remember." Did 

              you ever see it? Cary Grant 

              and Deborah Kerr.  Before that 

              it was called "Love Affair With 

              Irene Dunne And Charles Boyer."



                     GREG

              Women love this movie.



     On Jonah, listening.



                     SUZY

              They met at the Empire State 

              Building, only they didn't.  

              Never mind.



                     GREG

              What kind of person would write 

              to someone they heard on the 

              radio?



                     SAM

              I got hundreds of letters from 

              women all over the country --



                     GREG

              Desperate women --



                     SUZY

              Just because someone's looking 

              for a nice guy doesn't make 

              them desperate.



                     GREG

              How about rapacious and love-

              starved?



                     SUZY

              No.



                     GREG

              It is easier to be killed by a 

              terrorist --



                     SUZY

              It is not --



                     GREG

              Right, right.



     Suzy's irritated.



                     SAM

              Anyway, Victoria's nice.



                     SUZY

              Would you follow her through an 

              airport?



                     SAM

              Look, I met somebody.  She's 

              good, and capable and smart.  

              We hit it off.  We can't spend 

              your life chasing after 

              fantasies.



     Jonah is devastated by the realization that his dad is 

     serious about Victoria.



     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - ON SAM IN BED - NIGHT



     The door to his bedroom opens.



     Annie walks in.  She's wearing a white men's shirt.

              Hi.



                     SAM

              Hi.

                  (a beat)

              So far so good.  So.  What 

              should we talk about? How 

              insecure we were in high 

              school.  Shirley Votypka, the 

              first girl I ever felt up.  

              Health.  What about health? 

              Did you know that eating six 

              macadamia nuts is the 

              equivalent of eating a steak?



                     ANNIE

              Shhhh --



     She unbuttons her shirt.



     And they kiss.

     windows lined with candy displays of red satin hearts, 

     lacy Valentine cards, red roses in elaborate floral

              You're going to miss the train.



                     ANNIE

              No, I'm not.

              What are your plans in New 

              York?

              We're going to the Rainbow Room 

              and the symphony tomorrow night.



                     BECKY

              I love the symphony.



                     ANNIE

                  (cheerfully)

              I hate it.

                  (she stands to go, 

                   starts toward the 

                   elevator)

              I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I 

              feel happy.  This is right.  

              This is real.  Everything else 

              is what happens when you watch 

              too many movies and completely 

              lose sight of what counts.

                  (as she steps into 

                   elevator)

              Please don't tell anyone about 

              what happened.  "Sleepless in 

              Seattle" is history.

     who's crying.



                     JESSICA

                  (weeping)

              This is the best movie I've 

              ever seen in my life.



                     JONAH

              I don't get it.



                     JESSICA

              You have to go to her, Jonah.  

              You have to find her.



     Jonah nods.  But he isn't sure how he's going to do it.



                     JONAH

              Do you know how much it costs 

              to go to New York?



                     JESSICA

              Nobody knows.  It changes 

              practically every day.  How 

              much money do you have?



                     JONAH

              Eighty dollars.



                     JESSICA

              I have forty-two.  So that 

              would definitely cover 

              taxicabs, I think.



                     JONAH

              But how am I going to get 

              there?



                     JESSICA'S MOTHER

              Honey, I'm going out for a few 

              minutes.

                  (sticking her head in 

                   the door to the living 

                   room)

              Could you keep an eye on things 

              out front till I get back?



     Jessica looks over at Jonah.



                     JESSICA

              Sure.



     INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - TRAVEL AGENCY OFFICE - DAY



     Jessica is working on the computer.  She punches Jonah's 

     name into it.



                     JESSICA

              Do you want an aisle or a 

              window seat?



                     JONAH

              Window.



                     JESSICA

              Do you want a fruit plate?



                     JONAH

              I don't know.  Do I?



                     JESSICA

                  (shrugs)

              I'd rather die than eat on an 

              airplane.

                  (beat)

              I'm telling them you're twelve 

              so you can fly unaccompanied 

              and they won't make you be 

              carried around by a stewardess 

              and everything.



     Jonah nods.



     Now Jessica takes a ticket form out of the desk and 

     starts to fill it out for Jonah.



     EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - TIFFANY'S - A SCULPTED GLASS HEART 

     - DAY



     formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in 

     pink light and spotlighted in white.



     Walter and Annie are among a few other people -- couples 

     mostly -- looking in the windows.  Each one a variation 

     on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken 

     Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out 

     of the wound in the middle.



     ON WALTER AND ANNIE'S REFLECTION



     in the Broken Heart window.



     They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start 

     to speak at once.  They stop.  Annie looks at Walter.



                     ANNIE

              You go.



                     WALTER

              Ever since Christmas, you've 

              been different.  Kind of 

              distracted, distant.  But I 

              feel like you're coming back 

              from wherever you were.



                     ANNIE

              I am.

                  (she smiles at him)

              I was just... I just got... I 

              think I got nervous.  It's 

              normal, right? Don't you ever 

              feel nervous about, you know?



                     WALTER

              What?



                     ANNIE

              About forever.



                     WALTER

              No.



                     ANNIE

              Well, I did.  And you know what 

              I think? I think that it was 

              almost... too perfect.



     INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



     As Annie and Walter walk through the jewelry department 

     to the elevator.



                     ANNIE

              I started to wonder whether we 

              were the human equivalent of 

              two rights making a wrong, you 

              know?



     Walter has no idea what she means, but he's completely 

     good-natured about it.



     INT. THIRD FLOOR TIFFANY'S - DAY



     Annie and Walter are walking around the floor, followed 

     by a SALESWOMAN who is carrying a large white card on 

     which she is noting their selections.



                     ANNIE

              It was like kismet but not, if 

              you see what I mean.



     Walter's brow furrows slightly.



                     ANNIE

                  (continuing)

              You have to grow up.  You can't 

              have all these adolescent 

              dreams about how exciting your 

              life is going to be --



     Walter starting to look puzzled.



                     ANNIE

                  (continuing)

              Don't hate me but I love this 

              pattern.



                         WALTER

              You couldn't.



                     ANNIE

              I do.



                     WALTER

              It's just like my grandmother's 

              china.



                     SALESWOMAN

              How many place settings should 

              I put down?



                     ANNIE & WALTER

              Ten.



     Walter beams at her.



                     WALTER

              Exactly.  Eight is too few and 

              twelve is too many.



     The SALESWOMAN writes a "10" on the big sheet of paper.



     INT. FIRST FLOOR - TIFFANY'S - DAY



     As Annie and Walter come out of the elevator on the 

     ground floor and WALTER stops for a moment at the 

     Jewelry Repair department, reappears with a little blue 

     Tiffany's box he gives to Annie.



     Annie opens it.



     Inside is a lovely antique diamond ring.



                     ANNIE

              Walter.



                     WALTER

              It was my mother's.



                     ANNIE

              It's so beautiful.  It's just 

              what I would have picked out if 

              I'd had every ring in the world 

              to choose from.

                  (as she slips the ring 

                   onto her finger)

              You see what I mean.  There are 

              people who would like a 

              relationship to be full of 

              surprises, but I am not one of 

              them.

                  (as she starts out the 

                   door with Walter 

                   behind, thinking about 

                   what she has just 

                   said)

              Surprises are highly overrated.



     As they go out the door to:



     EXT. FIFTH AVE.  - DAY



     As they start down the street and go off into the 

     distance.



                     ANNIE

                  (continuing)

              Promise me something, Walter.  

              Promise me you will never have 

              a surprise party for me.  Ever.  

              You know what happens, you walk 

              in the door in some horrible 

              sweater you put on that morning, 

              and there are hundreds of people 

              in their best clothes shouting 

              "Surprise!"



     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



     Sam's got a suitcase on the bed, packing.  Jonah is 

     standing in the doorway, watching.



     He goes to his desk looking for something but can't find 

     it.  He tries a few drawers.



                     SAM

              Have you seen my wallet?



                     JONAH

              It might be in the kitchen.



     Sam doesn't remember leaving it in the kitchen.



                     SAM

              I'm only going to be away one 

              night, okay, and Clarise will 

              be here.  You'll have a swell 

              time.  You'll watch a little 

              Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm 

              Street 12, I'll never know.



                     JONAH

              Are you going with her?



                     SAM

              Yes.



     Jonah walks out of Sam's bedroom and we hear the door to 

     his bedroom slam shut.



     ON SAM



     Starting to boil.



     He walks into --



     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT



     And open the door to Jonah's room.



     INT. JONAH'S ROOM - NIGHT



                     SAM

              I have to have a life.  I have 

              to do things that I want with 

              people my own age.  It's none 

              of your business who I am going 

              out with.  I don't give a good 

              goddam if you're angry --



                     JONAH

                  (holding up Annie's 

                   letter)

              This is the one I like.



     Sam starts back to his bedroom.



     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



                     SAM

              I don't care who you like.  

              It's who I like.  But the truth 

              is you're never going to like 

              anyone because it isn't your 

              mother.



     Sam throws a pair of socks into the suitcase.



                     JONAH

                  (yelling)

              Fine.  I won't say anything.  

              You can marry Count Dracula.



                     SAM

              Thank you, Jonah.  But the 

              point is, I am not asking 

              permission.



                     JONAH

                  (yelling)

              What's wrong with Annie?



                     SAM

                  (emphasizing every 

                   word)

              Shut up.



     Jonah appears at the doorway.



                     JONAH

              Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never 

              did that.  Mom never said shut 

              up to me.  Mom never yelled at 

              me.



                     SAM

              This conversation is finished.



                     JONAH

              You said we could go to New 

              York.



                     SAM

              Did not.



                     JONAH

              Did too.



                     SAM

              I can't know what I said, but 

              we're not going.



                     JONAH

                  (crossing his arms 

                   across his chest)

              I'm not leaving this room until 

              you say yes.



                     SAM

              Get out.



                     JONAH

              No.



                     SAM

              Goddammit, I am sick of this 

              --



     Sam picks Jonah up and carries him kicking and screaming 

     into:



     INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT



     and into:



     INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT



                     JONAH

              Put me down.  I hate you, I 

              hate you --



     He throws Jonah on the bed.  Jonah in tears.



                     SAM

              I'm sick of this phony 

              melodramatic bullshit.  I'm 

              sick of it.



     He leaves the room and slams the door.



     INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS



     Jonah weeping as Sam goes back to his bedroom.



     INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



     The sound of Jonah weeping.



     Sam sits down on the bed, wiped out.  Hold on him.



     EXT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



     As Clarise the babysitter arrives at the houseboat.



     INT. HOUSEBOAT - MORNING



     Sam and Clarise in the hallway outside Jonah's door.



                     SAM

              Jonah?  Clarise is here, okay? 

              And I'm leaving.



     No response.



                     SAM

              Jonah?

                  (to Clarise)

              He's probably still asleep.



     He opens the door gently to the room.



     Jonah's gone.



     IN QUICK CUTS:



     Sam looks in the bathroom: no Jonah.  In the main cabin.  

     The back deck.  Out onto the docks.  Looking all up and 

     down.  Clarise coming down the deck -- she's apparently 

     been looking in the neighborhood.  As she shakes her 

     head no, Sam goes to the bicycle shed.  Jonah's bike 

     still there.  Sam stands on the deck.



     EXT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



     We see a group of people filing off an airport shuttle 

     bus.  The sign in front rotates from "Airport" back to 

     "Marina."



     Jonah comes down the stairs and steps off with his 

     Mariners backpack.  He just stands there a beat, looking 

     around.  Then he goes through the glass doors.



     INT. AIRPORT FIRST CLASS TICKET COUNTER - DAY



     The TICKET CLERK turns back to the counter.



                     TICKET CLERK

              Next.



     Jonah steps forward, with his ticket.



     INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - DAY



     Jessica is sitting defiantly in a chair in the middle of 

     the living room.  She is being interrogated but she is 

     not going to talk.  There's a clock on the mantel.  Sam 

     is in the room with Jessica's mother and father.



                     JESSICA'S MOTHER

              Jessica, this is not 

              acceptable.



                     JESSICA'S FATHER

              If you don't tell us right now, 

              right this minute, I'm going to 

              kill you.



     Jessica rolls her eyes.



     She looks over the clock on the mantel.  As it ticks 

     to 8:30:



                     JESSICA

              He's on his way to New York.



                     JESSICA'S MOTHER

              What?



                     SAM

              How?



                     JESSICA

                  (the child of travel 

                   agents)

              United 597.



     Jessica's mother and father are horrified.



                     JESSICA'S MOTHER

              Jessica!



                     SAM

              When does it leave?



                     JESSICA'S FATHER

              Eight-thirty.



     Everyone looks over at the clock.  It says 8:31.  

     Jessica smiles.



     INT. SAM'S CAR - DAY



     CLOSE ON SAM



     Driving to the airport.



     EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY



     As his car takes the airport exit.



     INT. AIRPLANE - DAY



     A stewardess bends affectionately over Jonah, ensconced 

     in the first-class section.  He's got his backpack on 

     his lap and he's holding it.



                     STEWARDESS

              Here you go... here's a nice pin 

              for you, for flying with us.



                     JONAH

                  (completely unmoved, 

                   but polite)

              Thank you.



                     STEWARDESS

              You're welcome.  Can I take 

              that for you?



                     JONAH

                  (clutching it even 

                   tighter)

              No.



     INT. AIRPORT TICKET COUNTER - ON SAM - DAY



     at the reservations desk.  Desperation.



                     SAM

                  (frantic)

              He's about this high, 90 

              pounds, never combs his hair, 

              Mariner's hat --



                     AIRLINE CLERK

                  (to his colleagues)

              Anyone check in a 

              unaccompanied minor on the New 

              York flight?



                     FIRST CLASS TICKET CLERK

              I did.



     Sam closes his eyes.



                     SAM

              I'll kill him.

                  (beat)

              I have to get to New York as 

              fast as I can.



                     AIRLINE CLERK

              We can get you on a flight to 

              Chicago and you can change 

              planes --



     Starting to punch information into the computer.



                     AIRLINE CLERK

              How will you be paying for 

              this?



                     SAM

                  (taking out his wallet)

              American Express.

                  (there's no American 

                   Express card in his 

                   wallet)

              Visa.

                  (beat)

              I really am going to kill him.



     INT. O'HARA AIRPORT - DAY



     As Sam comes out of the plane from Seattle and dashes 

     through the concourse, managing to arrive at the plane 

     for New York at the very last moment.



     INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY



     As Jonah comes out of the plane from Seattle and looks 

     up to see which way to go.  He looks very small.  Big 

     New York passengers in a hurry whiz by with their 

     carryons dangerously flying at their sides.



     EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - A FEW MINUTES LATER



     Jonah stands in a taxi line.



     INT. TAXI - A FEW MINUTES LATER



     Jonah sits down in the back seat.  Looks up.  A big 

     bruiser of a CAB DRIVER leans back over the seat, sizing 

     Jonah up.



                     TAXI DRIVER

              Where to?



                     JONAH

              Empire State Building.



     INT. PLANE TO NEW YORK - DAY



     Sam is in an aisle seat.  He closes his eyes and 

     squeezes them tight.



                     SAM

                  (to himself)

              Come on... come on... come on... 

              COMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEONCOMEON...



     EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - AFTERNOON



     It looks magnificent in the waning afternoon light.



                     CABBIE'S VOICE

              There it is.



     We are watching from:



     INT. A TAXICAB



     where Jonah, with his head out the window, regards the 

     building with awe.



                     CABBIE

              What are you gonna do there, 

              spit off the top?



                     JONAH

              No.  I'm gonna meet...

                  (trying to figure out 

                   what to call her)

              my mother.



     INT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



     Walter and Annie walking toward their table with the 

     MAITRE D'.



     Annie sits down, looks at the view.  Walter starts to 

     sit, revealing a spectacular view of the EMPIRE STATE 

     BUILDING directly behind him.  Annie's smile fades.



                     WALTER

              Is something wrong.



     Annie shakes her head.



                     MAITRE D'

              May I get you a drink?



                     WALTER

              Some champagne?



                     ANNIE

              Fine, fine.



     Walter glances back over his shoulder.



                     WALTER

              Beautiful view, isn't it?



                     ANNIE

              Walter, there's something I 

              have to tell you --



     EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DUSK



     As Sam rushes out of the terminal.  Desperate.



     A cab pulls up.  Sam bolts to the head of the line and 

     muscles his way into the cab.  The other people in line 

     are irate.



                     SAM

              Sorry, this is an emergency.



     The cab pulls out to a chorus of verbal abuse.



                     SAM (V.O.)

              Empire State Building.



     INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING LOBBY - DUSK



     Jonah, carrying his backpack, walks through the majestic 

     lobby and follows the arrow to the Observation Deck.



     EXT. TOP OF EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - HELICOPTER SHOT - DESK



     Looking down on the observation deck.  The city below.  

     The tiny figure of Jonah walks into the middle of the 

     deck.  Looks around.



     EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DUSK



     Sam's cab speeds across the bridge and into Manhattan, 

     heading for the Empire State Building.



     INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - DUSK



     Jonah is going to take the bull by the horns.  He walks 

     up to a likely-looking WOMAN.



                     JONAH

              Hi, I'm Jonah.  Are you Annie?



                     WOMAN #1

              No.

                  (smiles at him)

              I'm Cynthia.



     He spies another unattached woman.



                     JONAH

              Excuse me, are you Annie?



     EXT. RAINBOW ROOM - DUSK



     A helicopter shot of Annie talking animatedly to Walter.



     And pull back to reveal that the Rainbow Room is 

     actually being seen by Jonah through a viewscope in:



     EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - DUSK INTO 

     NIGHT



     Jonah is looking through the viewfinder.  He turns 

     around, forlorn.  He takes off his backpack and is about 

     to sit down next to it when Sam bolts into the 

     observation deck.



     Jonah leaps into his arms.



                     SAM

              You're my family.  You're all 

              I've got.  What if something 

              happened to you?



     Sam's eyes well up.  Jonah starts to cry.



                     SAM

              What if I couldn't get to you?



                     JONAH

              I was scared of what you were 

              gonna do.



                     SAM

              When I found you?



                     JONAH

              If I didn't go.



                     SAM

              Listen, have I ever done 

              anything really stupid?



                     JONAH

              No.



                     SAM

              I mean, so far, have I screwed 

              it up for you?



                     JONAH

              No.



     The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:



                     SAM

              I can't believe you flew first 

              class.



                     JONAH

              It was all they had.



     INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT



     Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses, 

     but neither of them has drunk a drop.



                     ANNIE

              I don't know what to say about 

              it, Walter.  It was a form of 

              temporary insanity.  But I had 

              to tell you about it because --



                     WALTER

                  (matter-of-fact)

              -- it was a betrayal.



                     ANNIE

              Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It 

              was just...



                     WALTER

              So what happened?



                     ANNIE

              I told you.  Nothing --



                     WALTER

              At the top of the Empire State 

              Building --



                     ANNIE

              I'm not at the top of the 

              Empire State Building.  I'm 

              here.



                     WALTER

              Not really.

                  (beat)

              Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's 

              leave that out of it.  I don't 

              want to be someone you're 

              settling for.  I don't want to 

              be someone anyone settles for.

                     (beat)

              I have a life insurance policy,  

              I'm fully invested in growth 

              stocks, I have a paid 

              subscription to Home Rox 

              Office, I have no sexual 

              diseases, I have been steadily 

              employed in a part of the 

              economy that isn't soft, I have 

              expectation in the way of 

              inherited wealth, I dress 

              nicely, I am a member of the 

              private sector, an independent 

              voter, I don't watch Monday 

              Night Football, the only thing 

              wrong with me is that I am 

              allergic to wheat, 

              strawberries, penicillin, 

              pollen, nuts and wool.  There 

              are plenty of women who see me 

              as the brass ring.  If you 

              don't -- marriage is hard 

              enough without bringing such 

              low expectations into it, isn't 

              it?



     Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.



                     ANNIE

              Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve 

              you.



                     WALTER

              I think that's what I'm saying.



     Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off 

     her finger and hands it to Walter.



     No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle 

     with each other.



                     ANNIE

              You okay?



                     WALTER

              Yes.

                  (beat)

              Some people will do anything to 

              get out of going to a symphony.



     This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.



                     ANNIE

              Oh!



                     WALTER

              What?



                     ANNIE

              Look!



     Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie 

     sees:



     THE LIGHTS HAVE JUST GONE ON ON THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING 

     VALENTINE LIGHTS:



     A huge pink and white heart.



     Walter turns back to Annie.



                     WALTER

              Go for it.



     And as Annie's heart leaps and she's about to bolt.



                                   CUT TO:



     EXT. WEST 50TH STREET - NIGHT



     As Annie comes out to the street and hails a cab.



     As it screeches off toward Fifth Ave.



     INT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT



     The lights are on all over the city.



     The crowd has thinned out considerably.  Jonah and Sam 

     are among the last people left.  They gaze out at the 

     twinkling lights and the ever-darkening sky.



                     ELEVATOR OPERATOR

              Last call.  Closing time.



     Jonah looks at Sam.



                     JONAH

              This is pretty dumb, wasn't 

              it?



     Sam shrugs.



                     SAM

              Big deal.



     After a beat.



                     SAM

              Maybe we'll get a dog when we 

              get back.



                     JONAH

              Okay.



                     SAM

              What do you mean, okay? 

              Wouldn't you like a dog?



                     JONAH

              Sure.



     Sam puts his arm around him, they start toward the 

     elevator.



                     SAM

              Let's go home.



     EXT. FIFTH AVE - NIGHT



     Annie's cab stuck in traffic.



     As Annie gets out of the cab.



     She's breaking into a hard run toward the Empire State 

     Building.



     INT. LOBBY OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



     Annie sprints in and over to Information Booth.



                     INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

              Sorry, ma'am, but the elevators 

              are closed.



                     ANNIE

                  (out of breath)

              No.  Please.  I really need to 

              get up there.



                     INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

              We're closing up.  No more runs 

              tonight.



     Annie takes a deep breath.  She's hit the end of the 

     road.  She turns to go but then turns back.



                     ANNIE

                  (out of breath)

              Listen, can I just take a look? 

              Maybe... maybe... There's 

              someone I was supposed to 

              meet... He's probably not 

              there, but if I don't at least 

              look I'll always wonder about 

              it.



     The Information Booth Person looks at her.



                     INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

              Cary Grant, right?



                     ANNIE

              You know that movie?



                     INFORMATION BOOTH PERSON

              One of my wife's favorites.



     INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING



     After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very 

     empty platform.



                     ELEVATOR MAN

              Sorry, ma'am.  Empty.



     Annie slowly walks out.



                     ANNIE

              Can I take a minute?



                     ELEVATOR MAN

              Go ahead.



     She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the 

     twinkling lights below.



     She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees 

     something on the floor.



     Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.



     She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be... 

     could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and 

     Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other 

     elevator DINGS.



     Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.



                     JONAH

              I left it near the...



     And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam 

     can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.



                     SAM

              It's you.



                     ANNIE

              It's me?



                     SAM

              The one in the street.  I 

              chased after you.



                     JONAH

              Are you Annie?



                     ANNIE

              Yes.



                     SAM

                  (confused)

         You're Annie too?



     She smiles awkwardly.



                     ANNIE

                  (indicating the 

                   backpack)

              Is this yours?



     Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She 

     shakes it solemnly.



                     JONAH

              I'm Jonah.

                  (nodding back to Sam)

              That's my dad.  His name is 

              Sam.



                     ANNIE

              Hi, Jonah.  Sam.

                  (indicating the teddy 

                   bear)

              And who is this?



                     JONAH

              Howard.



                     ANNIE

              Howard.



     Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.  

     Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do 

     next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS 

     HIS THROAT.



                     SAM

              We better go.



     Annie nods.



     Sam holds out his hand.



                     SAM

              Shall we?



     Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable, 

     natural, right.



                     ANNIE

              Sam?



     He looks at her.



                     ANNIE

              It's nice to meet you.



     On Annie.



     On Sam.



     On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist 

     gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.



     EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT



     WE SEE THE BUILDING from above, all lit up, a romantic 

     confection, the world's largest Valentine.



     The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see the United States 

     spread out before us, with lights twinkling everywhere.



     And





     FADE OUT
