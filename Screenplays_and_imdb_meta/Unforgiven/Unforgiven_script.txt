INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 1

NIGHT IN ALICE'S ROOM.  A little bit of moonlight coming in
through the tiny window might make a highlight here and
there but that's about all.  Words begin to crawl across the
screen:

             WRITTEN WORDS (crawl)
     Of good family, albeit one of
     modest means, she was a comely
     young woman and not without
     prospects.  Therefore it was at
     once heartbreaking and astonishing
     to her mother that she would enter
     into marriage with William Munny, a
     known thief and murderer, a man of
     notoriously vicious and intemperate
     disposition.

We can HEAR STRAWBERRY ALICE and DAVEY BUNTING breathing
heavily and the bed creaking.

             WRITTEN WORDS (crawl)
     They were married in St. Louis in
     1870 and they traveled North to
     Kansas where he engaged in farming
     and swine husbandry.

Davey and Alice are picking up speed now, breathing faster
and even snorting a little, and it's cold as Jesus in
Nebraska in the winter so when the blanket slips, Alice
snarls and gasps.

              ALICE
     The blanket, for chrissake,
     cowboy, the blanket.

There are six of these little rooms... one for each whore...
behind Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards and the walls are
just boards so you can hear what's happening in the other
rooms and right now, from DELILAH'S room, you can hear a
high-pitched, merry little giggle and that's important.

          WRITTEN WORDS (crawl contd.)
     She bore him two children in the
     eight years of their marriage and
     when she died, it was not at his
     hands as her mother might have
     expected, but of smallpox.  That
     was in 1878.

          DELILAH'S VOICE o.s.
     No, please.... No, no goddamn you.

Alice and Davey have stopped fucking and started listening
but they don't move.

          WRITTEN WORDS
          (Crawl cont'd)
     It wasn't until 1881... three
     yeats later... that a cowboy named
     Mike cut up a whore in Big
     Whiskey, Nebraska in the Niobrara
     River country.
           (end crawl)

           MIKE'S VOICE o.s.
     Davey, come a runnin' lad an'
     hold the thieving cunt...

A blur of action as Davey leaps from the bed and dashes out
of the room naked...

           MIKE'S VOICE o.s.
     ...brand you like a damn steer,
     bitch...

and Alice is right behind him, wrapping herself in a blanket
as she goes.


INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - NIGHT 2

DELILAH is backed up against the wall, her face bleeding,
and she is throwing the contents of her chamber pot on MIKE
who is advancing on her with an open barlow knife and Davey
busts into the room naked and Alice follows him and people
are shouting in other rooms.

              MIKE
           (wiping shit off himself)
     Hold the bitch, Davey, hold her.

The one coal oil lamp in the room gives off just enough
light that you can make all this out.  Certainly you can see
that Mike, who is wearing leggings and no shirt, is a big
tough man, unshaven, eyes inflamed with whiskey...

              MIKE
     HOLD HER, DAMMIT, DAVEY!
     If you don't hold her I'll
     cut her tits off.

LITTLE SUE, a fifteen year old whore, is in the doorway,
eyes wide with terror and Alice screams at her.

              ALICE
     Get Skinny, for God's sake!
     SKINNY!

Davey is reluctant about the whole thing but he is afraid of
Mike and he gets behind Delilah and grabs her.

              DAVEY
     Wh-what you gonna do, Mike?

Mike is doing it now and Delilah is screaming while he
carves her face with the barlow knife and blood is all over,
splashing on Davey and Davey, who is just a kid, after all,
nineteen with a big shock of unruly red hair and innocent
blue eyes, is horrified.

              MIKE
     Thieving cunt, I'll...

              DAVEY
     Mike, don't, Jesus, don't...

              ALICE
     SKINNY!  Bring your gun.

Alice can't wait for Skinny and she jumps on Mike's back and
brings the big man down and she fights him though she's not
a big woman.   Alice is twenty-five but she's been around
some, whored some tough cow-towns, and she has too much bone
and character in her face to be outright pretty but she
attracts men like flies.  Sure she has some smallpox scars
on her face, but they're common and there are only a few of
them, not like on Skinny whose mean little face is eaten
right up with them.

VIEW ON SKINNY DUBOIS

STANDING THERE IN THE DOORWAY, his nasty face eaten with
smallpox scars and he is looking at Delilah who is a
fountain of blood, looking at her coldly, and looking down
at the melee on the floor and, pointing the big Navy Colt in
his hand, he says,

             SKINNY
     Get offa her, asshole.

And he says it so cold and with such authority that
everything goes quiet.


EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 3

SNOW/MOONLIGHT/THE SHADOWY BUILDINGS and the silence of the
Nebraska winter except for the sound of the snowshoes.

The snow has obliterated the Main Street of Big Whiskey
giving the impression that the dark, low buildings are
scattered at random.  The only structure with any sign of
life is Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards which shows a
glowing window and two horses out front and that is a
hundred yards away from the struggling silhouettes of the
two men on snowshoes.  The big one is LITTLE BILL DAGGETT
and he is very big, wrapped in a huge bearskin robe.

The smaller one is CLYDE LEDBETTER who isn't small though he
has only one arm.

           LITTLE BILL
     ...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?

              CLYDE
     Hell, you know how Skinny is.  Says
     he's gonna shoot 'em...
     ...an I says, "Skinny, you can't
     do that," an' he says, "Well, then
     get Little Bill down here an' let's
     settle this" an' I says, "Bill's
     sleepin', Skinny," an'...

They make their way in silence through the snow, getting
close now, close to Greely's and the lights.


INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - NIGHT 4

DELILAH ON HER BED, her face covered with blood-soaked rags
except for her eyes.  Alice has hot water and is ministering
to her and Little Bill is looking down at her from his
enormous height, still in his bearskin.  He looks disgusted.

           LITTLE BILL
     She ain't gonna die, huh?

You can now see fear in Delilah's eyes, and the other whores
...CROW CREEK KATE with crazy pop-eyes and frizzy hair, and
LITTLE SUE who is fifteen and meek even when she isn't
terrified, and FAITH who is the oldest of them and not very
attractive and SILKY who is blonde and the prettiest... are
watching from vantage points in the doorway or in the room.

              ALICE
           (determined)
     She's gonna live.
           (Little Bill turns to go)
     She didn't steal nothin',
     She didn't touch his poke.

           LITTLE BILL
             (stopping and turning)
     No?

              ALICE
     All she done was... when she
     seen he had a teensy little
     pecker... she gave a giggle.
     That's all.  She didn't know
     no better.

Little Bill turns away, disgusted, and starts out of the
room and Alice gets up and follows him.

              ALICE
     You gonna hang 'em, Little Bill?


INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT 5

Davey sitting naked on the floor of the bar room and Mike is
sitting near him, still in his leggings and both men are
shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbellied
stove where Clyde is standing watching them.

It is a big room, with a crude bar and four tables and some
moose and elk heads on the wall.  The door near the rear
where it says "Billiard Room" leads not to a Billiard Room
but to the six little "rooms" that are the whorehouse and
and now you can hear Delilah groaning from there.

And Little Bill enters from the back of the bar room,
stooping to pass through the doorway under the sign that
says "Billiard Room."

Little Bill is huge and ominous.  Some say he acquired the
bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he
drowned the animal in spit.  Anyhow, he's big with a
drooping moustache and he is sucking on his church warden's
clay pipe and you know he isn't scared of anything.

And the two cowboys are scared to death, not just shivering
from the cold, and Bill just looks down at them and sucks on
his pipe and Alice comes in from the back way too and then
Skinny and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway.

           LITTLE BILL
     Clyde, step across to the German's
     an' fetch up one of his bullwhips.

Stark terror on the faces of Davey and Mike as Clyde exits.

              ALICE
     A whippin'?  That's all they get?
     After what they done?

           LITTLE BILL
             (sucking on his pipe)
     Whippin' ain't a little thing,
     Alice.

              ALICE
     But what they done, they...

             SKINNY
           (he has a piece of paper
          in his hand)
     Shut up, Alice.  Little Bill,
     a whippin' ain't gonna settle
     this.

           LITTLE BILL
     No?

             SKINNY
          (showing the paper)
     This here's a lawful contract...
     betwixt me an' Delilah
     Fitzgerald, the cut-whore.  Now I
     brung her clear from Boston, paid
     her expenses an' all, an' I got a
     contract which represents an
     investment of capital.

           LITTLE BILL
          (sympathetic to the
            argument)
     Property.

             SKINNY
     Damaged property.  Like if I
     was to hamstring one of their
     cow ponies.

           LITTLE BILL
     You figure nobody'll want to
     fuck her.

             SKINNY
     Hell no.  Leastways, they won't
     pay to do it.

Alice is listening to this and her eyes are like coals and
you can hear Delilah moaning in the other room.

          SKINNY (cont'd)
     She could maybe clean up around
     the place or somethin', but
     nobody's gonna pay good money
     for a cut-up whore.

           LITTLE BILL
            (making up his mind and
          turning to the
           shivering cowboys)
     You boys are off of the Spade
     Outfit.  Got your own string
     of ponies?

              DAVEY
            (nodding)
     I... I got f-f-f-four.

           LITTLE BILL
     You?

              MIKE
           (sullenly)
     Six.

Skinny nods, pleased, and Alice watches, her eyes still hot.

           LITTLE BILL
     Guess you boys just as soon not
     have no trial an' fuss, huh?

Davey and Mike nod, willing to say anything Little Bill
wants.

          LITTLE BILL cont'd
           (to Mike)
     Alright.  You done the cuttin'...
     Come the thaw, you bring in five
     of them ponies an' give 'em over
     to Skinny here.

              MIKE
     Five!

           LITTLE BILL
            (to Davey)
     An' you... you give over two
     ponies, hear? -

Clyde bangs in out of the snow with a buggy whip in his
hand.

              CLYDE
     I couldn't find no bullwhips,
     Bill.  The German...

           LITTLE BILL
     Don't matter, we don't need no
     whips.
          (to Mike and Davey)
     Spring comes an' Skinny don't
     have them ponies, I'm gonna...

              ALICE
     You... you ain't even gonna...
     whip 'em?

           LITTLE BILL
     I fined 'em instead.

              ALICE
     For what they done?  Skinny gets
     some ponies an' that's... ?

           LITTLE BILL
           (approaching her)
     Ain't you seen enough blood for
     one night?  Hell, Alice, they
     ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad
     men.  They're hard workin' boys
     that was foolish.  Why if they was
     given over to wickedness in a
     regular way...

              ALICE
            (furious)
     Like whores?

             SKINNY
     Alice, tend to Delilah.

For a long moment Alice just stands there glaring.


INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - DAY 6

DAYLIGHT AND A BASIN OF BLOODY WATER and Little Sue is just
dipping another towel in the hot water next to Delilah's
bed, changing the bandages.   All the whores are there in
various states of dress, lounging on the floor, leaning
against the wall.

              SILKY
            (to Alice)
     If Delilah don't care one way or
     the other, what're you so riled
     about?

              ALICE
          (passionately)
     Just because them smelly assholes
     like to ride us like horses don't
     mean we got to let 'em brand us
     like we're horses.  Maybe we ain't
     nothin' but whores, but by God we
     ain't horses.

Silky is thinking it over, frowning, and then she makes her
decision.

              SILKY
            (to Alice)
     I got a hundred an' twelve dollars.
     That's everythin'.

              ALICE
     What about you, Faith?

              FAITH
          (reluctantly)
     Two hundred...
           (there are gasps)
     Two hundred an' forty.

              ALICE
            (laughing)
     Jesus, Faith, what you been doin',
     givin' Skinny somethin' special?

All the women laugh and Delilah through her bandages makes a
gurgling sound and Little Sue's eyes light up.

            LITTLE SUE
          (indicating Delilah)
     She laughed.

              ALICE
     With what Kate got, Silky got some,
     an' mine, an' Little S...

              SILKY
            (soberly)
     It ain't enough.

              ALICE
           (determined)
     Not yet maybe.


EXT. HOG PEN - DAY 7

The hog in the mud, snorting and squealing, ugly as hell and
BILL MUNNY in the mud with him, pushing and shoving, trying
to move the stubborn animal and Munny goes down face first
and comes up more covered with mud than he already was and
the words on the screen say,

             WRITTEN WORDS (super)
     Some months later, Hodgeman
     County, Kansas.

Munny is thirty-five or forty years old, his hair is
thinning and his moustache droops glumly over his stubbled
jaw.  If it were not for his eyes he would look like any pig
farmer with his canvas overalls tucked in his boots pushing
on a hog.  He is pushing on the hog again, grunting with the
effort, when he hears the voice.

          THE KID'S VOICE o.s.
             You don't look like no rootin',
             tootin', sonofabitchin',
             cold-blooded assassin.

              MUNNY
            (looking up, startled)
             Huh?

THE KID is only six feet away, the sun behind him, sitting
on a very big and very ancient Morgan horse.  He's wearing
a wide-brimmed Texas hat, a vest, a holstered pistol, and he
is a wiry kid, maybe twenty years old, with scraggly blonde
hair, four of his upper front teeth missing, and a funny,
squinty way of looking out of his watery blue eyes.  Most of
all, he doesn't look very prosperous.

             THE KID
     I seen how you got only three
     fingers on your left hand, though,
     so I guess you're calling yourself
     Mister Bill Munny.

Munny does indeed have three fingers on his left hand and he
doesn't like this conversation at all.

              MUNNY
     William Munny, yeah.


             THE KID
     Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in
     Lake County?

             A VOICE
     Paw!  Hey, Paw!

The voice belongs to WILL,  a skinny ten-year-old who dashes
up with his seven-year-old sister, PENNY, right on his
heels.  The kids are ragged and dirty, they don't look well
fed or even very healthy.  Even as Will speaks to his
father, Munny, his eyes, and Penny's too, go to The Kid.
They don't see many strangers.

              MUNNY
     What is it, son?

              WILL
     Two more hogs got the fever.

Munny winces.  The Kid ignores the interruption.

             THE KID
     You shot Charlie Pepper, didn't
     you?  And you're the one killed
     William Harbey an' robbed the
     train over...

              MUNNY
            (sharply)
     Hold on, mister.
            (to Will)
     Son, this here pig gotta be moved
     outta this pen, away from them
     others.  Penny, you give yer
     brother a hand...

              PENNY
           (emotional)
     This one's sick too?

Munny ignores the question, already on his way to the
miserable-looking shack.

              MUNNY
     Let's talk inside, mister.


INT. SOD HUT - DAY 8

Munny selects a tin cup from a wash pan of dirty dishes.  It
is dark and cool inside his one room sod hut... and poor.

The Kid checks one of the three chairs for stability before
sitting down.

              MUNNY
     You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh?
     Hell, I thought maybe you was
     someone come to kill me...
             (he has the cups and
            he crosses to the fire)
     ...for somethin' I done in the
     old days.

             THE KID
            (sitting)
     I could of... easy.

              MUNNY
     Yeah, I guess so.

             THE KID
     Like I was sayin' you don't look
     like no meaner than hell cold-
     blooded damn killer.

              MUNNY
     Maybe I ain't.

             THE KID
     Well, Uncle Pete said you was the
     goddamndest meanest sonofabitch
     ever lived an' if I ever wanted a
     partner for a killin', you was the
     worst one.  Meanin' the best.  On
     account of you're cold as snow an'
     don't have no weak nerve nor fear.

Munny serves the coffee gloomily and sits down.  It appears
his feelings are hurt but The Kid doesn't notices.

              MUNNY
     He said that, huh?

             THE KID
     I'm a damn killer myself, only I
     ain't killed so many as you because
     of my youth.  Schofield Kid, they
     call me.

              MUNNY
     Schofield?  You from Schofield?

             THE KID
          (laying his Smith & Wesson
          Schofield .45 on the table)
     On account of my Schofield model
     Smith and Wesson pistol.

              MUNNY
     Oh.

             THE KID
     Well, how about it?

              MUNNY
     About what?

             THE KID
     Bein' my partner.   I'm headin' North
     up around the Niobrara in Nebraska.
     Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.

              MUNNY
     What for?

             THE KID
     For cuttin' up a lady.   They cut up
     her face an' cut her eyes out, cut
     her ears off an' her tits too.

              MUNNY
           (horrified)
     Jesus!

             THE KID
           (pleased with the
            reaction)
     Thousand dollars of reward.  Five
     hundred a piece.

              WILL
     Paw, I can't move that damn pig.

Will has slipped into the house with Penny in tow and they
are both covered with mud and Will is swearing toshow off
to the stranger.

              MUNNY
          (embarrassed)
     No cussin' now, Will.   Go on out
     the pump an' clean up some an' I'll
     be along.   Check them other pens.

The two kids back out the door, eyes on the pistol and the
stranger, and Munny walks over near the beds with his back
to The Kid.

              MUNNY
     I ain't like that no more, Kid.
     Whiskey done it as much as anythin'
     I guess.
          (turning to The Kid)
     I ain't touched a drop in ten years.
     My wife, she cured me of it...
     cured me of drink an' wickedness.

             THE KID
     Well... you don't look so prosper-
     ous.  Hell, you could buy her a new
     dress out of your half.  We could
     kill them two an' you could buy
     your wife one of them fancy...

              MUNNY
     She's passed on, Kid.

             THE KID
     Huh?

              MUNNY
     Been gone near three years now.

             THE KID
          (staring stupidly)
     Oh.


EXT. SOD HUT - DAY 9

Will and Penny in front of the house, looking up at The Kid
who is mounted again and Munny is standing there taking
leave of The Kid.

             THE KID
     Don't tell nobody about the
     reward an' all.  Don't need no
     other gunmen tryin' to collect.

              MUNNY
     I don't never see nobody anyhow.

             THE KID
          (riding away)
     If you was to change your mind,
     might be you could catch me...
     due West to the Western Trail
     an' North to Ogallala.

Munny waves at The Kid and for a long moment watches him
trot across the flat, grassy fields.  Then he turns back to
his shabby farm and the squealing pigs and the two children
who are looking up at him.

              WILL
     Who's he?

              MUNNY
          (turning away)
     Best we move that pig.


EXT. HOG PEN - DAY 10

Munny in the mud and the pig squealing and Will is there
pushing too and Munny goes in face first again and when he
comes up he slowly wipes mud from his face and, turning, he
looks across the fields.

VIEW ON PENNY

Coming up beside the pen.

              PENNY
     Paw... two of them others
     ...I think they got the fever.

Munny frowns and looks off at the horizon, lost in thought.

VIEW ON THE KID

Way off in the distance, disappearing on the horizon.


EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL - DAY 11

EXTREME CLOSE UP ON DELILAH

Delilah's face!  The cut-whore.  Skeins of criss-crossing
raised flesh, a vicious web of scars dominated by her eyes
that are deep and beautiful.

She's hanging clothes on a clothes line on Big Whiskey Hill,
the gentle slope above the town.  Alice, Little Sue, Silky,
Kate, and Faith are close by, hanging clothes or washing
them in the gurgling stream.

Faith is the first to glance down the hill toward the town
and to notice.  She draws in her breath and turns to Alice
and catches her eye and Alice looks down.


EXT. MUDDY NORTH ROAD 12

The muddy North Road and the two riders, and they are Quick
Mike and Davey Bunting leading their ponies in, passing a
crudely painted sign that says:

     "Ordinance 14.  No firearms in
     Big Whiskey.  Deposit them at
     County Office.
             By Order of Sheriff."


EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL - DAY 13

The whores on the hill.  One by one, with no words
exchanged, they feel the silence and turn and exchange
glances and they glance at Delilah.  She winces and turns
back to hanging clothes.

VIEW ON A HORSE'S OPEN MOUTH AND SKINNY

Inspecting.

             SKINNY
     You boys took a while.  Couple
     more days I was gonna call on
     the Sheriff.

The horses are gathered in front of Greely's and Skinny
moves among them inspecting them while the two cowboys
remain mounted.

              DAVEY
     River was swole so we couldn't
     cross her.

Davey is holding the halter of a little paint and when SKINNY
starts to inspect the pain, Davey pulls the pony away.

              DAVEY
     You got two of mine.  This here
     one ain't yours.

Skinny and Davey lock eyes and Skinny is wondering how far
to push it when SPLAT!... Davey gets a face full of mud.
The three men turn to see the whores coming around the side
of Greely's, all except Delilah, and they are throwing mud,
scooping it from the sloppy street and...

MIKE gets a hit on the chest and then on the face and he
gives an ugly look and wheels his horse and digs in his
spurs and heads North at a trot and mud continues to rain on
him as the whores jeer.

             SKINNY
     Damn you.
            (SPLAT)
     That ain't no way to behave.
            (SPLAT)
     Quit that.

Surprisingly, Davey turns his horse right into the barrage
of mud and taking it in the face and on the chest he
dismounts.  His paint takes a big gob of mud on one eye and
Davey wipes the mud off tenderly.

              DAVEY
     This here pony... I brung it for
     the lady... the one my partner
     cut.

The whores stop throwing mud abruptly.  There is a pause...
and they can see that he is just a kid, and that he is sorry
as hell and that he is about to cry and they are touched,
especially Little Sue.

              DAVEY
     It's the best of the lot... better
     than the ones I give him.
          (indicating Skinny)
     She could sell it or... what she
     wants.

              ALICE
           (recovering)
     A pony!...  She ain't got no face
     left an' you're gonna give her a
     goddamn mangy pony.

              DAVEY
     He ain't m-m-mangy, ma'am, he...

SLOP.  Davey gets it in the face with a big gob of mud as
Alice resumes fire and SPLAT, the paint gets it.

Faith and Silky and Kate hesitate just a moment... and then
they dig in and start jeering and throwing again and Little
Sue bends down slowly and picks up some mud and then she
just stands there with it, almost crying, and watches the
cowboy turn away under a barrage of mud and mount his pony
and ride out, mud hitting him all over and the women jeering
and running after him in the muddy street.

VIEW ON DELILAH

Hanging clothes up on the hill and she canhear the shouting
in the distance and she turns and looks down with the
beautiful eyes and sees the cowboy riding out of town
slowly, chased by the jeering women.


INT. SOD HUT - DAY 14

CLOSE on a photograph of CLAUDIA in Munny's hands.  He is
inside, kneeling on the floor beside an open truck and he is
studying reverently the old photo of Claudia, smiling
radiantly in her best dress.  Finally Munny puts the picture
down and digs in the trunk among folded dresses that
belonged to her until he feels something metal and he sees
the blue steel among the white cloth and then he pulls it
out... an old Starr .44 Pistol.


EXT. SOD HUT - DAY 15

CLOSE on a Mojav coffee tin as Munny places it on the fence
behind his sod hut.  Munny has the Starr in his right hand
and he turns and walks back toward the house 15 yards away.

Will and Penny are watching.   They know something is going
on, but they don't know how to ask what it is.

Munny faces the coffee tin and solemnly extends his pistol
arm straight out and carefuly sights along the barrel.

BAM!  A burst of flame and a puff of black smoke from the
gun.

The Mojav tin hasn't moved.

Slowly, carefully, Munny raises the gun again and aims with
great deliberation.

BAM!  The coffee tin doesn't move.

Munny shakes his head slowly in disgust and aims again.

BAM!  Missed again.

Munny gives a quick sheepish glance in the direction of the
children.  There is a lot of smoke.  He aims again and

BAM!  He misses.

Munny is irritated and he aims and fires hastily and flame
bursts from the gun and smoke and

The tin is unmoved.

Will looks at his feet, embarrassed, not wanting to meet his
father's eyes.

Munny stuffs the pistol in his waistband and disappears into
the house.

Will and Penny look at one another nervously, wondering
what's happening.

              PENNY
          Did Paw used to kill folks?

Will doesn't answer and then he looks up because Munny steps
out of the house again, a sawed off Remington 10 gauge
shotgun in his hands.

Munny raises the double barreled weapon to his shoulder and
aims carefully and...

BARRRROOOOOM!  The can flies away in pieces and some of the
fence, too.


EXT. SHADE TREES - DAY 16

A HEADSTONE.  It says:

          "CLAUDIA FEATHERS MUNNY
          Born, March 11, 1849
          Died, August 6, 1878,
          aged 29 years, in the
          full enjoyment of that
          love which constrained
          her to leave all for
          Christ and heathen souls

          Lo, we have left all and followed thee:
          What shall we leave therefore.
                       19:25"

The headstone is under a couple of shade trees fifty yards
from the sod hut.  MUNNY is sitting on a rock under the
trees looking at the headstone and he has on a cheap black
suit now.  He twists the hat, tormented... and he starts to
say something out loud but he can't because men don't talk
to stones.  So finally he gets up, slumped in defeat, and he
puts a little bouquet of flowers on the grave and he turns
away unhappily.


EXT. SOD HUT - DAY 17

The ALBINO MARE snorting and shying, anxious to lose the
saddle.  Will has her by the halter, holding her with
effort, in front of the house.

              WILL
     She ain't hardly a saddle horse no
     more, Paw.  She ain't used to the
     feel.

Munny walks up and puts his hand on Penny's head fondly.

              MUNNY
     Them flowers, Penny, I could
     tell your Maw liked them, hear?
           (turning to Will)
     Take care of your sister, son.
     You can kill three chickens if
     you need, not no more.  Keep
     the hogs that got fever
     separate if you can.  An' if
     you need help, go see Sally Two-
     Trees over to Ned Logan's.

Then he turns to the mare and shoves a foot in the stirrup
to mount but the horse shies and Munny goes down in the dust
looking very undignified.

And Penny is horrified and humiliated for her father whom
she worships and Will's eyes are big because Munny's coat
came open and he caught a quick glimpse of the Starr pistol
stuck in the waist band.

              MUNNY
            (brushing himself off,
           embarrassed)
     Ain't felt a saddle in a while
     myself.

Then Munny has one foot in the stirrup and the horse starts
to shy and Munny has to hop around with one foot stirruped
and the other not... and when he tries to swing aboard he
falls back...

              MUNNY
     Easy old gal, easy...

And he still can't make it, so to cover his embarrassment he
talks to the kids while he hops around desperately trying to
mount.

              MUNNY
     Now this here horse is gettin'
     even on me... hold on gal... for
     the sins of my youth... In my
     youth... before I met... your
     dear departed mother... I was
     weak an' givin' to mistreatin'
     horses an' such.  An' this here
     horse... an' that ole pig, too,
     I guess... is my comeuppance for
     my cruelty...

At last he is in the saddle and takes a deep breath.

              MUNNY
     Used to be I could cuss an' hurt
     an animal... til your departed
     mother, God rest her, showed me the
     error of my ways.

Munny turns the Albino mare and starts out the gate going
Weat toward the fields.

              MUNNY
          (over his shoulder)
     I won't be no longer than a couple
     of weeks.  Remember how the spirit
     of your departed maw watches over
     you.

Will and Penny are watching him go and Will is fighting back
the tears but Penny has lost the battle and she is crying
and the horse whinnies.

VIEW ON MUNNY

Twenty yards away getting up off the ground and trying to
catch the shying, prancing horse on foot, his dignity a
shambles.


INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 18

Alice IN PAIN because Skinny is twisting her arm and they
are in Alice's room... it is still night... and the other
whores are there, scared, nervous.

              SKINNY
            (furious)
     Where'd you get the money, huh?

              ALICE
            (in pain)
     We ain't got it.  We ain't got
     no money.

              SKINNY
     You told them cowboys you had it.

              ALICE
     We was... lyin'.

              SKINNY
          (lets her go)
     What you gonna do when somebody
     comes to collect?
            (yelling)
     FUCK 'EM?  FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND
     TIMES?
           (goes to door, then stops)
     The kind of people who'll come after
     that thousand, they won't tolerate if
     you don't have it.  They won't just
     cut your face up a little.
           (screaming)
     STUPID CUNTS!


EXT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE - DAY 19

VIEW on HOT SUN blazing down.

BANG BANG BANG, HAMMER ON NAIL and the fingers holding the
nail are swollen and purple and then... WHUP Hammer on
flesh.

           LITTLE BILL
     Oh, shit, shit an' damn, oh fuck
     my mother and my father, o damn an'
     jesus.

Little Bill is hopping around in his hat and boots and
nothing else in front of his brand new one story, four room,
frame house that hasn't been painted it's so new and doesn't
have a porch yet, though that is being begun... sort of.  In
fact... the house doesn't look quite right... looks a little
lopsided.

Skinny Dubois is standing there, in the clearing wiping his
brow and catching his breath and watching Little Bill.

              SKINNY
     Hit your finger, huh?

           LITTLE BILL
           (surprised)
     Huh?  Hullo, Skinny.  Snuck up on
     me.
     (indicating the house proudly)
     How do you like her?

              SKINNY
          (looking critically)
     Heard you done the roof yourself.

           LITTLE BILL
     Roof?  Jesus, Skinny, I done
     practically every damn thing
     myself.  Roberts boy hauled
     wood, that's all.

              SKINNY
     What's all that wood?

           LITTLE BILL
          (enthusiastically)
     Porch.  I'm puttin' a porch on
     her so's I can puff my pipe of
     an evening an' drink my coffee
     an' watch the sun set.

Little Bill is back at it, hauling a four by six into
position.

           LITTLE BILL
          (over his shoulder,
            proudly)
     You come clear up here just to
     get a look at her?

The train whistle screams loudly below in the valley and
turning nervously, Skinny can see a puff of steam above the
distant trees.

              SKINNY
     Them whores...
             (he pauses, reluctant
            to go on)

Little Bill isn't really paying attention to anything but
his house.

           LITTLE BILL
     Yeah?

              SKINNY
     Them whores, they been fuckin'
     an' fuckin' all them cowboys
     that come into town the last
     two weeks...

           LITTLE BILL
           (chuckling)
     Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons
     an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna
     be the first of the billiard barons.

              SKINNY
          (ignoring him)
     ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an
     tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em
     how they're payin' a thousand dollars
     to whatever sonofabitch kills them
     two boys which cut up Delilah.

Little Bill drops the board he's holding up and turns
sharply to Skinny.  Down in the valley the train whistle
screams and after a long, tense moment, Little Bill turns
and looks out over the valley, frowning.

           LITTLE BILL
     An' all them cowboys been riding
     that beef down to Kansas an'
     Cheyenne?

              SKINNY
     (unhappily, dropping his eyes)
     Yup.

           LITTLE BILL
     All week?

              SKINNY
          (apologetically)
     I didn't hear nothin' till last
     night.

           LITTLE BILL
     Word must have got all the
     way to Texas by now.

              SKINNY
            (quickly)
     Oh, shit, Bill, I guess nobody's
     gonna come clear from Texas.

           LITTLE BILL
          (sitting down)
     They really got all that money,
     them whores?

              SKINNY
             (sitting beside Bill)
     You know how women kin lie... I
     knock 'em around a little, ask 'em
     where the money is, they say they
     don't have none?...but they
     coulda squirreled away that much,
     the five of 'em.  Maybe.
             (pause)

           LITTLE BILL
     That much, huh?

              SKINNY
            (hopeful)
     You could run off them two cowboys.

           LITTLE BILL
            (sharply)
     I could run off them whores.

              SKINNY
          (after a pause)
     Well, I guess they'll just up an'
     run anyhow, them two.

           LITTLE BILL
            (glumly)
     Nope.  They'll stay out on the
     Spade country where they got
     friends.

The train whistle screams down in the valley and the train
is chugging in the distance, pulling out, headed South.

              SKINNY
     Shit, Bill, could be nobody
     won't come at all.


EXT. LOGAN HOUSE - DAY 20

SALLY TWO TREES, weeding under a hot sun.  She is an Indian
woman about forty years old, heavy, and she is pulling weeds
from a neat garden near the Logan House and she looks up and
she sees something and frowns and keeps looking and doesn't
like what she sees,

HER POV:

A MAN IN THE DISTANCE RIDING AN ALBINO MARE, making his way
slowly through the prosperous fields of young corn.

VIEW ON SALLY

She looks over at her husband, NED LOGAN, who is working not
far away and he seems to "hear" her look because he turns to
her and, seeing her troubled expression, he follows her look
and he too sees the rider on the Albino mare.

               NED
     I'll be damned.  It's Billy Munny.

Ned is about forty, balding, a farmer, but not as seedy
looking as his old friend, Bill Munny.

VIEW ON MUNNY

Trying to dismount and the Albino prancing and Munny
staggering and Sally looking at the scene grimly.

              MUNNY
           (awkwardly)
     Hullo Sally... I... uh, I
     ain't seen you in near as long
     as this, uh... as this horse
     ain't felt the saddle.

Munny gets up out of the dust looking uncomfortable and
Sally just stares at him coldly.

               NED
            (warmly)
     Come on in outta the sun, Bill.
     Sally, you see to Bill's horse.

Munny nods an uncomfortable thank-you to Sally as Ned leads
him toward a house that is very different from Munny's.  It
is a two story frame house freshly painted and surrounded by
a well-tended garden, a tool shed, a barn and lush fields.

As the men disappear into the house Sally leads the Albino
toward the barn.  Her sharp eyes don't miss the stock of the
shotgun where it protrudes slightly from the bedroll.  Her
eyes seem to see even into the future... and all they see is
trouble.


INT. LOGAN HOUSE - DAY 21

CLOSE on CLEAN CERAMIC COFFEE MUGS as NED takes them from a
tidy cabinet in his cozy kitchen with the cast iron stove,
the solid table.

Munny is sitting at the table looking moodily into space.

               NED
           (earnestly)
          We ain't bad men no more, Bill.
          Hell, we're farmers.

              MUNNY
          (thoughtfully)
          Should be easy killin' em...
          supposin' they don't run off to
          Texas first.

               NED
             (taking the pot from
           the stove)
          How long since you shot a gun at a
          man?      (pause)
          Nine... ten years?

              MUNNY
          Eleven.

               NED
          Easy, huh?  Hell, I don't know that
          it was all that easy then... an'
          we was young an' full of beans.
          (pouring coffee)
          Bill... if you was mad at 'em...
          if they done you wrong... I could
          see shootin' 'em...

              MUNNY
            (looking Ned in the eye)
          We done stuff before for money,
          Ned.

               NED
          (sitting down)
          Well, we thought we was doin' it
          for money...
           (he pauses, remembering)
          What'd they do anyhow?  Cheat at
          cards, steal some strays, spit
          on a rich fella?

              MUNNY
          Cut up a woman.  Cut her eyes out,
          cut her tits off, cut her fingers
          off... done everythin' but cut
          up her cunny, I guess.

               NED
            (after chewing on that
               one)
          Well, I guess they got it comin'...
           (and he pauses and looks
           Munny in the eye)
          But you wouldn't go if Claudia was
          alive.

It hits Munny like salt in a wound and he just takes it.
They both know Ned is right and they think about it
silently.  Finally Munny speaks glumly.

              MUNNY
          (getting up and
           going to the door)
          I guess you wouldn't mind to look
          in on my youngsters next week.
          Might be you could help them move
          a couple of them pigs if they got
          to separate 'em more.

Ned has been thinking about it while Munny's talking,
wrestling with it and now Munny is out the door.

               NED
          How long you gonna be, Bill?

              MUNNY
          Two weeks, I guess.

               NED
          This Kid, what's he like?

Munny turns and looks at Ned and their eyes meet and Munny
realizes Ned is coming.

               NED
          Three ways?

              MUNNY
          Yup.  You still got the Spencer
          rifle?

               NED
          (grinning)
          Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird
          in the eye flyin'.


EXT. LOGAN HOUSE - DAY 22

Munny landing with a thud in the dust and picking himself up
hurriedly and casting a sheepish glance over his shoulder at
Ned as he makes another awkward effort to mount the mare.

               NED
          (amazed at this per-
            formance)
          Jesus, Bill.

CLOSE VIEW

The sad, wise eyes of Sally Two Trees as she watches the two
riders disappearing in the distance.  her eyes are saying
good-bye.


EXT. PATH - DAY 23

THE RIDERS IN THE DISTANCE.  One horse is walking and the
white one is prancing and shying in an unruly manner while
her rider fights desperately for control.


EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 24

SUNSET, and Ned and Munny riding in open country.

               NED
     He musta been movin' right along.

              MUNNY
     We'll come across him tomorra,
     I guess.


EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 25

Night and the sizzling campfire as Ned empties the grease
from the frying pan into the fire.

Munny is already lying down, fussing in his blankets to get
comfortable and the crickets are chirping up a storm.

              MUNNY
     Got used to my bed.  Ain't gonna
     feel to home out here.

               NED
          (getting into his blankets)
     Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna
     miss.  I'm...
          (he stops suddenly)
     Hell, Billy, I'm sorry.  I didn't
     mean...

              MUNNY
     It ain't nothin', don't fret it.
             (pause)
     She don't like it much, you goin'
     off with me.

               NED
     Sally?

              MUNNY
     She gave me the evil eye.

               NED
     It's just... she's a Indian an'
     Indians ain't... overfriendly.

              MUNNY
     I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't
     holdin' it against her.
             (pause)
     She knew me back then... an' she seen
     what a no good sonofabitch I was...
     an' she won't allow how I've changed.
     She just don't know how I ain't like
     that no more.

               NED
     Well, she...

              MUNNY
           (urgently)
     I ain't the same, Ned.  Claudia,
     she... straightened me up, got me
     clear of the whiskey an' all.  Us
     goin' to do this killin'... that
     don't mean I'm back to like I was.
     I just need the money... for a new
     start... for them youngsters.
          (long pause)
     Remember that drover, the one I
     shot in the mouth so's the teeth
     come out the back of his head?  I
     dream about him now an' again.  I
     didn't have no reason to shoot
     him... not one I could remember
     when I sobered up.

               NED
     You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.

              MUNNY
     Nobody liked me... none of the
     boys.  They was scared of me...
     figured I might shoot 'em out of
     pure meanness.

               NED
     You ain't like that no more.

              MUNNY
     Eagle... he hated my guts.
     Bonaparte didn't like me none.

               NED
     Nor Quincy, I guess.

              MUNNY
     Quincy, he was always watchin' me.
     Scared.

               NED
     You ain't like that no more.

              MUNNY
     Hell, no.  I'm just a fella now.
     ain't no different from anyone else
     no more.

After a pause, Ned rolls over to go to sleep and says
something kind by way of saying goodnight.

               NED
     Hell, Bill, I always liked you...
     even back then.

Ned settles in his covers and so does Munny and the crickets
chirp for a long moment but Munny can't sleep with the lie.

              MUNNY
     No you didn't.  You wasn't no
     different, Ned.
           (and we...)


EXT. TRAIN - DAY 26

DAYLIGHT and a train whistle SCREAMING.


INT. RAILROAD COACH - DAY 27

The headline on the newspaper says "President Garfield
Wounded."  FUZZY, a cowboy, is sitting in the rocking coach
reading the paper with great effort, partly because of the
motion of the train and partly because Fuzzy can't read very
well... but CROCKER, the rough looking cowboy on the seat
next to him can't read at all.

             CROCKER
     All I want to know is what sonof-
     abitch shot him, that's all.  Was
     it one of them John Bull assholes?

Across the aisle two well dressed gentlemen are sitting.
The one by the window, the lean one in the frock coat and
slouch hat, is WW BEAUCHAMP and the one on the aisle, pudgy,
pinkcheeked, with neat muttonchop whiskers, wearing a frock
coat and waistcoat and a silk slouch hat in spite of the
heat, is ENGLISH BOB.  English Bob has beady blue eyes, is
about thirty-five and pulls constantly on a good cigar.

           ENGLISH BOB
           (in a rich English accent)
     No, sir, I believe the would-be
     murderer is a gentleman of French
     ancestry... or so it would seem.
     I hope I won't give offense if I
     observe that the French are known
     to be a race of assassins, though
     they can't shoot worth a
     damn...any Frenchman among the
     present company excluded of
     course.

Crocker, not liking or understanding the interruption, gives
English Bob a hard stare.

              FUZZY
           (to Crocker)
     Says here a fellow by the name of
     "Gitto."   "G-U-I--T..."

             CROCKER
          (eyes on Bob)
     Sounds like a damn John Bull to me.
     "Gitto."

THIRSTY, a cowboy sitting behind Crocker, turns in his seat,
sensing the tension in the air and WW feels it too and
shifts uneasily... but English Bob is unperturbed and he
puffs cheerfully on his cigar.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Well, sirs... again not wishing to
     give offense... it might be a good
     idea if the country were to choose
     a Queen... or even a King
     ...rather than a president.  One
     isn't as quick to take a shot at a
     King or a Queen.  The majesty of
     royalty, you see...

             CROCKER
          (provocative)
     Maybe you don't wish to give
     offense, sir, but you are givin'
     it pretty thick.  This country
     don't need no queens whatsoever, I
     guess.

Crocker is shifting in his seat so that the revolver in his
holster is prominent and there is uneasy stirring among the
nearby passengers.  A DRUMMER looks around for exits.

             CROCKER
     As a matter of fact, what I
     heard about Queens...

             THURSTON
     Shut up, Joe.

             CROCKER
          (to Thurston)
     Huh?  What's got up your ass,
     Thirsty?  This dude asshole...

             THURSTON
           (to Crocker, but
          his eyes on Bob)
     Might be the "dude" is English Bob
     ...the one who works for the Union
     Pacific shootin' Chinamen.  Might
     be he wants for some dumb cowboy
     to touch his pistol...  so's he
     can shoot him down.

English Bob, unperturbed, just pulls on his cigar.

             CROCKER
            (sobered)
     That a fact, mister?  You English
     Bob?

           ENGLISH BOB
            (affably)
     Why don't we shoot some turkeys,
     friend?  Ten shots... a dollar
     a turkey.   I'll shoot for the
     Queen, and you can shoot for...
     whomever.


EXT. TRAIN - DAY 28

Turkeys bursting from long Nebrasks grass as the train
whistle screams.

BLAM!  A turkey plummets to earth.

BLAM!  Another goes down.

VIEW ON ENGLISH BOB

On the swaying platform between cars, his pistol smoking and
BOB brings it up again fast and sights and BLAM!

AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS plummeting down and disappearing in
the long grass.

VIEW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATFORM

Where WW Beauchamp, Crocker, Thurston, Fuzzy and the nervous
Drummer, in a cheap bowler, are standing.   They are all
impressed with the fact that English Bob is one hell of a
shot with a pistol.

           ENGLISH BOB
           (to Crocker)
     I believe that's eight for me...
     to one for you.  A matter of
     seven of your American dollars.

             CROCKER
             (grudgingly counting
          silver dollars)
     Pretty damn good shootin'....
            (daring)
     for a John Bull.

           ENGLISH BOB
             (accepting the money
           cheerfully)
     No doubt your aim was affected by
     your grief over the injury to your
     ... uh... president.


EXT. TRAIN STOP - DAY 29

Bawling cattle milling in the pens south of Big Whiskey, and
the train hissing and steaming at a standstill.

CLOSE VIEW

Two leather valises and a leather rifle case as MUDDY
CHANDLER tosses them on his mud wagon, a sort of open
stagecoach.  The scene is one of chaos as the train steams
and hisses and baggage is tossed off and more is tossed on.

             CHANDLER
     It's a nickel up to Big Whiskey,
     gentlemen.

WW hands Chandler the money and, as he and English Bob climb
into the mud wagon, they are accosted by GERMANY JOE SCHULTZ
who runs the livery stable and does horse business with
railway passengers on the side.

           GERMANY JOE
     I godd nize horzes I zell you,
     boyce.  Nize prizes for
     Independence Day, boyce.


EXT. MUD WAGON - DAY 30

English Bob and WW riding in the mud wagon, bouncing
uncomfortably in spite of the slow pace, and eating dust and
sweating profusely.

           ENGLISH BOB
           (irritably)
     It's the climate does it.  That
     and the infernal distances.

               WW
     Does what?

           ENGLISH BOB
     Induces people to shoot persons
     in high places.
           (mopping his brow with his
          (handkerchief)
     It's a savage country.  That's
     the second one shot in twenty
     years.  It's uncivilized shooting
     people of substance.

The mud wagon rattles past the South Road sign.  It is
similar to the one of the North Road and says:

     No Firearms in Big Whiskey.
     Ordinance 14.
     Deposit pistols and rifles
     County Office.


EXT. BIG WHISKY INN - DAY 31

Deputy ANDY RUSSELL stepping out of the County Office as the
mud wagon clatters to a stop in front of the Big Whisky Inn.

Andy is just twenty, a good looking kid with a badge on his
vest and a holstered pistol.  He watches the passengers
climb out of the mud wagon and, as English Bob alights, his
frock coat parts and gives ANDY just the quickest glimpse of
a holstered pistol under the coat.

              ANDY
     Pardon me, gentlemen, but local
     ordinance obliges you to surrender
     your sidearms to proper authority
     for the duration of your visit.

WW looks at English Bob and English Bob turns and looks Andy
up and down very coolly.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Proper authority eh?
           (breezily)
     Well, sir... neither my companion
     nor I carry firearms on our
     persons.  Rather, we trust in
     the goodwill of our fellow man
     and the forbearance of reptiles.

And English Bob gives a smart bow, turns with a swirl of
coat-tails that allows a brief glimpse of not one, but two
holstered pistols, and marches off.  As WW follows English
Bob, he glances nervously back to see what young Andy will
do but Andy just stares nonplussed.  In that quick glimpse,
Andy saw how the weapons were tied down with thongs, meaning
the owner wanted a quick pull... and this shit is out of his
league.


INT. COUNTY OFFICE - DAY 32

KER-CHICK, CLACK, A HENRY RIFLE COCKED and the action
checked.  Andy is cleaning the weapon in the County Office.

              ANDY
     Unarmed, my ass.

SHUCK, KA-CHAK.  CHARLEY HECKER breaks open a single
barreled shotgun and moves a shell in.

             CHARLEY
           (wiping his brow
            nervously)
     Christ, it's hot.

              FATTY
          ((cheerfully)
     If I'm gonna get shot, I druther
     it was hot then cold.  Everythin'
     hurts more in the cold.

Fatty is sitting in a chair in front of the empty jail cell
cleaning a revolver, oblivious to the tension.

          FATTY (cont'd)
     You know how if you hit your thumb
     in the cold, how it...?

             CHARLEY
     Shut up, Fatty.

              FATTY
     I only said...

Outside a horse clatters up fast and Andy jumps nervously to
the window.

               ANDY
     Clyde's back.

             CHARLEY
     Little Bill with him?

               ANDY
     No.

             CHARLEY
            (worried)
     Shit.

Clyde bursts in the door.  He is wearing two gun-belts
crossed, with a holster on each side.  Since he has only one
arm, he carries one pistol butt forward and the other butt
back.

              CLYDE
     You boys clean my Remington?

              FATTY
          (holding it up)
     Cleaned an' loaded.

             CHARLEY
     Where's Little Bill for Christ
     sake?

              CLYDE
            (inspecting the pistol)
     Ha.  He was building his fucking
     porch.

             CHARLEY
     Building his porch!

              FATTY
     If you was to get shot, Andy,
     would you like it better to be
     a hot day or...?

              ANDY
            (sharply)
     I ain't gonna get shot.

             CHARLEY
            (to Clyde)
     He's coming ain't he?

              CLYDE
           (ejecting shells)
     'Course he's coming.

              FATTY
     Hey, I just loaded her.  Watcha
     doin?

              CLYDE
     I don't trust nobody to load my
     guns, not for a shootin'.

             CHARLEY
     What'd he say?

              CLYDE
     Little Bill?  He didn't say nothing.
     Like I said, he was buildin' his
     porch.  Have you seen that thing?

              FATTY
            (sulking)
     It was all loaded.  Jesus, Clyde,
     you got three pistols an' only
     one arm for Christ sake.

              CLYDE
           (to Fatty)
     I just don't wanna get killed for
     lack of shootin' back.
          (to Charley)
     You know there ain't a straight
     angle in that whole goddamn
     porch... or in the whole house
     for that matter.  He's the worst
     fucking carpenter.

             CHARLEY
            (worried)
     He didn't say nothin', huh?

              CLYDE
            (putting the 3rd pistol
           in his belt)
     Asked what they looked like,
     that's all.  Christ, maybe he's
     tough but he sure ain't no
     carpenter.

             CHARLEY
     Maybe he ain't so tough.

Clyde looks up, surprised.  There is a sudden silence.

              ANDY
          (blurting it)
     He seem like... like he was...
     scared?

              CLYDE
            (amazed)
     Little Bill?  Him scared?

             CHARLEY
     We never seen him up against
     any... like these ones... killers.

              CLYDE
           (looking at the frightened
           faces of Charley and Andy)
     Little Bill come out of Kansas
     an' Texas, boys.  He worked
     them tough towns.

             CHARLEY
            (ashamed)
     Just wondered.  Anybody could
     be scared.

Andy drops his eyes and looks away from Clyde.

              CLYDE
          (with meaning)
     No.  He wasn't scared, boys.
     He just ain't a good carpenter.


INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY 33

English Bob, delighting in the smooth feel of his freshly
shaved pink cheeks, climbs cheerfully out of the barber
chair, still chattering at the poor BARBER.

           ENGLISH BOB
     ...can see that there's a dignity
     in royalty... a majesty... that
     precludes the likelihood of
     assassination.

The Barber is applying his little whisk broom to Bob's
waistcoat while WW pulls out his purse to make payment.

          ENGLISH BOB contd.
     Why, if you were to point a pistol
     at a King or a Queen, sir, I can
     assure you your hand would shake
     as though palsied...

              BARBER
           (looking at Bob's
             pistols)
     I wouldn't point no pistol at
     nobody, sir.

           ENGLISH BOB
             (putting on his frock
          coat over his guns)
     A wise policy.  But if you did,
     I can assure you, the sight of
     royalty would cause you to
     dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed
     and stand... in awe.
             (pause)
     Whereas, a president... I mean,
     why not shoot a president?

The Barber doesn't know how to take this guy, and just ogles
him.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Now this Strawberry Alice person,
     tell me again.

              BARBER
     Down the street and across.  Greely's
     Beer Garden and Billiard parlor.
     Just ask for Alice and say you want
     a game of billiards.

           ENGLISH BOB
          (about to exit)
     Billiards, eh?  Even though I
     don't really wish to play?

              BARBER
     Don't matter.  They burned the
     table in '78 for firewood.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Ah, I see.

WW has already stepped out and English Bob follows him out
the door.


EXT. BARBERSHOP/MAIN STREET - DAY 34

English Bob steps out the door.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Come on, WW.  Let's...

Something's wrong!  There is a funny quiet and WW is frozen
like a ramrod.  English Bob looks around.

VIEW ON CHARLIE HECKER

Ten yards to Bob's right, pointing a 12 gauge shotgun and
Fatty Rossiter a few feet away pointing his old Enfield.

VIEW ON ANDY RUSSELL

On Bob's left, pale and tense, pointing his Henry, and Clyde
Ledbetter kneeling near him, leveling one of his pistols.

VIEW ON LITTLE BILL

Standing ten yards away in the empty dusty street where the
Fourth of July flags are flapping.

           LITTLE BILL
     Hullo, Bob.  Boys, this here is
     English Bob.

           ENGLISH BOB
          (under his breath)
     Shit and fried eggs.

           LITTLE BILL
     Been a long time, Bob.  You run
     out of Chinamen?

           ENGLISH BOB
          (recovering his composure)
     Little Bill, I thought you were
     dead.  I see you shaved off your
     chin whiskers.

           LITTLE BILL
          (feeling his chin)
     Well, I was always tasting the
     soup two hours after I et it.

VIEW ON THE STREET

Empty, silent.

VIEW

FACES IN THE WINDOW of the Blue Bottle restaurant.  EGGS
ANDERSON, TOM LUCKINBILL, MRS. PEEVEY, HOPPITY THOMAS,
peering out.

VIEW

Alice, Kate and Little Sue in Greely's window and, in the
open doorway, ready to duck for cover, Skinny and Germany
Joe Schultz and PADDY McGEE, the cooper.

VIEW ON ENGLISH BOB

           ENGLISH BOB
     What I heard was that you fell
     off your horse drunk and broke
     your neck.

           LITTLE BILL
     I heard that one myself, Bob.
     Hell, I even thought I was dead
     til I found out it was just I
     was in Nebraska.
             (pause)
     Who's your friend?

           ENGLISH BOB
     WW Beauchamp... Little Bill
     Daggett and... "friends."

               WW
            (nervous)
     From N-n-newton?... and H-hays
     and A-a-abilene?

           ENGLISH BOB
             (dryly)
     The same.

Charley is taking all this in wide-eyed.

           LITTLE BILL
     You work for the railroads too,
     Mister Beauchamp?

     N-no.  I wr-wr-wr-write...
     I wr-wr-write...

           LITTLE BILL
     Letters?

           ENGLISH BOB
     Books.  He's my biographer.

           LITTLE BILL
          (fighting amazement)
     Oh.

And WW is reaching for a pocket.

Andy and Charley and Clyde and Fatty tensing to fire.

VIEW ON ENGLISH BOB

           ENGLISH BOB
     I wouldn't do it, WW.

WW freezes, terrified... and a puddle of urine forms at his
feet.

               WW
     It's only a b-b-b-book...

           LITTLE BILL
            (his pistol half-drawn)
     A book, huh?
             (returning his pistol
           and glancing at the piss)
     I guess that means you can read...
     An' I guess you boys seen them
     signs about surrendering your
     firearms... But then, like you
     told old Andy there, you ain't
     armed, are you, Bob?

           ENGLISH BOB
     Not really...
           (shrugging)
     Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...
           (bargaining)
     I imagine you could overlook those,
     eh, Bill?  If you didn't see them...
     or hear them?

           LITTLE BILL
          (cold as ice)
     I guess not, Bob.  I don't like
     guns around.

With a sardonic glance at the arsenal trained on him English
Bob gives a shrug and holds open his coat in surrender,
exposing two fancy holstered pistols.

Little Bill gives Andy a head signal and Andy steps forward
and takes the pistols from English Bob's holsters.

           LITTLE BILL
     Charley, see what kind of "books"
     Mister Beauchamp is packing...
     but watch you don't get wet.

           ENGLISH BOB
            (to Andy)
     Be careful with those, sonny.

Onlookers are stepping out of doorways now and moving
timidly into the street forming a large semi-circle.  The
whores are among them.

             CHARLEY
     No shit, Little Bill, all he's
     got is this here book.

Charley holds up a dime novel with a lurid cover showing a
gentleman in a top hat protecting a woman with his body
while firing two pistols at seven disheveled looking
"Western types."  The title is "The Duke of Death."

           LITTLE BILL
             (reading with effort)
     The... Duck of Death.

               WW
     D-d-d-duke.  The D-d-duke of
     Death.

English Bob starts to go but Little Bill puts a hand on his
shoulder.

           LITTLE BILL
     Give me the .32, Bob.

Furious, English Bob turns and looks into Bill's eyes and
then, seeing no alternative, opens his vest esposing a small
pistol.

           ENGLISH BOB
     You leave me at the mercy of my
     enemies.

           LITTLE BILL
          (taking the pistol)
     Enemies, Bob?  You been talking
     about the Queen again?  On
     Independence Day?

A lot of the tension has gone out of the occasion and the
crowd is beginning to murmur and people are starting to move
and a couple of kids are running when suddenly...

CRUNCH! English Bob's face seems to cave in with the force
of Little Bill's fist and Bob literally flies backward and
slams into the side of the barber shop.

VIEW

Alice gasping... Andy's jaw drops... Little Sue's eyes
bulge...  Charley gulps.

VIEW ON ENGLISH BOB

Slumped against the wall, blood pouring from his unhinged
jaw, amazed.

           ENGLISH BOB
     Wh... what... ?

Little Bill walks calmly up to him and WHAM... kicks him
hard in the chest.

VIEW

Silky having a hard time swallowing and Mrs. Peevey turning
away and Eggs horrified and Alice's scared face.

VIEW ON ENGLISH BOB

Bloody, on all fours, pulling a knife from his waistcoat...
but the whole effort is painful and hopeless.  He hasn't a
chance.

Little Bill looks down at him for a moment from his enormous
height, watching the smaller man's pitiful effort, then
SLAM!... Little Bill kicks him in the ribs hard and you can
hear air going out of Bob, and Bill steps hard on Bob's
knofe hand and the bones crunch loudly.

VIEW

WW, white as a ghost and Andy is trying not to vomit.  There
is the sound of another brutal blow.

VIEW

English Bob on all fours in the dusty street now, barely
conscious.

KA-WHUMP! Little Bill kicks him again, not angrily, but
hard.

           LITTLE BILL
     I guess you think I'm kickin'
     you, Bob... but it ain't so.
          (WHAM, another kick)
     What I'm doin' is talkin', hear?
     I'm talkin' to all them villains
     down in Kansas an' them villains
     in Cheyenne...
             (WHUMP)
     Lettin' em know there ain't no
     whores' gold...

Little Bill turns and looks hard at the whores and Alice is
sick from the violence and Little Sue is biting her lip and
Silky has tears in her eyes.

           LITTLE BILL
             (turning back to Bob
           and kicking him)
     ...an' how if there was...
     how they wouldn't want to come
     lookin' for it anyhow.

Little Bill looks down with eyes as cold as ice and English
Bob grovels in the bloody dust, barely conscious.


EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 35

Open country under a hot sun and Munny and Ned riding their
horses at a walk and the saddles creaking and birds chirping
in the five foot high grass.  It is late morning in Northern
Kansas and they have been riding since dawn, mostly in
silence, but Ned has something on his mind and he glances at
Munny and frowns and then finally he blurts his question.

               NED
     Say, Bill... You ever... ever
     go into town... an' all?

              MUNNY
           (surprised at the
            question)
     Sure, I got to.  Got to get supplies.

               NED
     No.  I mean...
          (embarrassed)
     ...an' get yourself a woman?
     You know?

Munny looks away quickly, embarrassed, and it seems like he
isn't going to answer and then, when he finally does, he
keeps his eyes on the horizon.

              MUNNY
     Naw.  Naw, I don't ever go into
     town for that.
             (pause)
     A man like me... A man like me
     can't get no woman but one he's
     gonna pay for... an' that ain't
     right... buyin' flesh.
          (looking at Ned)
     Claudia, God rest her soul, she
     wouldn't have wanted me doin'
     nothin' like that, me bein' a
     father, an' all.
             (he looks away again)

               NED
          (rhetorically)
     Whaddaya do, just use your hand?

              MUNNY
           (after a nervous
          glance at Ned)
     Sometimes... yeah.
          (looking at the
             horizon)
     I don't miss it all that much.

Ned is shaking his head, wondering at the transformation of
his old friend when...

CRACK!  A RIFLE SHOT and the Albino mare rears violently,
whinnying and hurling Munny out of the saddle and...

Ned's roan bolts at full speed, Ned barely staying aboard.

CRACK! another shot.

VIEW ON MUNNY

On all fours in the tall grass.  He feels his forehead and
wipes away a little blood, and shakes his head to clear it.
Then he hears rustling in the long grass and he whirls and
pulls the Starr out of his belt and sitting back he aims at
where he heard the noise and he pulls back the hammer with a
loud click.

           NED'S VOICE
           (a whisper)
     Billy.  Billy.

              MUNNY
             (lowering the pistol,
            relieved)
     Yeah.

Ned crawls out of the grass next to Munny.

               NED
     Some fucker's shootin' at us.

              MUNNY
     Yeah.

               NED
            (alarmed, seeing blood)
     He hit you?

              MUNNY
     Naw.  I bumped my head fallin'
     off of my horse.

CRACK, another shot.  Ned looks puzzled and he lifts his
head up and tries to look around without exposing himself.

A hundred yards away Ned can see a clump of four or five
trees and there is a little cloud of black smoke still
hanging in the air there and then a sudden flash of fire,
smoke and CRACK!

Ned doesn't even duck, he just frowns.

               NED
     He ain't shootin' our way no more.
             (indicating the left)
     He's shootin' over that way.  Who's
     he shootin' at over that way?

              MUNNY
     Beats the hell out of me.

               NED
     You suppose maybe we're in
     somebody's field?

              MUNNY
     I didn't see nothin' planted.

CRACK.  Another shot.  Ned ducks urgently.

               NED
     Fuck, he's shootin' at us again.

CRACK, CRACK, CRACK.

               NED
     Jesus, he's shootin' up the
     whole fucking horizon.

Munny is thinkinh about it, has an idea, weighs it and gives
it a try.

              MUNNY
           (shouting)
     HEY.

               NED
     You're marking us, Bill.

              MUNNY
          (ignoring him)
     HEY, KID.

               NED
     Kid?  The Kid's shootin at us?

              MUNNY
     IS THAT YOU, KID?

               NED
     Why would the Kid shoot at us?

              MUNNY
     HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.


EXT. TREES - DAY 36

The Kid rifle at his cheek is crouched behind one of the
trees.  His horse is standing nearby.

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Hey, Kid, is that you?  It's
     me, Bill Munny.

The Kid is frowning and finally he makes up his mind.

             THE KID
           (shouting)
     YEAH.  IT'S ME.

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Don't shoot at us no more, okay?

The Kid is peering around the tree and squinting
ferociously.

HIS POV:

The field.  It is one big blur.  He can't see worth a shit.

The Kid squinting and peering and worrying.

             THE KID
     WHO YOU GOT WITH YOU?

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Ned Logan.  My old partner, Ned
     Logan.  Don't you shoot no more,
     okay?

The Kid doesn't like it, he's nervous and twitching, trying
desperately to see what's going  on out there.

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     We're gonna collect our horses an'
     come on over.  You ain't gonna
     shoot no more, are you?

             THE KID
     NO, I AIN'T.


EXT. TREES - DAY 37

VIEW ON MUNNY

Bedraggled and sweaty, walking into the clump of trees
leading his horse and Ned, behind him, leading his roan and
looking just as bad.

              MUNNY
     Had to chase the damn horse a
     mile.

The Kid is sitting under the shade tree looking sullen.

               NED
             (angry)
     What was you shootin' at us
     for, anyhow?

             THE KID
     Thought you was followin' me.

              MUNNY
     Well, we was.  Like you said,
     I changed my mind an'...

             THE KID
     Wasn't nothin' said about no
     partner.

               NED
     Well, this here's Ned Logan...
     Ned, this here's the Schofield
     Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...

             THE KID
     I seen two fellas followin' me,
     I guessed they come to kill me.
             (pause)
     We didn't talk about no other fella.

              MUNNY
             (squatting in front of
          The Kid, talking in
           a persuasive tone)
     Well, now Kid, there's two of
     these cowboys, ain't that so?
     Better there's three of us...
     maybe them cowboys got friends.
     Maybe...

             THE KID
     I was gonna kill them two by
     myself.  It don't take three.

Ned walks over to where The Kid's rifle is leaning against
the tree and The Kid is watching nervously.

              MUNNY
     Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a
     rifle.  Hell, he can hit a bird
     in the eye flyin'.

               NED
             (picking up The Kid's
              rifle)
     Better'n you anyhow, Kid.  You
     wasn't comin' close.

             THE KID
     Keep your damn hands offa that
     rifle, Mister.

The Kid is touching his pistol and Ned puts the rifle down,
annoyed.

               NED
     I was only checkin' it for you.
     Thought maybe somethin' was bent.

             THE KID
     Nothin's bent.

               NED
     Well, you was shootin' every
     which way an'...

             THE KID
           (to Munny)
     You gonna share your half with him?

              MUNNY
     Three ways, I figured.

             THE KID
     No.

              MUNNY
             (to Ned)
     Sorry, Ned.  Guess I wasted your
     time.  See ya, Kid!

Munny turns to go and Ned gives The Kid a disgusted look and
turns away.

             THE KID
           (to Munny)
     You're goin' back with him?

              MUNNY
            (turning)
     He's my partner.  He don't go,
     I don't.

Ned is mounted and Munny starts to mount too, but the mare
is as reluctant as ever, shying and prancing while MUNNY
hops awkwardly with one foot in the stirrup.

             THE KID
     What's it come to, three ways?

Munny turns and looks at The Kid.


EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 38

The three of them riding across open country.  The Kid looks
like he still has a thorn up his ass and the only sound is
the creaking of saddles.

Storm clouds are gathering behind them on the horizon.

              MUNNY
     Oh shit.

And The Kid looks back but of course he can't figure out
what it is they saw.

             THE KID
     What the hell are you pissin'
     about, I'd like to know?

              MUNNY
          (astonished)
     Huh?

             THE KID
     Well, what were you lookin' at
     anyhow?

              MUNNY
     Lookin' at?

               NED
     Clouds, Kid.  We was lookin' at
     them clouds on account of we got
     a storm ridin' up our ass.

             THE KID
          (looking back)
     Oh, them.
          (petulantly)
     Hell, I seen them.

Ned frowns and looks at The Kid and something is bothering
Ned.


EXT. STREAM BED - DAY 39

A dry stream bed and the three men are riding single file
now with The Kid in the lead but Ned has been thinking and,
trotting with his horse, he pulls alongside The Kid.

               NED
     You was right to change your mind,
     Kid.

             THE KID
          (surly, suspicious)
     Yeah?

               NED
            (proudly)
     I'm a damn good shot.
           (looking up)
     See that hawk up there?  I could
     kill that hawk with one shot.

VIEW on the empty sky.  There isn't any hawk.

VIEW on Munny who is right beside them is looking up and he
doesn't see any hawk and he looks at Ned like he thought Ned
was crazy and he frowns.

The Kid just looks up and squints and looks ahead at the
trail and keeps riding.

             THE KID
     Hell, I could hit it too if I
     didn't mind wasting a shot.

And Munny looks up again, amazed, because they must be
crazy, both of them.

And Ned reins his horse hard.

               NED
     There ain't no hawk up there,
     Kid.

And the Kid reins and turns and he locks eyes with Ned.  He
knows he's been found out.

               NED
     Can't see worth a shit, can you?

The Kid is furious, his eyes flick around and he spots
something and he pulls out the Schofield.

             THE KID
     See them fucking turtles?

VIEW ON THREE TURTLES

Making their way up the stream bed ten yards away.

VIEW ON THE KID

His Schofield spitting fire and smoke BLAM, BLAM.

VIEW ON THE TURTLE

BLAM, the third turtle exploding and following the other two
to oblivion.

VIEW ON THE MEN

              MUNNY
           (impressed)
     Shit.

               NED
          (impressed but holding back)
     How far kin you see?

             THE KID
     Far enough.

               NED
     We ain't goin' to Nebraska on
     no turtle hunt.  A hundred yards?

             THE KID
     More.

               NED
            (testing)
     See that scrub oak yonder?

             THE KID
            (furious)
     Fuck you.

               NED
            (to Munny)
     He's blind, for Chri...

             THE KID
             (pointing his pistol
             at Ned)
     I ain't blind, you asshole.

              MUNNY
     Now hold on, boys, hold on.  Now,
     Kid, you kin see fifty yards,
     can't you?

             THE KID
     Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards
     an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...

              MUNNY
     Easy, Kid, easy.
           (looking Ned in the eye)
     Now, you hear that, Ned?  The Kid
     can see fifty yards fine, hear?

               NED
          (under his breath)
     Jesus.

              MUNNY
     Fifty yards ain't bad.
           (glancing at the horizon)
     Guess we better get along.


EXT. SKY - DAY 40

STORM CLOUDS building behind them on the horizon.


INT. COUNTY OFFICE - NIGHT 41

CLOSE ON A BOOK

The lurid cover, "The Duke of Death" by W. W. Beauchamp.
Little Bill is looking at the cover, his feet propped on his
desk in the county office.  It is night and the office is
lit with an oil lamp.

           LITTLE BILL
            (referring to the book)
     Them boys look like real hard
     cases.  Did you kill all seven of
     'em dead, Bob... or did you just
     wing some of 'em?

English Bob is lying on his back on a cot in the little cell
a few feet away.  He turns his head toward Little Bill and
his swollen face is horrible to behold.  Of course, he
doesn't answer except with the nasty eye.

           LITTLE BILL
     That is you there, ain't it, Bob?
     The Duck of Death?

               WW
            (daring)
     Uh... Duke.

WW is in the little cell next to English Bob's.

           LITTLE BILL
     Oh yeah... Duke.  Well, Bob, you
     always was hell an' Jesus with a
     pistol... but seven of 'em, an'
     you protectin' the lady too...
     How'd you do it?

English Bob just turns his malignant stare away but WW
screws up his courage and asserts himself... sort of.

               WW
     Uh... It's... uh... generally
     considered desirable in the
     publishing business to... ah...
     take certain license in depicting
     the cover scene... for... ah...
     purposes involving the... ah,
     market place.

           LITTLE BILL
     Well, Mister Beauchamp... from
     what I read of this here book,
     I'd have to say the writin' ain't
     a whole lot different from the
     pitcher.

               WW
          (sweating, but with
            dignity)
     Uh... I can assure you, Mister
     Daggett... the events described
     within are based... on the accounts
     of eye witnesses and...

           LITTLE BILL
          (opening the book)
     Meaning the duck himself, I guess.

               WW
     Duke.

           LITTLE BILL
            (harshly)
     Duck, I says.
          (reading badly)
     "You have insulted the honor of
     this beautiful woman, Corcoran,"
     said the duck.  "You must
     apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran
     would have none of it and,
     cursing, he reached for his
     pistols and would have killed them
     but The Duck was faster and hot
     lead blazed from his smoking
     sixguns."
          (he tosses the book
           on the desk, disgusted)

               WW
          (with dignity)
     I believe that to be an accurate
     description of the events, sir...
     albeit there is a certain poetry
     to the language which...

           LITTLE BILL
          (standing up)
     Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at
     the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita
     the night English Bob killed Corky
     Corcoran... an' I didn't see you
     there... nor no woman, nor no
     two-gun shooters nor nothin'
     like that.

               WW
            (amazed)
     You were there?

WW looks to English Bob for confirmation but Bob's stare
just gets nastier.

Little Bill is warming to the subject though, standing in
front of the cell.

           LITTLE BILL
     First off... Corky didn't carry
     two pistols, though he should of.

               WW
     But he was called...

           LITTLE BILL
     Some folks did call Old Corky "Two
     Gun" but not because he was
     sportin' two pistols but because
     he had a dick so big it was longer
     than the barrel on that Walker
     Colt he carried.  An' the only
     insultin' he done was stickin'
     that big dick of his in some
     French Lady that Old Bob was sweet
     on...  Well, one day Corky walked
     into the Blue Bottle and before he
     knows what's happening Bob takes a
     shot at him... and misses on
     account of he's drunker than hell.

WW is fascinated and he looks to Bob and BOB'S eye is
blazing and he looks back at Little Bill who is beginning to
act out the scene.

           LITTLE BILL
     Well, that bullet whizzin' by
     panicked Corky, an' he done the
     wrong thing!  Pulled his gun in
     such a damn hurry he shot off his
     own toe.  Meantime, Bob aims good
     and squeezes off another... but
     he's so drunk he misses again an'
     hits the thousand dollar mirror
     behind the bar.
     Well, now the Duck of Death is
     good as dead 'cause this time Corky
     does right an' aims real good, no
     hurry...

               WW
          (beside himself)
     And?

           LITTLE BILL
     Bam!  That Walker Colt blew up in
     his hand...  which was a failing
     common to that model.  Now if
     Corky would have really had two
     guns instead of just a big dick he
     could have defended himself to the
     end.

               WW
     You... you mean...
           (looking at Bob)
     English Bob killed him while...?

           LITTLE BILL
     Well he wasn't gonna wait for
     Corky to grow no new hand.  He
     walked over real close, bein'
     drunk, an' shot him through the
     liver.

WW stares first at English Bob and then at Little Bill,
appalled.


EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 42

Night in the woods and Ned fussing around with his blankets
not far from the campfire.

               NED
           (irritably)
     No sir, I did not give up robbin'
     an' stealin' on account of I got
     religion.  I give it up 'cause I
     got too old for all this here
     nature.

Munny is lying in his blankets a few feet away, exhausted
and dirty and not a bit interested in Ned's complaints.

           NED (cont'd)
     I give it up 'cause I hate
     sleepin' out in the air...
     fuckin' sticks in my food... an'
     fuckin' bugs in my food... an'
     fuckin' rocks under my back...
          (crawling into the
            blankets)
     Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin'
     bed.

              MUNNY
           (irritably)
     Yeah... you said that last night.

               NED
     Last night I said I missed my
     fuckin' wife...  tonight I just
     miss my fuckin' bed.

Lightning flashes and a horse whinnies and then the thunder
cracks and rolls.

              MUNNY
     Well, I guess you're gonna miss
     your fuckin' roof soon enough.


EXT. BY THE HORSES - NIGHT 43

The horses, shying and skittish, and The Kid is rubbing his
face tenderly on the Morgan and whispering in a soothing
voice.


EXT. CAMP - NIGHT 44

Munny and Ned lying near the campfire and The Kid walks up
and starts to fix his blankets.

He looks at Munny thoughtfully.  Something's bothering him,
and finally he blurts it out as he climbs into his own
blankets.

             THE KID
     Say, Bill.  That business in Jackson
     County... did that really happen?
     I mean how they say it happened?

              MUNNY
     What business?

             THE KID
          (a frown, a pause, then...)
     An' how there was two deputies up
     close pointin' rifles at you...
     had you dead to rights... an' how
     you pulled out a pistol an' blew
     them both away to hell...  an'
     only took a scratch yourself.
             (pause)
     Uncle Pete told me he never seen
     nothin' like it, shootin' your
     way out of a scrape like that.

              MUNNY
          (uncomfortable)
     Well... I don't recollect.

             THE KID
             (amazed and dubious)
     You don't recollect!

The Kid doesn't know whether he's been rebuffed or what, but
seeing after a moment that his conversation with Munny is
not getting anywhere he decides to have a try at Ned.

             THE KID
     Say, Ned... ?

               NED
              (curt)
     Yeah.

             THE KID
     How many men you killed?
          (after a long pause)
     Ain't you gonna answer?

               NED
     I don't like the question.

             THE KID
           (indignant)
     Well, I gotta know what kind of
     fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I?
     In case of a scrape.

               NED
     How many you killed, Kid?

             THE KID
     Five.  I killed five of 'em.
             (pause)
     That counts a Mexican I killed.
             (pause)
     He come at me with a knife.

There is a long pause and then a flash of lightning and a
roll of thunder and the nervous whinnies of the horses.

              MUNNY
     Get some sleep, Kid.

             THE KID
     You boys are crotchety as a
     couple of hens.

Just then the rain starts and it sizzles in the campfire and
the horses snort and Ned covers his head with his blankets.

               NED
     Aw shit!


INT. COUNTY OFFICE - NIGHT 45

               WW
     Actually, then, Mister Corcoran
     was faster on the draw than the
     D... English Bob?

WW is sitting at Little Bill's desk writing furiously with a
quill pen.  It is still night and Little Bill is lounging in
a chair and English Bob is moaning and snoring in the cell.

           LITTLE BILL
     Faster?  Fast was his mistake.  If
     he hadn't of been in such a
     goddamn hurry he would not have
     shot off his toe with his first
     shot and he would have killed old
     Bob.
           (lecturing)
     See, son, bein' a good shot an'
     bein' quick with a pistol... that
     don't do no harm... but it ain't
     much next to bein' cool.

Little Bill pulls out his pistol very deliberately... not
slowly, but not like a Hollywood fast draw.

          LITTLE BILL (cont'd)
     A man who will keep his head an'
     not get rattled under fire... he
     will kill you like as not.

Little Bill is pointing his pistol, aiming.

               WW
     But if the other fellow is quicker
     and fires first...

           LITTLE BILL
     He will be hurryin' and he will
     miss.  That there is as fast as I
     can pull an' aim an' hit anythin'
     more'n ten feet away... unless
     it's a barn.

               WW
     But... if he doesn't miss?

           LITTLE BILL
           (laughing and holstering
           his pistol)
     Then he will kill you.  That is
     why there are so few dangerous men
     like old Bob there... an' like me.
     It ain't so easy to shoot a man
     anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch
     is shootin' back at you... well,
     it'll unnerve most fellas.
             (struck with an idea)
     Look here, let me show you
     somethin'.
          (he reaches into a
          drawer in the desk
            and pulls out a pistol)
     See this here pistol?

WW looks at the pistol uneasily and over in the cell English
Bob's one eye opens and he moves his head slightly because
he senses something is happening.

Little Bill holds the pistols out to WW.

           LITTLE BILL
     Take it.
          (WW hesitates)
     Go on, take a hold.

Nervously WW accepts the gun as though it were hot.  Little
Bill pulls some keys out of a drawer and tosses them on the
desk.

           LITTLE BILL
     Them's the keys.  All you gotta do
     is shoot me an' you an' English
     Bob can ride out free as birds.

               WW
            (shaking)
     Is... is it... loaded?

           LITTLE BILL
     Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't.
     You got to cock it though.

WW looks nervously over at English Bob and Bob's eye says
"Do it, do it, do it."

WW gulps and he pulls back the hammer and stands up and
looks at Bob again and Bob is nodding "Yes, yes, do it."

           LITTLE BILL
     An' you got to point it.
             (pause)
     Go on, point it.

Slowly, with trembling hand WW raises the gun and points it
at Little Bill who looks calmly back at him.

           LITTLE BILL
     All you gotta do is pull on
     the trigger, mister.

WW gulps and sweat comes off his forehead and he points the
shaking gun and Bob nods "Yes" and WW bites his lip and
then...

WW lowers the gun slowly.  He can't do it.  He wipes his
forehead.

           LITTLE BILL
     Hot, ain't it?
            (reaching for the gun)
     You never even put your finger
     on the trigger.

Little Bill is reaching for the pistol but WW has a
frightening idea and instead of giving up the pistol he
steps backward toward the cell.

               WW
     What if... what if I gave it to...
     him.
            (and he indicates Bob)

Little Bill's eyes narrow like slits and tension fills the
air.

           LITTLE BILL
     Go ahead... give it to him.

English Bob's eye lights up in anticipation and he tries
to get up on one elbow.

               WW
            (gulping)
     R-r-r-really?  You r-r-really
     w-w-want...?

           LITTLE BILL
           (like ice)
     Give it to him.

English Bob is sitting up and reaching for the gun and his
eye is on Little Bill and WW reaches out with a shaking hand
and ENGLISH BOB'S hand just touches the gun and...

Little Bill drops his right hand to his own gun and grips
the butt and...

ENGLISH BOB hesitates, his gaze locked with LITTLE BILL'S
and the two men eye each other.  Then, furious, ENGLISH BOB
withdraws his hand... empty.

           LITTLE BILL
           (grinning)
     Guess he don't want it, Mister
     Beauchamp.

Little Bill accepts the pistol from the trembling WW and,
looking straight into ENGLISH BOB'S angry eye, LITTLE BILL
ejects five cartridges from the chambers of the pistol.

           LITTLE BILL
     You was right not to take it, Bob.
     I would of killed you.

WW collapses into a chair and wipes sweat from his brow.

            LITTLE BILL'S VOICE o.s.
     We could use some rain, eh, Mister
     Beauchamp?


EXT. CAMP - DAY 46

BARRRRROOM!  THUNDER, LIGHTNING, RAIN IN SHEETS and the
Albino mare rearing and screaming and Munny landing in the
mud.

              MUNNY
     You fucking no-good goddamn shit-
     faced pig fucking dirty whore.

It is daylight but the rain is so thick you can't see more
than five feet and Munny crawls up out of the mud wearing a
slicker and looking like hell, already full of remorse for
his outburst.

Ned rides up out of the rain leading Munny's horse and Munny
tries to mount again.

              MUNNY
     I didn't mean it, old gal.

The Albino rears but Ned is helping and he holds the horse
and then grabs the seat of Munny's muddy pants and half
shoves him into the saddle.

Up ahead, barely visible in the rain, The Kid is holding
back his horse impatiently.

             THE KID
     Let's go.


EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 47

A LITTLE LATER.  RAIN.  Ned and Munny riding side by side
through the downpour and The Kid twenty yards ahead, barely
visible.  Munny looks like shit and Ned looks at him with
concern, deliberates, then reaches into his saddle bag and
pulls out a bottle of whiskey and offers it.

               NED
     I brung this for when we had to
     kill them fellows.
             (Munny glances at it
          and looks away)
     I guess we could use some now.

              MUNNY
     Not for me.  I don't touch it no
     more.

               NED
          (exasperated)
     God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.

              MUNNY
     I know it's rainin',
          (looking ahead)
     Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?

Ned takes a long pull on the bottle, re-corks it and puts it
in his saddle bag.  He looks sympathetically at his friend
hunched unhappily in his saddle.

               NED
     You think the Kid really killed
     five men?

Munny just shrugs and looks back at the trail and keeps
riding.

              MUNNY
          (after a while)
     No.

               NED
     What he was talkin' about... how
     them deputies had the drop on you
     an' Pete...

              MUNNY
     Yeah?

               NED
     I remember how there was three of
     them deputies you shot... not two.

              MUNNY
          (dismissing it)
     Well, I ain't like that no more,
     Ned.  I ain't no crazy, killin'
     fool.

               NED
          (after a while)
     You still think it'll be easy
     shootin' them cowboys?

Munny shrugs and looks straight ahead into the rain.  Of
course, it won't be easy... and they both know it.

              MUNNY
     If we don't drown first.


EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 48

A blazing hot day and English Bob's battered face staring
out of the mud wagon which is being loaded up by Chandler.
In the distance the train whistle toots eagerly.

           LITTLE BILL
          (to Chandler)
     Give them keys to the conductor
     and tell him he can loose the
     cuffs off of Bob soon as he's out
     of the county.

Little Bill is standing beside the mud wagon and WW is
standing next to him and a little knot of onlookers forms a
semi circle.

           ENGLISH BOB
            (talking through closed
              teeth)
     Mmmm pistols.

           LITTLE BILL
     Oh yeah.

Little Bill unwraps a cloth and produces the ivory-handled
peacemakers... smashed and hopelessly bent.  And he gives
them to Bob and looks him in his one furious eye.

           LITTLE BILL
     I guess you know, Bob, how if I
     see you again I'll just start
     shootin' right off an' figure
     it's self-defense.

That's fine with English Bob.  He glares back and the two
men understand each other perfectly and then Chandler whips
the horses and the wagon starts to roll.

           LITTLE BILL
     I ain't stealin' your biographer,
     Bob.  Stayin' on was his idea.

And WW stands there beside Little Bill and gives Bob a shit-
eating look and English Bob just glares and rolls away.


EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER 49

As the mud wagon rattles down the dusty street English Bob
sticks his horrid swollen face out the window and screams
insanely:

           ENGLISH BOB
     A plague on you!  A plague on the
     whole stinking lot of you!  You're
     uncivilized vermin, without laws
     or morals!  You're worthless
     savages!  I curse you!  You're
     cursed!  Cursed!

The whores, fanning themselves on Greeley's porch, stare
dumbfounded as the madman rolls by raving.  Then he's gone.
All that remains is the sound of his ranting, diminishing in
the distance and a cloud of dust settling on the hot street.

Sitting next to Faith on the porch, Alice fans herself
grimly.

              ALICE
     Nobody's gonna come.

              FAITH
     Huh?

              ALICE
     After what Little Bill done to
     the Englishman.

Skinny steps out the door and blinks in the dazzling light
and wipes his face.

              SKINNY
     Delilah, them tables ain't clean.
     Can't you get 'em clean?

Delilah gets up and goes in, angrily brushing past Skinny in
the doorway.

              SKINNY
           (after her)
     Well, if you'd cover up your face,
     maybe somebody'd want to fuck with
     you an' you wouldn't have to do
     all the cleanin'.
          (to the others)
     Whaddaya call them things that
     cover the face?

              FAITH
            (looking straight ahead)
     A veil.

              SKINNY
     Yeah, a veil.  Christ it's hot.

There is a distant roll of thunder and Skinny looks off at
the Southern horizon where storm clouds are gathering.

              ALICE
           (listlessly)
     Rain's coming.

              SKINNY
          (emphatically)
     Thank God.


EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY 50

THUNDER AND LIGHTNING and the train chugging through the
storm.  A second flash of lightning reveals three drenched
riders near the tracks and one of them is having trouble
controlling his white horse.

Of course it is Munny and as he tries to hold the shying
mare a flash of lightning lights up a passing railroad coach
and Munny gets just a glimpse of a strange battered face in
the window.

The Kid is handing the whiskey bottle back to Ned and Ned
offers it to Munny again.

               NED
     You sure, Bill?

And Munny just shakes his head and wipes rain from his eyes.


EXT. SOUTH ROAD - NIGHT 51

NIGHT AND RAIN and The Kid is chuckling drunkenly and
handing the bottle back to Ned who looks at it and tilts it
way back.  They are riding along the South road in the dark.

             THE KID
          (cheerfully)
     I left you some... about a drop.

Munny is hunched in his saddle, shivering, his teeth
chattering.

               NED
     You alright, Bill?

Munny doesn't look alright.  He looks like shit... looks
sick.  He doesn't answer and Ned looks worried and takes the
last drops from the bottle and tosses it in the road near
the ordinance sign which is too dark to read.


INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 52

Alice's room at night, the sound of rain beating hard on the
roof.  Alice is playing cards with Silky and Faith when
Little Sue sticks her head in the door.

            LITTLE SUE
     A fella's askin' for you, Alice.

              ALICE
     Tonight?  You ain't joshin'?

            LITTLE SUE
          (looking behind her)
     This way, mister.

Silky and Faith pick up the cards to leave.

              ALICE
     Must be randy as hell to come
     out in this shit.

And then they look up because a water soaked young man with
very few front teeth and a ragged stubble is standing in the
doorway squinting.  It is the Kid.


INT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE - DAY 53

DRIP DRIP DRIP.  A chamber pot on the floor of Little Bill's
house collecting water from a leak in the roof and Little
Bill is walking about in stocking feet, making a speech.

           LITTLE BILL
     "No," he says, "you are wrong
     Little Bill.  That there is no
     Curly J but a bobbed J."  He
     had worked it over, you see?

WW Beauchamp is sitting in a chair scratching frantic notes
with a quill pen... and a splotch of water hits the paper
and he glances up because there is a new leak.

           LITTLE BILL
            (continuing, oblivious)
     "Jim," I says, "You are a liar and
     a horsethief."  Now -- when he
     seen them others wasn't gonna help
     him none -- he started in to
     cryin' and sobbin' and sayin'...
           (mimicking)
     "Don't kill me, Little Bill,
     don't kill me, please don't
     kill me."

WW is trying to write and trying to slide away from the leak
without interrupting Little Bill who is delighting in his
own narration, oblivious to the new leak.

           LITTLE BILL
          (in his own voice)
     "Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me
     sick to see a man struttin' around
     and packin' two pistols an' a Henry
     rifle and cryin' like a baby."

               WW
     Did you... kill him?

           LITTLE BILL
     No,... but I can't abide them
     kind... an' you will find a lot of
     them in the saloons... tramps an'
     drunk teamsters an' crazy
     miners... sportin' pistols like
     they was bad men, but not having
     no sand nor character... not even
     bad character.

WW is really getting wet and he is moving the chair.

           LITTLE BILL
           (on his own wave
             length)
     I do not like assassins an' men
     of low character like your friend
     English Bob... but Bob ain't no
     coward who will cry to your face
     an' then...

               WW
     Uh... Sheriff... Uh...

           LITTLE BILL
     Huh?  Oh.
          (looking up sadly)
     Another one, huh?  Shit, I guess
     I'm clean out of receptacles.

               WW
          (trying a joke with
             effort)
     Maybe you should... hang the
     carpenter.

           LITTLE BILL
          (jaw dropping)
     What?

               WW
            (uneasy)
     Uh... hang the... uh...
     carpenter.  I...

There is a sudden loud knocking on the door and Bill turns
and goes to the door.

           LITTLE BILL
     On a night like this?  What
     the hell?

Opening the door he reveals Charlie Hecker, wearing a
slicker and shedding water like a waterfall.

             CHARLEY
     Three seedy lookin' fellas come
     inta town, Bill.  They're down
     to Greely's an' at least two of
     'em got guns.


INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT 54

CLOSE on the whiskey bottle and Ned is pouring the bright
liquid into his glass and Munny is mesmerized by the
dazzling highlights.  The two of them are sitting at a table
in Greely's smokey, dimly lit bar room and the rain is
beating on the roof and there is a checker game at a table
fifteen feet away attended by Germany Joe Schultz, Tom
Luckinbill, a farmer, Eggs Anderson, the local restauranteur
and Paddy McGee the cooper.  All of them are sneaking
occasional, furtive glances at the strangers, as is Fatty
who is talking to Skinny at the bar.

               NED
     ...in hell's takin' The Kid so
     long?  You suppose he...
          (seeing Munny)
     Jesus, Bill you look like shit.

Munny looks dazed and shakes his head to clear it.

              MUNNY
     You... you remember Eagle
     Hendershot?

               NED
            (startled)
     Huh?  Uh... yeah.

              MUNNY
     I seen him.

               NED
     He's dead, Bill.

              MUNNY
     His head was all busted open
     so's you could see the inside.

               NED
     Jesus, Bill, you got fever.
     Take a drink, will you?

              MUNNY
          (ignoring Ned)
     Worms was comin' out.

               NED
          (getting up)
     Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's
     takin' The Kid so long.  Must be
     he's gettin' an advance offa them
     sportin' ladies.

Ned starts for the back room, then stops and goes back.

               NED
     Say, Bill... If I was to... take
     a little while myself... I guess
     you... I guess you...  I guess
     you don't want to come?

Munny shakes his head "no" and, as Ned departs for the
Billiard Room, Munny stares vacantly at the whiskey bottle.

           LITTLE BILL'S VOICE o.s.
     ... me your pistol, mister.

              MUNNY
            (looking up, startled)
     Huh?

The big man in the dripping slicker is standing only ten
feet away... Little Bill.  And Little Bill is looking at
him.  Munny can feel everybody in the room staring at him.

           LITTLE BILL
     I says, "You'll want to give
     over your pistol."

Munny can see Charley moving slowly along the wall on the
left for position... and Fatty is over on the right, Skinny
beside him... and WW is by the door shifting nervously and
the checker players are frozen in their seats and Munny can
feel them all... watching him.

              MUNNY
     Uh, no.  No, I ain't drunk.

           LITTLE BILL
           (almost friendly)
     Ordinance says you got to turn in
     your firearms to the County
     office day or night. I guess you
     didn't read it with the weather
     an' all.

              MUNNY
           (nervously)
     Well... uh... I... I ain't got
     no, uh, firearms.

           LITTLE BILL
            (not friendly any more)
     Them friends of yours in the
     back, they carryin' pistols?

              MUNNY
     I... dunno.  I mean, I guess not.
     No, they ain't carryin' no guns.

           LITTLE BILL
     You're spillin' your whiskey,
     mister.

              MUNNY
     Like I said, I...

           LITTLE BILL
     What's your name?

              MUNNY
     Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.

Little Sue looks timidly in from the Billiard Room, bites
her lip, and retreats quickly.

           LITTLE BILL
     Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was
     to call you a no good sonofabitch
     an' a liar, an' if I was to say
     you shit in your pants on account
     of a cowardly soul... well, I
     guess then, you would show me your
     pistol right quick an' shoot me
     dead, ain't that so?

              MUNNY
            (trapped)
     I... I guess I might... but like
     I said, I ain't armed.

Little Bill pulls out his pistol and points it at Munny and
makes a little motion with the barrel that means "get up"
and Munny gets up.

Little Bill steps close to him and reaches out with his left
hand and opens Munny's coat revealing the Starr tucked in
his belt.

           LITTLE BILL
     I guess you just carry it for
     snakes an' such.

              MUNNY
     Uh... yeah.  Yeah.

           LITTLE BILL
             (cold)
     There ain't no snakes in here,
     Mister Hendershot.

              MUNNY
     Well, uh... it ain't loaded.

Little Bill takes the pistol out of Munny's belt and slowly
and deliberately ejects five cartridges and he looks at
Munny who is sweating and Munny just wants a way out.

              MUNNY
     Well, the powder's wet an...

WHACK!  Little Bill brings the muzzle of the gun across
Munny's temple and blood flows and Munny goes to one knee
and Little Bill kicks him hard, WHUMP!

           LITTLE BILL
          (turning to WW)
     Mister Beauchamp, this here is
     the sort of trash I was speakin'
     of.

Munny is struggling to his feet and staggering weak-kneed to
the table where he grabs the whiskey bottle and breaks it
off and turns groggily to face Little Bill.

Little Bill, unperturbed, advances on him and when Munny
strikes desperately with the bottle, Little Bill blocks his
blow easily and slams him hard with the muzzle of the pistol
and Munny goes down again.

           LITTLE BILL
             (to WW)
     You will find these kind in the
     saloons of your prosperous
     communities.
            (WHUMP, he kicks Munny)
     But you will not find none of
     them in Big Whiskey.

Munny is on the floor on all fours, trying gamely to get up.


EXT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 55

Ned pushing The Kid out the window of Alice's room and The
Kid isn't fully dressed and neither is Ned but he pushes him
frantically into the rainy night anyway and Alice is urging
them on and Little Sue looks ready to wet her pants.

              ALICE
            (to Ned)
     Hurry.
          (to Little Sue)
     You know what to say to Little Bill?

Little Sue nods "yes" but she is speechless with terror and
Alice hands Ned's boots out the window to him.


EXT. ALICE'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Outside the window, NIGHT, RAIN, and Ned and The Kid trying
to get dressed in the mud and Alice sticks her head out the
window.

              ALICE
     You got to look sharp for that
     old oak.  You miss the oak an'
     you ain't gonna find it.

               NED
          (to The Kid)
     Never mind your shirt, get them
     boots on.

Ned is trying to get his own boots on and he goes down on
his ass in the mud.

              ALICE
     The roof ain't much but...

             THE KID
     What about Bill?  What we gonna
     do about...

               NED
     Come on, Kid.  I hope them horses
     is still there.


INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT 56

Munny crawling along the floor of the bar room, covered with
blood, heading for the door.

           LITTLE BILL
     Let the man out, WW.  He is
     desiring to leave the hospitality
     of Big Whiskey behind him.

Munny is crawling past WW's legs and WW looks down at the
miserable semi-conscious creature and he sees clearly the
left hand and the three fingers as they fight for traction
and then WW steps to the door and opens it and Munny crawls
into the rain and the night.


INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 57

SLAP!  Alice gets Little Bill's big hand across the face.

             SKINNY
     Easy, Little Bill, she's gotta
     work, she's gotta turn a dollar
     a time.

Little Bill glares at Skinny.  They are in Alice's room and
Charley is there and Little Sue and WW and it is pretty
crowded.

           LITTLE BILL
            (to Alice)
     If they was just here for the
     fuckin', how come they lit out
     the back window?

              ALICE
            (defiant)
     On account of they seen you was
     beatin' on their friend.

            LITTLE SUE
            (bravely)
     Th-th-they just c-c-come for the
     b-b-billiards, Little Bill, honest.

           LITTLE BILL
            (snorting)
     Billiards!
          (to Little Sue)
     An' they was just passin' through?

            LITTLE SUE
     Th-th-they was g-g-goin to F-f-fort
     B-b-buford t-t-to...

              ALICE
             (nasty)
     You just kicked the shit out of
     a innocent man, you big asshole.

           LITTLE BILL
     Innocent of what?


EXT. SOUTH END OF TOWN - NIGHT 58

The south end of town, NIGHT, RAIN and the Albino mare
walking aimlessly with Munny slumped in the saddle and then
two riders come from between two shadowy buildings and it is
The Kid and Ned and they come alongside Munny, one on each
side of him and Ned lifts his slumped head up and looks at
the battered face and winces and says with his eyes what The
Kid says with his tongue.

             THE KID
     Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.


INT. SHED - NIGHT 59

CANDLELIGHT, Ned and The Kid, and Ned is sewing Munny's face
with a needle and thread.

               NED
     Hold him, dammit.

It is some sort of straw-filled shed and they have stuck a
candle on a board.

             THE KID
            (sickened)
     Jesus.
             (pause)
     You done this before?

               NED
            (working)
     Plenty of times.

Munny is only semi-conscious and The Kid is holding his face
still.

             THE KID
     His pistol must of jammed.

               NED
     Move the candle closer, I can't see.

             THE KID
     He wouldn't of took no beating like
     that if it hadn't of jammed.  He
     wouldn't just give it over an' not
     shoot no one.


INT. SHED - DAY 60

DAYLIGHT in the shed and Munny's face, waxy yellow, crude
stitching, hideous swelling eyes vacant, breathing heavy.

He is lying in the straw and The Kid is looking down at him
with distaste.  The Kid is only partly dressed.

             THE KID
     He don't look so good.

The sound of the rain is different: it's still coming but it
isn't a storm any more.  The shed is an irregular shelter
because one wall and various parts of the roof have
collapsed and the woods outside are clearly visible.

Silky is sitting on some straw straightening her clothes and
Ned and Alice are climbing out of a corner where they have
obviously been at it and are in various states of dress.

             THE KID
            (to Alice)
     He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?

               NED
           (irritated)
     He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

             THE KID
     Well, I guess I woulda at least
     pulled my pistol an...

               NED
     Shit, Kid, you pulled your
     pistol... right outta the lady
     an' out the back window.

             THE KID
     That was your idea, I wanted to...

              SILKY
            (getting up and smooth-
           ing herself)
     We gotta go.

             THE KID
     Huh?  Already?  Hey, I'm near
     ready for another advance.

              SILKY
     You're gonna use it all up before
     you get it.

              ALICE
          (about to leave)
     No more advances on what you
     ain't done yet.

             THE KID
     Well, we're just waitin' on the
     weather.  If the weather breaks
     tomorrow we could...

               NED
            (to Alice)
     We're gonna need more food... at
     least three days worth...

             THE KID
     Three days?  We could kill 'em
     tomorrow.

               NED
          (a sharp look at
             The Kid)
     I don't kill nobody without him.
           (indicating Munny)

             THE KID
           (frustrated)
     We don't need him.  The two of
     us could do it.

The horses are partly under the roof and Alice and Silky are
leading theirs out and nobody is paying attention to The
Kid.

             THE KID
           (petulantly)
     He ain't nothin' but a broken
     down pig farmer.

              ALICE
             (mounting her horse,
             to Ned)
     One of us'll bring food in the
     morning.  I guess you'll want
     some whiskey.

               NED
     An' medicine if you got it...

The Kid walks over to the edge of the broken wall and from
the other corner Munny moans loudly and then screams.

              MUNNY
     Ohhhhh, ooohhhh no.  No, I
     didn't do nothin'.

Ned hurries over to Munny and The Kid is left there with the
two Whores who are both mounted now and The Kid is
embarrassed.

             THE KID
     Don't it make you sick, hearin'
     him like that?
            (The Whores turn their
             horses)
     Don't you ladies worry none...
     Me an' Ned, we'll kill those
     two fuckers.

And The Kid has picked up two pieces of paper that the
whores gave them earlier and they are charcoal sketches, one
of Davey Bunting and the other of Quick Mike and they are
pretty fair likenesses.


INT. SHED - NIGHT 61

CLOSE on a lantern hanging from a beam in the shed and it is
night again and the rain has stopped though you can still
hear water dripping from the eaves.

             THE KID
     It was a lot of shit what my
     uncle told me, huh?

They are playing cards on the straw floor, Ned and The Kid
and Ned doesn't look up from his cards.

               NED
     Depends what he told you.
             (pause)
     About Bill, you mean?

             THE KID
     All of it.  About him, an' you
     an' Uncle Pete... about robbin'
     the Rock Island Pacific... an'
     about them Missouri Banks.

               NED
     We done that stuff.

             THE KID
     Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't
     no fearless killer an' bank
     robber like he said.

In the other corner of the room Munny gives a loud moan and
both men look at him and then back to their cards.

               NED
     Kid, it ain't gonna mean nothin'
     to you, but the roof I built on
     my house, it don't have a leak
     in it... not one.
           (The Kid looks perplexed)
     Most folks think a school house
     is the first sign of civilizin'...
     but I say it's a good roof.

Well, that amazes The Kid, being stuck here with these train
robber-bad men and now this shit about roofs and he just
stares.

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Claudia... No... Oh, Jesus,
     Claudia, ohh...

Ned gets up and takes the lantern over to where Munny is
lying and kneels beside him.  Munny looks ghastly, at
death's door.

               NED
     Claudia... ain't here, Bill.

              MUNNY
            (reaching)
     Ned... Is that you, Ned?
          (holding Ned's arm)
     Ned, I seen... death.

               NED
     Easy, Bill.

              MUNNY
     I seen the angel of death Ned,
     an' I seen the river.
            (panicked)
     He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.

               NED
     Who, Bill?  Who got snake eyes?

              MUNNY
     The angel... the angel of death.
     I'm scared, Ned.  Ned, I'm gonna
     die.

               NED
     Easy, Bill, easy.

The Kid has walked over and is watching and it fascinates
and scares him and he watches and swallows hard.

              MUNNY
     I seen her... I seen Claudia too...

               NED
            (soothing)
     Well, that's good now, ain't
     it, Bill?  Seein' Claudia an...?

              MUNNY
     She was all covered with worms.
     Oh, Ned, I'm scared of dyin'...

The Kid can't takes any more and he turns and walks away and
Ned tries to comfort Munny and Munny grabs him and pulls him
close.

              MUNNY
     Ned... don't tell nobody... don't
     tell the kids... don't tell 'em
     none of... none of the things I
     done.

And Ned has tears in his eyes and Munny's eyes are staring
and he is seeing something horrible and we


EXT. SHED - DAY 62

A VISION, DAYLIGHT and the horse horribly bloody, screaming
silently in agony while the sound is the sound of night and
the shed and the rain dripping but that doesn't diminish the
agony of the bloody animal as the whip falls on the head and
the eyes and we see the YOUNG MAN cruelly wielding the whip.

It is Munny fifteen years earlier and it is a picture of
unbelievable cruelty and viciousness... because that is what
he was like and what he remembers.


INT. SHED - NIGHT 63

NIGHT in the shed, a little moonlight coming in through the
open wall.  The lantern is out and the sound is the sound of
Munny's labored breathing and Ned and The Kid are in their
blankets.

             THE KID
     He's gonna die, ain't he?

               NED
     Maybe.

             THE KID
     Well, suppose he does?

               NED
          (after a pause)
     We'll bury him.

             THE KID
     That ain't what I mean.

               NED
     You mean, am I gonna help you
     kill them cowboys?

             THE KID
     I can't spot 'em myself but you
     could.  That red-haired one, you
     could spot a half-mile off, I bet.

               NED
     An' if I spot 'em?

             THE KID
     I'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!

               NED
     Just like that?

             THE KID
     I told you I'm a damn killer.
     I done it before.
             (pause, you can hear
           Munny breathing)
     I'm more killer than him.

               NED
     Yeah?

             THE KID
     Hell, yeah.


INT. SHED - DAY 64

DAYLIGHT and the cut-whore's face.  Delilah is leaning over
Munny wiping his brow.  He is lying in the straw looking up
at her and he looks like shit... his face ghastly pale and
stubbled and covered with horrible cuts and bad stitching...
but his eyes are clear.

              MUNNY
     I thought... you was an angel.

             DELILAH
           (embarrassed, getting up)
     You ain't dead.

Delilah goes over to her horse and gets some packages out of
the saddle bags.  Munny tries to sit up weakly.

              MUNNY
     Some big guy beat the shit out
     of me.
            (feeling his sore face)
     I guess I must look a lot like
     you, huh?

             DELILAH
          (angry, hurt)
     You don't look nothin' like me,
     mister.

              MUNNY
     I didn't mean no offense.
          (she doesn't answer)
     I guess you're the one them
     cowboys cut up.
           (no answer)
     Ned an' The Kid, my partners,
     are they... ?

             DELILAH
             (coldly)
     They went out scouting when they
     saw your fever broke.

              MUNNY
     Scouting?

             DELILAH
     On the Bar T... looking for... them.

              MUNNY
     Oh.  How long I been here?

             DELILAH
           (still cold)
     Three days.  Are you hungry?

              MUNNY
     Three days?  I must be.


EXT. WOODS NEAR SHED - DAY 65

CLOSE on robins, four of them in the woods near the shed and
Munny is watching them where he sits wolfing chicken
hungrily, his back against the shed.  Delilah is watching
him eat.

              MUNNY
     I thought I was gone.  See them
     birds?  Most times I wouldn't
     even notice them birds much.  But
     I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause
     I thought I was dead.

             DELILAH
     I brought your hat.  You... left
     it down at Greely's.

              MUNNY
     That big guy lookin' for me?

As he looks over at her Munny's eye falls briefly on her
exposed ankle and Delilah feels the look.

             DELILAH
     Little Bill?  He thinks you
     went North.

Munny can't help it and his eye flicks back to the ankle.

             DELILAH
     Are you really going to kill
     them?

              MUNNY
          (unenthusiastically)
     Yeah, I guess.
            (suddenly)
     There's still a payment, ain't
     there?

She nods and she moves so that more ankle is showing, but
Munny's eye is drawn to her breasts as she moves, then he
looks away quickly, guiltily and they sit there silently
until...

             DELILAH
     Them other two, they been takin'
     advances on the payment.

              MUNNY
     Advances?

He can't help looking at her body and she knows it.

             DELILAH
             (shyly)
     Free ones.

Her body is getting to him.

              MUNNY
            (stupidly)
     Free ones?

             DELILAH
     Alice an' Silky gave them...
     free ones.

              MUNNY
          (understanding,
           embarrassed)
     Oh.  Yeah.

             DELILAH
           (shy, timid)
     You want... a free one.

              MUNNY
          (looking away,
           embarrassed)
     Me?  No.  No, I guess not.

And Delilah is hurt... crushed.  She gets up and covers it
by picking up the remains of the chicken and Munny is too
embarrassed to look at her.

             DELILAH
          (covering her hurt)
     I didn't mean... with me.  Alice
     and Silky, they'll give you
     one... if you want.

              MUNNY
     I... I guess not.
             (unusually perceptive
            suddenly)
     I didn't mean I didn't want one
     'cause of you bein' cut up.  I
     didn't mean that.

Delilah keeps her back to him.

              MUNNY
           (trying to get up)
     It ain't that at all.  You're a
     beautiful woman.  What I said
     before, how I might look like you
     ... I didn't mean you was ugly
     like me, hell no... I only meant
     how we both had scars.

He is standing weakly, supporting himself on the wall and
his speech is so sincere and Delilah wants to believe it.

              MUNNY
     You're a beautiful woman an'...
     if I was to want a free one, I
     guess I'd want you more than them
     others.  It ain't... See... I
     can't have no free one on account
     of my wife...

             DELILAH
     Your wife?

              MUNNY
     Yeah.  See?

             DELILAH
          (after a pause)
     I admire that, you being true to
     your wife.  I've seen a lot of...
     of men... who weren't.

              MUNNY
           (pleased and embarrassed)
     Yeah, I guess.

             DELILAH
     She back in Kansas?

              MUNNY
     Uh... yeah.  Yeah.  She's uh...
     watchin' over the little ones.

And Munny gives her what for him is his best social smile...
sort of like a pig strangling.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 66

VIEW on the BAWLING CALF and the red hot iron coming out of
the fire.  It is midday in the box canyon and the four
cowboys, Texas Slim, Johnny Foley, Lippy Macgregor and Davey
Bunting are branding strays and Johnny has the calf down
ready for the pigging string but the calf kicks loose and
knocks Johnny into the fire and the other three cowboys are
guffawing, their sweaty faces full of the camaraderie of
hardworking men who might get irritable by the end of the
day but not yet.  And then like a flash, still laughing,
young Davey is on his paint and riding like hell after the
stray and it is beautiful to watch because he and the paint
are like one.

CRACK!  A rifle shot and the pony does a violent somersault
and Davey goes over in a spray of dirt and fifty yards away
Texas Slim, Lippy and Johnny stare in frozen horror.

The downed pony spurts blood from his nostrils, and Davey's
right leg is pinned under the dying paint's flank and they
are maybe fifteen yards from the edge of the canyon and
Davey's first thought is the pony.

              DAVEY
     Oh, Jesus, fella...
            (shouting)
     Boys, my pony's hurt...

And turning he sees the three cowboys standing fifty yards
away, frozen in their tracks.

              DAVEY
     Boys...

And they suddenly turn and run away toward some rocks and it
is only then that the terror hits Davey and in a sudden
panic he tries to get free of the horse.

              DAVEY
     Oh, Jesus, boys, my leg's broke.
     I'm pinned, boys.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 67

VIEW on Ned, his face covered with sweat, the Spencer
against his cheek and he is crouched among some boulders up
the canyon wall about three hundred yards from Davey and
Munny is looking over Ned's shoulder and The Kid is trying
to see, too, squinting desperately, but he can't see shit.

              MUNNY
     Finish him, Ned.

             THE KID
     He ain't dead?  You didn't get him?

              MUNNY
     (to the Kid, without turning)
     He got the boy's horse.

Looking down the barrel of the rifle Ned can see Davey
struggling frantically to get free of the horse and it is an
easy shot and Ned is sweating, his hand is shaking and he
can hear Munny's voice.

          MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Better get him 'fore he gets
     clear of the horse, Ned.

And Ned is shaking and CRACK, he fires.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 68

VIEW on Davey and dust kicking up a foot away and the extra
terror gives him the strength to pull free of the horse.

          JOHNNY'S VOICE o.s.
          (distant, shouting)
     Assassin assholes.  You dirty asshole
     sonsabitches.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 69

Munny and Ned and The Kid and Ned is shaking.

             THE KID
     Did you kill him?

              MUNNY
     He's clear of the horse, Ned.
     Better get him.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 70

VIEW on Davey and he is crawling clear of the horse but his
leg is broken and it's hard and he looks toward the rocks
where his friends are hiding sixty yards away.

           TEXAS SLIM'S VOICE
           (from behind rock)
     Behind you, Davey.  Go for them
     rocks behind you.

And turning, Davey can see a couple of boulders only fifteen
yards away that will provide cover.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 71

Ned aiming and shaking.

             THE KID
     What happened?  He ain't dead?
     What's goin' on?

              MUNNY
             (to Ned)
     If he gets behind them rocks we
     ain't gonna get him... not
     without we go down there.

             THE KID
     What rocks?  Why don't you shoot?
     What's goin' on?

          JOHNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Fuckin' bushwhackin' assholes.

And looking down the barrel Ned can see Davey crawling for
the rocks and it is an easy shot and he can't do it and he
looks up at Munny and the agony in his eyes says it all.

             THE KID
     Ain't you gonna shoot?  Is he
     dead?

Munny grabs the rifle and Ned moves aside and slumps against
a rock and Munny looks down the barrel and aims.

              MUNNY
     I ain't much of a shot.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 72

Davey crawling and CRACK!  The dust kicks up eight feet
away.  He is ten yards from the boulders and it is agony to
crawl.

           LIPPY'S VOICE o.s.
     Keep goin', Davey boy.

CRACK!  Dust puffs up three feet from Davey's head.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 73

Munny, the rifle at his cheek and The Kid leaning
frantically over his shoulder, trying to see.

              MUNNY
     Shit!

             THE KID
     What happened, did you hit him?

BANG!  BANG!  Pistol shots from below and the bullets
ping harmlessly among the rocks.

             THE KID
     They're shootin' at us.

          JOHNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     We'll kill you, you assholes.

Munny is aiming, he can see Davey, nearer shelter now.
CRACK!  He fires and sees the dust spurt near Davey.

           LIPPY'S VOICE o.s.
     You assholes... you stinking
     ambushing assholes.

             THE KID
     Did you get him?  Where is he?


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 74

Davey crawling frantically and CRACK!... dust explodes only
inches from his head and he is pulling himself frantically
and he is only three yards from safety.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 75

CLOSE on Munny and he is sweating.

              MUNNY
     How many shots I got, Ned?

Ned is sitting there dazed, staring vacantly.  BANG, BANG,
BANG, return fire pings off the rocks.

              MUNNY
             (aiming)
     HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?

               NED
     Two.

And looking down the rifle Munny can see Davey's head
disappear behind the boulder and CRACK, Munny fires again.

             THE KID
     Did you get him?

BANG BANG BANG the pistol fire.

            TEXAS SLIM'S VOICE o.s.
     Keep goin', Davey.

Munny is cocking and aiming for his last shot and he can see
Davey's legs sticking out from the rock and they're not
moving.

             THE KID
     Tell me... Christ...

          JOHNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     ...murderin' bastards...

          LIPPY'S VOICE o.s.
     ...fuckin' skunks...

CRACK, Munny fires.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 76

VIEW ON dust puffing as Davey's legs disappear behind the
boulder, and there is a low groan.


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 77

VIEW on Munnt sitting back against the rock, exhausted,
covered with sweat and he holds the rifle up to The Kid.

              MUNNY
     Better re-load it.

             THE KID
     You missed him?  You didn't...?

              MUNNY
     I got him.

           DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
          (scared, hurt)
     Jesus, boys, I'm shot... they
     shot me...

            TEXAS SLIM'S VOICE o.s.
     You tramps... you murderin' tramps.

             THE KID
             (shaken)
     He ain't killed.

              MUNNY
           (washed out)
     Maybe, maybe not.  Got him in
     the gut, I think.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 78

Davey lying behind the boulder and the whole front of him is
soaking in bright red blood and the sun is beating down.

              DAVEY
     Oh Jesus... I'm hurt... I'm
     hurt.  They shot me...


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 79

Munny sitting there, his back against the rock, staring
vacantly and Ned looks the same.

             THE KID
           (derisively)
     Them assholes can't hit us up
     here.  Just wastin' bullets.

The cowboys must realize that because they stop shooting and
you can hear Davey moaning and Ned and Munny just sit there
and sweat and The Kid is pacing up and down.

             THE KID
     You think he's gonna die?  You
     think we killed him?

Ned and Munny look into each other's eyes.

           DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
     Help me, boys, help me...

              MUNNY
             (flatly)
     Yup... we killed him, I guess.

           DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
     Oh, Jesus, help me boys, I don't
     want to die... I don't want to die.

             THE KID
          (rattled, shouting)
     SHOULDN'T OF CUT UP NO WOMAN,
     YOU ASSHOLE.


EXT. BOX CANYON - DAY 80

Davey is lying there behind the boulder drenched in blood,
looking up at the blazing noonday sun.

              DAVEY
            (shouting)
     I'M DYIN', BOYS.

He pauses then, and then he speaks in a normal voice, as
though to himself, to express his amazement, to test
reality.

              DAVEY
     I'm dyin'.
             (pause)
     I'm dyin'.
          (shouting, panicked)
     BOYS, I'M DYIN'!


EXT. BOULDERS - DAY 81

Munny sweating and looking up at the sun, and Ned staring
vacantly.

           DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
     I'm thirsty, Slim, Jesus, I'm
     thirsty.
             (pause)
     Bring me a drink won't you, Slim?
     One drink, Slim... I'm dyin', Slim...
             (pause)
     Boys, bring me a drink.

it is getting to all three of them and Munny looks up at the
sun and then Ned gets up and he walks over to a rock and he
vomits.

          DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
     One drink... please, boys...
     just one d...

              MUNNY
             (leaping up, shouting)
     BRING HIM SOME GODDAMN WATER,
     YOU ASSHOLES.

THE BOULDERS.  Nothing happens, you can't tell if the
cowboys are behind there or not.

           DAVEY'S VOICE o.s.
     Please boys... I'm shot in the
     gut... I'm bleedin'... bring me...

              MUNNY
            (shouting)
     WILL YOU TAKE HIM A FUCKING DRINK
     FOR CHRIST SAKE!  WE AIN'T GONNA
     SHOOT.

There is a pause and Munny looks down at the boulders where
the cowboys are hiding.

           TEXAS SLIM'S VOICE
            (from behind the boulder)
     You ain't gonna shoot?

              MUNNY
     No.

And then, after a long moment, Munny sees Texas Slim come
out from behind the boulder and run nervously toward the
rock where Davey lies and he is carrying a canteen.

          JOHNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Don't you shoot him, you assholes.

The Kid is trying to see but of course he can't.

             THE KID
     They takin' water?

              MUNNY
     Yeah.

Munny is watching and he sees Texas Slim disappear behind
the boulder where Davey is lying and there is a moment of
silence... and then the voice, a scream of grief and
anguish...

           TEXAS SLIM'S VOICE
            (from behind the boulder)
     Oh, Jesus, Johnny, they've killed
     him... they've shot up his gut...
     oh Jesus, they've killed young
     Davey... oh, those murderin'
     bastards, they've killed our
     Davey...

And The Kid spits in the dust and Ned wipes his forehead
with his bandanna and Munny scuffs the dirt with his boot.


HOOVES ON FLAT ROCK and the three riders, Munny, Ned and The
Kid, are trotting their horses over a smooth slab of rock
near a hill.  They are silent, glum, then,

             THE KID
     When we gonna double back?

              MUNNY
     After a ways.

               NED
             (not looking at them)
     Not me.

Munny looks up sharply but Ned just looks straight ahead.

               NED
     I'm goin' on down to Kansas.

              MUNNY
     We got to kill this other one
     first.
          (Ned doesn't answer)
     Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we
     could kill him by nightfall...
     or maybe tomorrow morning.
     Then we could head back, all
     three of us, with the money.

Ned reins in his horse and Munny pulls up too and then The
Kid.

               NED
          (looking him in
             the eye)
     You want the Spencer, Bill?
           (he holds out the rifle)

              MUNNY
             (lamely)
     Shit, Ned, this ain't the time
     to quit.

             THE KID
     You're gonna lose your share.
     If you don't...

              MUNNY
     Shut up, Kid.

Ned just holds out the rifle and after a moment Munny takes
it and Ned takes a box of cartridges from his pocket and
hands them over.

               NED
     I'll see you, Bill.  See you, Kid.

And he turns his horse and heads off across open country at
a trot and Munny watches him go till he's about fifty yards
away.

              MUNNY
            (shouting)
     HOLD ON, NED.

And Ned reins up and Munny gallops up to him and holds out
the Spencer and the bullets.

              MUNNY
     I ain't worth a shit with it.

Ned takes the rifle, sheathes it, gives a curt nod and turns
to go.

              MUNNY
     Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to
     the ranch an' as soon as we find
     him, we'll shoot him.  Then we'll
     come back an' the three of us pick
     up the money an' head South
     together.

               NED
     Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?

              MUNNY
     I'll bet anything he won't go to
     town nor he won't ride out on the
     range.  Right off he'll hole up at
     the ranch.

               NED
          (turning away)
     I ain't waitin', Bill.
          (looking back)
     I'll look in on your youngsters
     when I get back.

              MUNNY
          (calling after him)
     Ned, don't pay no mind to what the
     Kid said about the money.  I'll
     bring your share along, hear?  The
     Kid's full of shit, hear?


EXT. LITTLE BILL'S HOUSE - DAY 82

VIEW on the roof, late afternoon, and Little Bill is
crawling around up there with a bucket of tar which he has
got on his moustache and his face and he looks up because he
hears the clatter of hooves.


VIEW ON CHARLEY HECKLER

Galloping his horse up to Little Bill's house and Charley is
very excited and he swings off the horse in front of the
porch and the porch is at once closer to completion and
closer to collapse than last we saw it.

             CHARLEY
           (looking around,
           breathless)
     Little Bill, Little Bill...

           LITTLE BILL'S VOICE o.s.
     Yeah.

Charley looks up, startled and Little Bill is looking down at
him over the eaves.

           LITTLE BILL
            (sheepish)
     Makin' some repairs.

             CHARLEY
          (breathless)
     The killed one of them cowboys.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 83

NIGHT, CLOSE VIEW on torchlight flickering on Davey's waxy
face and dead eyes as Eggs, Germany Joe and Paddy haul the
blood-caked body from the back of a buckboard.  WW is
looking on queasily, taking notes, and behind him the street
is alive.

          WIGGENS' VOICE o.s.
     ...an' Parsons said how he seen
     three men right after sun-up
     headed out East an' one was ridin'
     a old blue Morgan an' another was
     on a white mare, only he didn't...

And only a few yards away from the buckboard, in front of
the County Office, Little Bill is being besieged by Deputies
and Townsmen.

              FATTY
     Amos over at the stable says to
     ask you if the County's payin'
     feed for ALL the horses or if...

             CHARLEY
     ...Witherspoon says he ain't
     gonna sell us no more thirty-
     thirty shells without we pay...

And the dogs, snarling, fangs bared, pulling at the leash
and Tom Luckinbill is trying to keep control.

               TOM
     ...use the dogs then the county's
     gotta take responsibility for...

           LITTLE BILL
             (calmly)
     Never mind about them horses,
     Fatty.  Just you ride out to the
     Bar T an' make sure that other
     cowboy stays put an' don't expose
     himself, hear?


INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT 84

Alice's room and the whores.  They are sitting glumly in the
dim light of a simple lamp.  Little Sue is wiping tears away
and Delilah is staring blankly.

             DELILAH
           (to no one in particular)
     I didn't think they'd really do it.

              ALICE
             (nasty)
     What did you think, they come
     clear up from Kansas to fuck us?

             DELILAH
            (vacantly)
     That Kid... he's just a... boy.
     And that other one, Bill, being
     true to his wife...

              ALICE
     What wife?  He don't have no wife.

             DELILAH
          (shocked, hurt)
     He said...

              ALICE
     I told you, he don't have no
     wife, not aboveground, anyhow.

Delilah just eats the pain raw and just then...

SMASH!  A rock comes through the window and you can hear
someone shouting.

           VOICE OUTSIDE o.s.
     You fuckin' murderin' whores.

And they all sit there stunned and then Alice recovers and
gets up and goes to the window and hurls the rock back.

              ALICE
            (shouting)
     HE HAD IT COMING!  HE HAD IT
     COMING FOR WHAT HE DID... AND
     THAT OTHER ONE TOO... BOTH OF
     THEM... FOR WHAT THEY DONE.


EXT. COUNTY OFFICE - NIGHT 85

Little Bill and the crowd and the torches outside the County
Office and suddenly there is a commotion and shouting and
everybody turns North and...

Fuzzy is riding into town at full gallop shouting at the top
of his lungs.

              FUZZY
     We got one.  We got one of them
     fuckers, we got one...

Bystanders part as Fuzzy brings the horse up in front of the
County Office and reins hard and addresses himself
breathlessly to Little Bill.

              FUZZY
     We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff,
     out by Cow Creek, we...

           LITTLE BILL
     Alive?

              FUZZY
     Hell, yeah.  A bunch of us Bar T
     boys went out lookin' on account
     of them killin' one of our own.
     We come across this fucker on a
     roan goin' South an'...

           LITTLE BILL
     He admit it?

              FUZZY
     No... but I guess he will soon
     enough.  Had a Spencer rifle on
     him an' he was...

           LITTLE BILL
     Those cowboys messin' him up?

              FUZZY
     Uh... a little, maybe.

           LITTLE BILL
            (to Clyde)
     You an' Andy get the hell out
     there.  Find out where them other
     two went.


EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAWN 86

DAWN, the outhouse, birds chirping cheerily and the outhouse
door opens and BUCK BARTHOL steps out and stretches
luxuriously.

VIEW on bushes and The Kid holding his nose.  The bushes are
right behind the outhouse and the stink is terrible.  The
Kid is crouched there and he is doing an elaborate pantomime
of his suffering for Munny's benefit.


INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY 87

VIEW on Buck coming into the bunkhouse.  There isn't much
light and the shadowy sleeping figures are more easily
discernable by the snorts and snores they make than by their
shapes...  except for THIRSTY and Quick Mike who are
sitting, half dressed at a table rolling cigarettes.

             THIRSTY
     See anythin' out there, Buck?

              BUCK
     Hell, yes I did.
           (Mike looks up nervously)
     Seen about two hundred fellers
     packin' rifles... Fuckers got the
     place surrounded, says they want
     Quick Mike's ass... I says, "How
     much?"  They says, "About five."
     I says, "Dollars?" They says,
     "Cents."  I says, "Sold."

              MIKE
     Well I ain't worried I got
     protection.
          (he indicates a nearby bunk)

Fatty snoring on the bunk near Quick Mike.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 88

CLOSE on Ned's face, nose bloodied, eye blackened, as he
rides down the Main Street of Big Whiskey escorted by six
cowboys (including Texas Slim, Johnny Foley and Lippy
MacGregor) and Clyde and Andy.  Ned's wrists are tied and he
looks sullen and... scared.

Little Bill and WW Beauchamp are standing on the porch of
the County Office when the little group pulls up attended by
numerous onlookers.  Little Bill looks Ned over coolly as he
addresses Clyde.

           LITTLE BILL
     He tell you where them others is?

              CLYDE
     Nope.

           LITTLE BILL
     He give 'em names?

              CLYDE
     Didn't give us nothin' but his
     own name... Ned Roundtree.

           LITTLE BILL
     Well, Ned, you'll want to tell me
     an' Mister Beauchamp here all
     about them two villainous friends
     of yours, I guess.
          (to Clyde and Andy)
     Bring him in, boys, for I will be
     glad to know the names and the
     whereabouts of those other two
     murdering sonsofbitches.


EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 89

VIEW on the mid day sun blazing from on high and an enormous
farting sound...

VIEW ON THE OUTHOUSE

After a pause, another vigorous fart and then silence broken
only by the buzzing of flies, and then the sound of
newspaper and suddenly the door opens and Thirsty steps out
and heads up toward the bunkhouse.

VIEW ON THE KID

In the bushes reacting to the smell and the flies are
buzzing furiously.

             THE KID
     Sure is fuckin' ripe.  I wish
     we'd get a breeze.

Munny wipes sweat from his face and looks up at the blazing
sun.

              MUNNY
     It's gonna get riper yet.

             THE KID
     You still think he's in there?

              MUNNY
          (his eyes on the
            bunkhouse)
     Yeah, he's in there.

             THE KID
     Well, he's holding on to his
     shit like it was money.

              MUNNY
     He's in there.

             THE KID
     Tell me right off if you see
     him.

              MUNNY
     Yup.

             THE KID
     You... you ain't gonna shoot him
     yourownself?

              MUNNY
          (tired of saying it)
     You can shoot him.

The Kid nods, satisfied, but he's keyed up something
ferocious and his fingers play nervously with his pistol.


INT. JAIL - DAY 90

CLOSE on Ned's face jammed against the bars of the cell in
the County Office.  He has been tied to the bars outside the
cell so that he is, more or less, spread-eagled in an
upright position with his bare back exposed to Little Bill
and Charley Hecker and WW Beauchamp.

           LITTLE BILL
     Now then, Ned... you an'...
     uh... Mister Quincy an' uh...
     What was that young feller's
     name?

               NED
     Tate.  Elroy Tate.

WW shakes his head at Little Bill and holds out his notebook
for Little Bill to see.

           LITTLE BILL
     That ain't what you said before,
     Ned.

Little Bill empties hot coals from the bowl of his pipe on
Ned's shoulders and Ned writhes and grots his teeth.

               NED
     Hellif it ain't.

           LITTLE BILL
            (looking at WW's notes)
     Before you said Elroy Quincy
     out of Medicine Hat an' Henry
     Tate out of Cheyenne.

               NED
     Fuck if I did.

           LITTLE BILL
          (refilling his pipe)
     Charley, go bring them whores
     here that fucked these boys the
     night of the storm.

             CHARLEY
     Strawberry Alice an' Silky?

           LITTLE BILL
     Yeah... an' fetch a bullwhip out
     of the German's.

Ned's face against the bars is covered with perspiration and
etched with fear as he hears the door close behind Charley.

           LITTLE BILL
          (lighting his pipe)
     Now, Ned... them whores are gonna
     lie different lies than you...
     an' when your lie ain't the same
     as their lie... I ain't gonna
     hurt no woman, I'm gonna hurt
     you... not gentle like I been
     doin' but... baaaad.

Ned swallows hard and sweats and waits.


INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY 91

CLOSE on cards.  They are playing at the little table in the
bunkhouse, Quick Mike, Buck, Thirsty, Fatty Rossiter and
OLAF HARKEN and Quick Mike doesn't even have a pair and
tosses his cards down in disgust and walks over to his bunk
and starts to put on his boots.

               BUCK
            (to Mike)
     Where you goin'?

            QUICK MIKE
     Take a shit.

              FATTY
           (he has two kings)
     Lemmee finish this hand, will
     you?

            QUICK MIKE
     You gonna protect me while I
     take a shit?

Quick Mike walks over to a peg and hangs a gunbelt over his
bare shoulder.

               BUCK
     You could get bushwhacked.

            QUICK MIKE
             (heading for the door)
     I'll fart on 'em.

             THIRSTY
          (starting to get up)
     I'll go with him.

            QUICK MIKE
     You could wipe my ass, Thirsty.

             THIRSTY
          (sitting down)
     Hell with him.  Man ain't polite,
     he oughta get shot.


EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 92

The Kid in the bushes and he hears the door slamming shut up
at the bunkhouse and he squints anxiously.

             THE KID
           (whispering)
     Is it him?

              MUNNY
          (watching Mike)
     Yup.

The Kid is beside himself, his throat goes dry and he gulps
for air and he brings the hammer back on his pistol and
squints anxiusly.

HIS POV:

Mike out of focus approaching from The Kid's POV and
gradually Mike comes into focus walking closer and we

VIEW ON THE KID

Sweating, tensed for action and Munny looks over at him.

              MUNNY
           (whispering)
     He's yours, Kid.  Can you get him?

And The Kid is biting his lip and doesn't answer and Quick
Mike is very close and The Kid brings up his pistol and
gulps and doesn't shoot and then it is too late because Mike
has entered the outhouse.

Munny is disgusted and he cocks the shotgun to do it
himself.

The Kid is walking on eggshells approaching the door of the
outhouse, pistol in his right hand and he reaches his left
hand to open the door but he is hesitant and...

Munny sees Fatty Rossiter step casually out of the bunkhouse
and Munny raises the shotgun and Fatty sees The Kid and
screams.

              FATTY
     ASSASSINS, BOYS, ASSASSINS!

BAWHOOM!  Munny lets go with the shotgun and Fatty dives
back into the bunkhouse and...

The Kid is startled and looks over his shoulder.

              MUNNY
     SHOOT HIM, KID!

and The Kid grabs the door with his left hand and opens it
and there is Mike sitting on the crapper astonished and one
hand is on his holstered pistol but he's frozen and The Kid
is pointing the Schofield at him but The Kid is frozen too.

               MIKE
     NO!  NO!

BLAM!  The Schofield jumps in The Kid's hand and Mike gets
it in the chest and there is smoke all over and The Kid
stares at Mike amazed and Mike who has a big splotch of
blood on his chest stares back at The Kid amazed also and
then...

BLAM, The Kid shoots him again, this time in the face.
BANG!  BANG!  shots from the bunkhouse and...

BAWHOOM!  Munny blasts the bunkhouse with shotgun.

              MUNNY
     Come on, Kid.

BLAM, The Kid shoots Mike's slumping body a third time and
he seems hypnotized but...

BANG BANG shots are coming from the bunkhouse and Munny is
screaming and The Kid tears himself away.


EXT. BUSHES - DAY 93

Munny crashing through the bushes and The Kid is a few yards
behind him and Munny stumbles and scrambles to his feet.

              MUNNY
     Did... you... get... him?

             THE KID
             (amazed)
     Yeah.


EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 94

The outhouse and Mike's body and Fatty and Thirsty and Buck
dashing past, waving their guns.


EXT. WOODS - DAY 95

The albino mare and the Morgan in the woods and Munny and
The Kid dash up to the horses, gasping for breath, and Munny
tries to mount still holding the shotgun and the horse
starts to prance around and Munny can't mount.

              MUNNY
     Hold still.

BANG, BANG, BANG shots are whistling around them and looking
back Munny can see his pursuers firing from cover fifty
yards away.

Munny shoves two shells in the shotgun and hands it to The
Kid who has mounted.

              MUNNY
     Cover me, Kid, while I mount.

             THE KID
            (panicked)
     I can't see 'em.

BANG BANG BANG

              MUNNY
     Just SHOOT!

And KA BLAMMM, The Kid lets go both barrels in the general
direction of the enemy and then Munny gallops away half on
his horse, half-off, in an undignified escape, bullets
whistling around his horse and The Kid behind him shouting.

             THE KID
     Where are you, Bill, where are
     you, I can't see you.  Wait for me.

and then they disappear and gradually the shooting atops.


EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 96

Open country at sundown seen from a low hill, and you can
barely make out a lone RIDER approaching in the extreme
distance.

VIEW ON MUNNY

Standing on the rise and watching the rider in the distance.

             THE KID
     Is that what it was like, Bill, in
     the old days... ridin' out with
     everybody shootin'... smoke all
     over an' folks yellin' an' bullets
     whizzin' by?

The Kis is behind Bill sitting under a large oak drinking
from a whiskey bottle.

              MUNNY
            (absently)
     Yeah, I guess so.

             THE KID
     Shit... I thought they was gonna
     get us.  I was even... scared a
     little... just for a minute.
             (pause)
     Was you ever scared in them days?

Munny turns from watching the rider's slow approach and
walks over to The Kid who can't see the rider from where
he's sitting.

              MUNNY
     I don't remember, Kid.  I was
     drunk most of the time.  Give me a
     pull on that bottle, will you?

Munny takes a big pull on the bottle, returns it to The Kid,
and walks back to the edge of the rise to resume his vigil.

The rider is a little closer now and the sun is a little
lower.  It is very beautiful.

             THE KID
          (drinking heavy)
     I shot that fucker three times.
     He was takin' a shit.  He went for
     his pistol an' I blazed away...
     first shot got him in the chest...

The Kid wipes whiskey from his chin.  He has been working
hard to make the hysteria he feels into a high... but it
won't quite come.

             THE KID
     Say, Bill...

              MUNNY
     Yeah.

Munny is watching the rider and the rider is closer.

             THE KID
     That was... the first one.

              MUNNY
     First one what?

             THE KID
     First one I ever killed.

              MUNNY
           (preoccupied with
            his vigil)
     Yeah?

             THE KID
     How I said I shot five men...
     it wasn't true.
           (long pause)
     That Mexican... the one that come
     at me with a knife... I busted his
     leg with a shovel... I didn't
     shoot him or nothin'.

Munny is watching the rider and the rider is much closer but
coming at a walk and Munny goes back over to The Kid for a
pull on the bottle and he's trying to make The Kid feel okay
when he says...

              MUNNY
     Well, that fella today, you shot
     him alright.

             THE KID
          (forced bravado)
     H-hell yeah.  I killed the hell
     out of him... three shots... he
     was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'...
     an'...

The Kid is shaking, becoming hysterical, he can't go on, and
Munny hands the bottle back.

              MUNNY
     Take a drink, Kid.

             THE KID
            (breaking down, crying)
     Oh Ch-ch-christ... it don't... it
     don't seem... real... How he's...
     DEAD... how he ain't gonna breathe
     no more... n-n-never.  Or the
     other one neither... On account
     of... of just... pullin' a
     trigger.

Munny walks back to the edge of the rise and watches the
rider and it is a lovely sunset happening and he is talking
to no one in particular.

              MUNNY
     It's a hell of a thing, ain't it,
     killin' a man.  You take
     everythin' he's got... an'
     everythin' he's ever gonna have...

             THE KID
          (trying to pull him-
          self together)
     Well, I gu-guess they had it...
     comin'.

              MUNNY
     We all got it comin', Kid.

VIEW on the rider at the foot of the rise and it is Little
Sue and

VIEW on Munny pulling the saddle bags off and Little Sue is
still mounted.  They are under the oak tree and it is dusk
and The Kid is just sitting there with his bottle.

              MUNNY
     I was watchin' you... seein' if
     you was followed.

           LITTLE SUE
           (scared to death)
     Silky an' Faith, they rode off to
     the East an' two deputies was
     followin' them.

Munny has lit a little candle and spread a blanket and he is
opening the bags to count the money.

              MUNNY
          (pouring out the
          coins and bills)
     You wanna help me count, Kid?

The Kid is leaning against the tree in a semi-stupor.

             THE KID
     I trust you, Bill.

              MUNNY
     Well, you don't wanna trust me too
     much.  We'll take Ned his share
     together so you don't figure I run
     off with it.

           LITTLE SUE
           (startled)
     Ned's share?

              MUNNY
            (counting)
     Yeah, he went South ahead of us.
     I guess we'll catch him before...

           LITTLE SUE
           (blurting it out)
     He's... he's dead.

              MUNNY
            (counting)
     No he ain't.  He went South
     yesterday.

           LITTLE SUE
     They... they killed him.  I...
     thought you know that.  I thought
     you knew because...

              MUNNY
           (looking up)
     Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went
     South yesterday.  He didn't even
     kill nobody.  Why would anybody
     kill Ned?

Little Sue just looks back at him, scared, trembling.

              MUNNY
           (realizing)
     Who killed him?

           LITTLE SUE
     Little Bill.  The... the Bar T
     boys caught him and Little Bill...

              MUNNY
     He hanged him?
            (Little Sue shakes her
            head "no")
     Shot him down?

           LITTLE SUE
     N-no.  He... he beat him up.  He
     was making him... answer
     questions... and beating him up...
     and then... Ned just died.
             (pause)
     Little Bill didn't mean to kill
     him... he said he was sorry an'
     all... but he said it was a good
     example anyhow.

              MUNNY
            (outraged)
     Good example!  Good example of
     what I'd like to know?  He didn't
     even kill nobody... he couldn't do
     it no more.

           LITTLE SUE
     They got... a sign on him says
     he was a killer.

              MUNNY
          (flabbergasted)
     A sign on him?

           LITTLE SUE
     In front of Greely's.  It says,
     "This here is what happens to..."

              MUNNY
          (incredulous)
     They got a sign on him in front
     of Greely's?

The Kid just has his head in his hands, it's too much for
him and Little Sue is scared shitless of Munny.

              MUNNY
     The questions Little Bill asked
     him... what sort of questions
     was they?

           LITTLE SUE
     About where you an' him
          (indicating The Kid)
     was... an' where you was from...
     an' what your names was... an'...

              MUNNY
     What'd Ned say?

           LITTLE SUE
     L-lies... at first.  About how you
     was just passin' through and didn't
     kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept
     askin' questions, mixin' him up,
     catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat
     on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie
     some more an' then... then...

              MUNNY
     Then... what?

           LITTLE SUE
     A cowboy come in sayin' you killed
     Quick Mike in the shit house at
     the Bar T...

               MUNNY
     An' Little Bill killed Ned for what
     I done?

           LITTLE SUE
     Not on purpose.  But he started
     hurtin' him worse... makin' him
     tell stuff.  First ned wouldn't
     say nothin'... but Little Bill
     hurt him so bad he said who you
     was...

Munny looks up sharply.  Little Sue is scared, her voice
quavers...

           LITTLE SUE contd.
     He said how you was really Three
     Fingered Jack out of Missouri...
     an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered
     Jack that dynamited the Rock
     Island and Pacific in '69 killin'
     women and children an' all?"  An'
     Ned says you done a lot worse than
     that, said you was more cold
     blooded than William Bonney or
     Clay Alisson or the James Brothers
     an' how if he hurt Ned again you
     was gonna come an' kill him like
     you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.

              MUNNY
     Didn't scare Little Bill though,
     did it?

           LITTLE SUE
     N-no, sir?

              MUNNY
     Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.

             THE KID
     Wha... what f-for?

              MUNNY
            (sharply)
     Lemmee see it.

             THE KID
           (giving it to him)
     Sure.  Sure, Bill.

Munny takes the pistol and begins to check it methodically,
inspecting the load first... and The Kid watches nervously,
shifting from foot to foot.

             THE KID
     You... you could keep it, Bill.
     I ain't... gonna use it no more,
     I ain't gonna kill nobody.

Munny, still checking the gun, glances up and meets The
Kid's uneasy gaze.

             THE KID
     I... I ain't like you, Bill.

Munny looks back at the pistol, checks the sights.

             THE KID
     You... gonna take... the money?

              MUNNY
          (to Little Sue)
     You better get on back, Miss.

And Little Sue, still mounted, breathes an enormous silent
sigh of relief and turns her horse away hastily and Munny,
satisfied with the pistol, sticks it in his belt and walks
over to the horse and pulls his sawed-off shotgun out of the
bedroll.

             THE KID
     You could have it.  All of it.

              MUNNY
     I thought you wanted to buy
     spectacles an' fancy clothes an'
     all.

             THE KID
     I'd rather be blind and ragged
     than dead, I guess.

Munny looks at The Kid who is behaving bravely but is
trembling anyway, scared, and Munny's eyes are full of
brutally painful memories.

              MUNNY
     Shit, Kid.  I ain't gonna kill
     you.  You're... the only friend
     I got.


EXT. NORTH ROAD - NIGHT 97

MOONLIGHT on the ordinance #14 sign on the North Road and
two riders come up slow, Munny and The Kid, and Munny reins
up and then The Kid does too.  Munny takes the saddle bags
off his horse.

              MUNNY
           (giving The Kid the bags)
     This here money, take my share an'
     Ned's an' leave it with my
     youngsters.  Tell 'em half goes to
     Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in
     a week.  The rest is yours... you
     could buy them spectacles.

             THE KID
     Are you... Are you gonna...
     kill Little Bill?

              MUNNY
          (holding up the
          whiskey bottle)
     I guess you won't mind my keepin'
     the bottle.

             THE KID
     You're gonna kill him, ain't you?

              MUNNY
     Stay clear of folks you might see.
     There's plenty out lookin' to
     hang you.  Go on now, skedaddle.

Munny slaps The Kid's horse and The Kid sets out at a trot
and Munny watches him disappear into the night.  When he is
alone and he can't hear The Kid's horse any more, Munny
uncorks the bottle and takes a long deep drink.


EXT. GREELY'S PORCH - NIGHT 98

VIEW on Ned's body in the upright coffin in the flickering
light of a torch standing next to it and, of course, Ned
looks bad and the crudely scrawled sign over the coffin
says, "This is what happens to assassins around here."


INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT 99

VIEW on Little Bill in the crowded bar and he is shouting to
make himself heard over the din.

           LITTLE BILL
     Alright, I'm gonna say just one
     more time so it's all clear an'
     then don't ask me no more.

The place is packed with tired, dusty men and they are not
really jubilant so much as they are excited by the hysteria
of events.

           LITTLE BILL
           (continuing)
     Now each of you that posse'd
     today has got one drink comin'
     off the county budget...

             THIRSTY
     Yahoo.

           LITTLE BILL
     ...an' whoever rode yesterday,
     gets one drink for that...

              PADDY
     Yippee.

              EGGS
     I told yuh two, I...

           LITTLE BILL
     Hold it hold it.  After them two,
     it's outta your own pocket...
     hear me, Skinny? ...an' we're
     pullin' out early tomorrow an'
     chase these fellas clear to Texas
     so I wouldn't spend much of your
     own money.

There is a general whoop and hubbub as Little Bill turns
back to his conversation at the bar with Charley, Fatty,
Clyde, Andy and WW Beauchamp.

           LITTLE BILL
     Now if we divide up into four
     parties an' hit all the farms an'
     trails in a circle, we're bound
     to find some one who seen them
     skunks an'...

Little Bill is suddenly conscious of his own loud voice in a
sudden silence that has swept the bar like a brushfire and
turning he sees what everybody is staring at.

Munny, with his ten-gauge shotgun leveled from the shoulder,
is standing thirty feet away in the doorway.  Taking a
couple of sideways steps to get the door from behind his
back and sweeping the twin barrels in an ominous arc, he
surveys the scene.

              MUNNY
          (a little drunk)
     Which fucker owns this shithole?

Nobosy says a thing.  Skinny stares pop-eyed from behind the
bar and the sweat starts on his forehead and Little Bill is
thinking coolly and everybody else is swallowing hard and
looking at the shotgun.

              MUNNY
            (to Fatty)
     You there, fat man, speak up.

Fatty gulps and then Skinny screws up his courage and steps
from behind the bar and gives it every bit of dignity his
fear will permit.

              SKINNY
     I... I own this establishment.
     I bought it from Greely for a
     thous...

              MUNNY
           (to the men round
             Skinny)
     Better step clear, boys.

And Skinny looks from side to side as people step away from
him and he wants to say something desperately, he wants to
live, he wants...

           LITTLE BILL
     Hold on, mist...

BAH-WHOOM!  Munny fires and smoke belches and...

Skinny is blown back against the wall and falls to the
floor a bloody mess and...

Little Bill is reaching for the Spencer which is leaning
against the bar near his leg but he freezes because...

Munny has turned the shotgun on him and Munny sees Ned's
Spencer there and his eyes show how he feels about it.

For a moment while the smoke clears the bar is silent and
there are nervous glances cast at the bloody body of Skinny
but Little Bill keeps his eyes on Munny.

           LITTLE BILL
     Well sir... You are a cowardly
     sonofabitch because you have just
     shot down an unarmed man.

It has become a very formal moment and there are,
figuratively speaking, only two people in the room, Munny
and Little Bill... and WW Beauchamp is watching them, scared
to death, but this is it, what all those Easterners dreamed
about, the showdown in the saloon.

              MUNNY
             (the shotgun pointed
             right at Little Bill)
     He should have armed himself if he
     was gonna decorate his saloon with
     the body of my friend.

           LITTLE BILL
     I guess you are Three-Fingered
     Jack out of Missouri, killer of
     women and children.

              MUNNY
             (a little drunkenly)
     I have done that... killed women
     and children... I have killed most
     everything that walks or crawls
     an' now I have come to kill you,
     Little Bill, for what you done to
     Ned.
          (to the others)
     Now step aside. boys.

And as the deputies nervously move aside Little Bill helps
to isolate himself by stepping forward boldly.

            LITTLE BILL
     He's got one barrel left,
     gentlemen.  After he has used it,
     pull your pistols and shoot him
     down like the cowardly, drunken
     scoundrel he is.

Little Bill looks back at Munny bravely and...

Munny looks down the barrel at Little Bill and after a tense
moment he pulls the trigger.

CLICK.  The hammer falls but it is a misfire and what
happens next happens in maybe five seconds as all hell
breaks loose.

           LITTLE BILL
            (drawing)
     Misfire!  Kill the sonofabitch!

And Little Bill aims carefully and...

Munny hurls the shotgun at him and...

BLAM!... Little Bill fires wildly as the shotgun hits him
and...

Clyde has his pistol out and is pointing it at Munny and...

Munny is pulling the pistol from his own belt and he drops
to one knee and...

BLAM!... Clyde fires and misses and...

Little Bill is about to squeeze the trigger when...

BLAM!... Munny shoots him and...

BLAM!... Little Bill shoots just as he is hit in the chest
and...

BLAM!  BLAM!... Fatty fires wildly and...

Munny is aiming too and BLAM!...

Clyde gets it in the face and...

BLAM!... BLAM!... Fatty isn't even aiming while...

Andy aims carefully, he can kill Munny but...

Munny turns and points his weapon at Andy and...

Instead of firing Andy panics and tries to turn his body
sideways to ward off the blow and...

BLAM!... Munny fires and...

Andy gets it high in the rib cage and...

Charley turns and runs for the back and...

BLAM!  BLAM!... Fatty is backing up and firing from the hip
and then he turns to run and...

Munny aims deliberately from one knee and BLAM!...

Fatty goes down, shot in the back...

And suddenly... there is a terrible silence that is broken
only by the awful, dying groans of Clyde and the coughing of
the bystanders hiding behind tables and chairs in the thick
black smoke and...

Munny is still down on one knee pointing his pistol and
looking through the thick smoke for someone to shoot but it
seems there are no threats left.

               MUNNY
     Every asshole that doesn't want
     to get shot best clear out the
     back quick.

And they scramble over each other dashing toward the
Billiard Room and Munny stands up and looks around and he
looks at Clyde who is groaning, his face covered with blood
and everyone else, Little Bill, Andy and Fatty are still,
and then Fatty seems to move and Munny levels his pistol and
what happens is WW crawls out from half-under Fatty and WW
is covered with blood and he is shaking like a leaf.

               WW
     I... I... think I'm... shot.

              MUNNY
     You ain't shot.

               WW
          (seeing the pistol)
     P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.
             (as Munny lowers the
            pistol, WW looks around)
     M-m-my G-god.  You killed...
     Little Bill.

              MUNNY
           (suspicious)
     You sure you ain't armed?

               WW
     I never c-c-carry arms.  I'm...
     a writer.

              MUNNY
     A writer?  What do you write...
     letters an' such?

               WW
     B-b-books.
            (amazed)
     You... you killed five men...
     singlehanded.

              MUNNY
            (wearily)
     Yeah.

Munny walks over to the bar, keeping his eye suspiciously on
WW, and reaches for a bottle with his left hand.  The hand
is shaking like palsy and he tilts the bottle and drinks
sloppily with effort, the pistol still in his right hand.

               WW
     Wh-wh-who did you kill first?

              MUNNY
     Huh?

               WW
            (reciting)
     Wh-wh-when confronted by superior
     numbers, the experienced
     gunfighter will fire on the best
     shots first.

              MUNNY
            (drinking)
     Yeah?

Unnoticed on the floor, Little Bill is conscious though
blood is coming out of his mouth and he has been written
off.  One hand is shifting on his pistol and he can hear
Clyde moaning sporadically.

               WW
     Little Bill told me that.  You
     killed him first, didn't you?

On the floor, Little Bill is fighting for consciousness,
fingering his pistol.

              MUNNY
     I was lucky in the order.
            (bitterly)
     I always been lucky killin'
     folks.

               WW
     Who was next?  Clyde?  Or was it...?

              MUNNY
           (suddely ominous,
          pistol pointing)
     I could tell you who was last,
     mister.

WW's eyes pop as he gets the idea and he backs up fast, and
then he turns and bolts out the back, and watching him go,
Munny turns his back on the fallen body of Little Bill.

Little Bill, on the floor, raises up his pistol in his
shaking hand and aims at Munny's back maybe six feet away
and he is shaking bad as he draws the hammer back and...

Munny hears the click and he turns and sees Little Bill
aiming but it is too late and...

BLAM!  Smoke and fire from Little Bill's pistol and Little
Bill's arm collapses from the effort and the pistol falls
with a bang.

              MUNNY
     Missed again, asshole.

And Munny steps over to him and kicks the pistol away from
Little Bill's outstretched hand.  Little Bill is bleeding
from the mouth having taken a shot in the lung and he is
very weak and all he can do is look up at Munny and speak
weakly.

           LITTLE BILL
     I don't... deserve this... to
     die this way.  I was... building
     a house.

              MUNNY
           (aiming his pistol
           point blank)
     "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little
     Bill.

           LITTLE BILL
            (the pistol in his face)
     I'll see you... in hell, you
     three-fingered asshole.

BLAM!  Munny shoots Little Bill and then he looks around and
Clyde is still groaning and that is the only sound.  Then,
suddenly, he is all business.  He walks quickly over to
Clyde and shoots him once with the Spencer and the groaning
stops.  Then he goes to Little Bill's body and pokes around
in the pockets and pulls out some shells for the Spencer.
He shoves those in his pocket and he goes to the bar and
picks up the bottle of whiskey and walks over to the door.
Standing to one side, he kicks it open.  Then he sets down
the rifle and the bottle and starts to reload the Schofield
and while he loads it he shouts out the door.

              MUNNY
     I'm comin' outta here... an' any
     fucker I see out there, I'm gonna
     kill him... an' any fucker takes a
     shot at me, I ain't just gonna
     kill him, but I'm gonna kill his
     wife an' all his friends an' burn
     his fucking house, hear?

The pistol is loaded and Munny sticks it in his belt and he
takes a long pull on the whiskey bottle and wipes the
dribble from his chin.  Then he picks up the rifle in the
other hand and looks out the door.


EXT. MAIN STREET/GREELY'S - NIGHT 100

The street and it is dark and quiet, shadowy buildings, the
knot of tethered horses, a couple of torches stuck in the
ground sputtering.

           MUNNY'S VOICE o.s.
     Nobody better shoot on account of
     I'm as mean as I say... maybe
     meaner.  I am a damn badman an'
     you will not find a worse one in
     hell.

And Munny steps out the door warily, and looks around and all
he sees are the shadowy buildings and all he hears are his
own boots on the wooden porch.  Glancing nervously at the
dark buildings' blank stares he walks past the upright
coffin where the waxy face of Ned stares gruesomely in the
light of the flickering torch and he gives it a glance,
wanting to say he's sorry, but the idea is ludicrous and he
steps off the porch and walks toward the white mare.


EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 101

WW Beauchamp and Charley Hecker and Germany Joe crouched in
the alleyway between two buildings across the street and
Charley has a rifle and they can see Munny mounting his
horse.

           GERMANY JOE
           (whispering)
     Go ahead, shoot him.

Charley just shakes his head and offers the rifle to Germany
Joe.  And Germany Joe doesn't want it.

           GERMANY JOE
     I endt no dehpoody.

WW is watching Munny's unbelievably awkward and prolonged
mounting procedure and he can't believe it, he can't believe
what the Old West is like and it shows on his face.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 102

Munny riding down the dark, lonely street at a trot and he
starts to shout at the top of his lungs.

              MUNNY
     You boys better bury old Ned
     right... and you better not carve
     up nor otherwise harm no
     whores... or I will come back an'
     kill more sonsabitches, hear?

And there are tears running down Munny's cheeks.


EXT. SOD HUT - DAY 103

DAYLIGHT and Penny sweeping in the doorway of Munny's sod
hut in Kansas.  She is intent on her work until she hears
the snort of a horse and looks up and her jaw drops, and her
face lights up like the sun itself and, dropping the broom,
she dashes toward him.

VIEW ON MUNNY

Munny walking across the field, leading the mare.  He is
covered with dust and heavily stubbled from the trip.  Penny
dashes up to him and throws her arms around him and he is
overjoyed but he doesn't have any way to express it except
through awkwardness and embarrassment.

              MUNNY
             (fondly)
     Ain't you a lady!

And he puts his arm around her and they walk toward the
house.


EXT. HOG PENS - DAY 104

VIEW ON WILL

Working in the hog pens in back, concentrating on the job.

              MUNNY
     Place looks good.

And Will whirls around and sees Munny standing there beside
the house and his first instinct is to run to him and then
he remembers his dignity and stands there like a man, but
the grin is liable to break his face.

              WILL
     Hullo, paw.

              MUNNY
     I guess you lost some hogs to
     the fever.

              WILL
     Three.

              MUNNY
     Three?  That ain't bad considerin'.

Will is pissing in his pants with pride and pleasure and he
joins his father and they walk around the house together.

              WILL
     That fella come by... Tom.

              MUNNY
            (stopping)
     Tom?

              WILL
     The one you rode out after...
     the one that had the pistol...

              MUNNY
     The Kid, yeah...

              WILL
     Only he wasn't carryin' no pistol
     this time.


INT. SHED - DAY 105

Will and Munny in te shed and Will is digging deep into a
huge pile of straw.

              MUNNY
            (worried)
     He say anythin'... The Kid... ?

              WILL
            (digging)
     Tom?  Only how... how if you
     didn't... didn't come back in a
     week...
             (upset)
     how we was to take half the
     money to Sally an' say you was...

              MUNNY
             (gently)
     Well, I come back, didn't I?

And Will has exposed the saddle bags and Munny moves in and
opens them and gold coins and wads of bills spill out.

              WILL
             (upset)
     Did you... did you... ?

              MUNNY
            (counting)
     Did I what?

              WILL
     All that money... I mean...
     did you...?

              MUNNY
            (counting)
     Steal it?  Naw, I didn't steal it.

              WILL
     No... I meant...

              MUNNY
            (turning)
     What?

              WILL
     K-k-kill somebody?

              MUNNY
     Who said that?

              WILL
     N-nobody... only you took your
     shotgun an' that pistol an'...

              MUNNY
          (bothered, putting
          his arm around
           Will's shoulders)
     Before I met your maw, God rest
     her soul, it used to be I was
     kinda... wicked... drinkin'
     spirits an' gettin' into scrapes
     an' all.  Only she made me see the
     error of my ways an'... I ain't
     like I was no more.

              WILL
           (relieved)
     I guess you didn't kill nobody
     then.

              MUNNY
           (it is an effort)
     Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.


EXT. GRAVE - DAY 106

The grave of Claudia under the trees and Munny walks up to
it and maybe we hear music or maybe just the wind, but the
words begin to crawl across the screen, supered.

             WRITTEN WORDS (crawl)
     They were married in St. Louis in
     1B70 and they traveled North to
     Kansas where he engaged in farming
     and swine husbandry.  She bore him
     two children in the eight years of
     their marriage and when she died,
     it was not at his hands as her
     mother might have expected, but of
     smallpox.

VIEW ON MUNNY

We are looking at him by now and there is nothing easy on
his face, no big emotions, he is just looking at the grave.

          WRITTEN WORDS (crawl cont'd)
     Some years later, Mrs. Ansonia
     Feathers made the arduous journey
     to Hodgeman County to visit the
     last resting place of her only
     daughter.

VIEW ON THE GRAVE

We are looking at the stone now and the words continue.

          WRITTEN WORDS (crawl cont'd)
     William Munny had long since sold
     the place and disappeared with the
     children... some said to San
     Francisco where it was rumored he
     prospered as a dry goods merchant
     under a different name.

CLOSE ON THE EYES OF WILLIAM MUNNY

The eyes of the husband and the pig-farmer and the man who
shot down five men in the Big Whiskey saloon.

          WRITTEN WORDS (crawl cont'd)
     And there was nothing on the stone
     to explain to Mrs. Feathers why
     her only daughter had married a
     known thief and murderer, a man of
     notoriously vicious and
     intemperate disposition.
