     FADE IN

     on the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words
     on the side of the plane.

     INT. AIRPLANE

     ANGLE DOWN

     on a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. 
     Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces
     the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast
     pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs
     to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. 
     The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to
     him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a
     small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport
     is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in
     CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH.

                    EMIL (V.O.)
          Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I
          say.  Don't open your mouth.

                    OLEG (V.O.)
          Okay.

     INT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

     CAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are
     split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for
     visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An
     unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. 
     Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His
     eyes are alert, cunning and smart.

     OLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not
     tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. 
     (The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.)

                    EMIL
          Don't fool around.

                    OLEG
          Okay.

     Oleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to
     take a picture of himself.

                    EMIL
          Did you hear what I said?

                    OLEG
          I want to document my trip to America.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Next.
               (Emil steps up)
          Could I see your documents, please?

                    EMIL
          Yes sir.

     He hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an
     image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          What is your intended purpose of your
          visit to the United States?

                    EMIL
          Two weeks holiday.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          How much money are you carrying with
          you?

                    EMIL
          I have five-hundred dollars.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the
          FIS area!

     Oleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration
     Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D)
               (to Emil)
          Is he with you?  Are you travelling
          together?

                    EMIL
          Yes.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Please join us.
               (to Oleg)
          Come on forward.

                    EMIL
          Is there a problem?

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          No, you're travelling together.  I want
          to talk to you together.  Hi, how are
          you?  Can I take a look at your
          documents?
               (takes Oleg's passport)
          Are you related?

                    OLEG
          Yes...he's my friend.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Okay.  You're a Czech national and
          you're a Russian national.  How do you
          know one another?

     Oleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off.

                    EMIL
          We are both from Prague.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               (to Oleg)
          How long are you planning to stay?

                    EMIL
          Two weeks.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          I'd like to speak for himself, okay?

                    EMIL
          He doesn't speak English.

                    OLEG
          I speak English.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
               (to Oleg)
          Then answer my questions.  Where were
          you planning to stay during the two
          weeks that you're here?

                    OLEG
          New York.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Yes, we're in New York now.  But where
          are you planning to stay in New York?

                    OLEG
          A cheap hotel.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          What are you coming here to do?

                    OLEG
          I'm here for movies.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Movies...to be in the movies or to see
          movies?

                    OLEG
          Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I
          see movie at school called "It's a
          Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. 
          Ever since I want to come to America. 
          Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A
          land where anyone can be anything. As
          long as they are white.

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Excuse me?

                    EMIL
          He made joke, bad joke.  First time on
          airplane...

     The SUPERVISOR comes over to see what the problem is:

                    IMMIGRATION OFFICER
          Well, they've got valid visas, but they
          don't have much money.  Uh... and I'm
          not...uh, I think there's a possibility
          they may be coming to live and reside.

                    SUPERVISOR
          Look how long the line is.  We gotta
          move 'em out.  I'll take them down to
          secondary.

     Emil looks at Oleg, pissed.

     INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

     The place is empty except for one table at the end of the
     bar.  EDDIE FLEMMING, Manhattan's most famous detective, and
     his savvy, black partner, LEON JACKSON are having cocktails. 
     Eddie is smoothly handsome, tough, smart and tired.  Not only
     is he the best homicide detective Manhattan has ever seen,
     he's continually mentioned in New York columns and has been
     the subject of several magazine articles.  There's even been
     a TV movie about one of his biggest cases.  Leon has been
     with Eddie a long time and was also featured in the TV movie.

     Sitting with Eddie and Leon is ROBERT HAWKINS, host and star
     reporter for the tabloid show, "Top Story."  Hawkins is also
     the best in the business and has dealt with them all: Joey
     Buttafuco and Amy Fisher, Lorena Bobbit and OJ.

     Wait staff bustles in the b.g. doing the morning set up. 
     Hawkins listens as Eddie, cigar in hand, finishes a "war
     story" and a vodka tonic at the same time.

                    EDDIE
          So we're waitin' to hit this warrant -
          we got Emergency Service with the heavy
          weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I
          say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I
          go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the
          sudden I turn around and a kid with a
          shotgun let one go.  Right where I was
          standin'.  That coulda been it.  I
          coulda had my head blown off and for
          what?  Some stupid kid got panicky,
          takes the safety off and it's over.  If
          I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for
          a bad habit - I would've had my head
          blown off.

                    HAWKINS
          Jesus Christ.

     PAULIE, the owner, walks up.

                    PAULIE
          Speakin' of bad habits, everybody okay?

                    HAWKINS
          Another martini.

                    LEON
          Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.

                    EDDIE
          Vodka tonic.

                    LEON
               (rethinks it)
          Maybe you could just put in a shot of
          Martell?

     Paulie takes the drinks off the table and an empty bottle of
     vodka.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
               (of Eddie's story)
          It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid
          kid.

                    EDDIE
          What's the kid gonna say - sorry? 
          Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. 
          Like last week - we were at the morgue
          and this guy was all chopped up - spleen
          here - liver there - his heart in a pan. 
          Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his
          dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who
          knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3
          or some shit and shot him and now you
          can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a
          human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. 
          Sooner or later.  That's me.  

                    HAWKINS
          Sooner or later that's everybody.  

                    EDDIE
          Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like
          that.  I mean, what do I got left? 
          Coupla articles.  A medal or two. 
          Plaque here and there and in a coupla
          years no one remembers me anymore.

                    HAWKINS
          I think you're getting a little moody
          there, Eddie.

                    EDDIE
          I'm not moody.

     Hawkins and Leon share a look.

                    HAWKINS
          Isn't he a little moody?

                    LEON
          Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in
          love.

                    HAWKINS
          In love?  With who?

     Paulie delivers the drinks and sets some cigars on the table. 
     Takes a seat next to Eddie.  Eddie asks Hawkins.

                    EDDIE
          How old are your kids?

                    HAWKINS
          My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. 
          Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're
          thinking about having a kid!  How old
          are you?  Never mind. 
          Let me just tell you this: Every stupid
          cliche you hear about kids - they change
          your life, they make you a better
          person, they make you whole...
               (beat)
          It's all true!  Before I had kids when
          friends talked about their kids, I
          wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I
          right, Leon?

                    LEON
          Absomotherfuckin'lutely.  You can have
          all three of my ex-wives.  But somebody
          so much as looks sideways at my four
          girls -- I'd kill 'em.  
               (takes out his wallet)
          You haven't seen my youngest have you?

     As he hands pictures to Hawkins his cell phone rings.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          Yeah?

                    HAWKINS
          Paulie, you've got kids, right?

                    PAULIE
          My kids don't talk to me anymore but
          they were great when they were young.

                    LEON
               (into the phone)
          Sure it's him?  Great!
               (collapses the phone)
          Unique's home.

     They all rise from the table.

                    EDDIE
          Paulie, I need the cure.

                    PAULIE
          Step into my office.

     Leon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave.

                    HAWKINS
          So you got your kids listening to Opera? 
          You still singing in the church on the
          weekends?

     INT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY

     Now other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've
     been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg.

                    SECONDARY OFFICER
          Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I
          understand that.
               (to Emil)
          And what kind of work do you do?

                    EMIL
          I am butcher.

                    SECONDARY OFFICER
          You're a butcher?  What do you use pig
          intestines for?

                    EMIL
          You stuff sausage in it.

                    SECONDARY OFFICER
          And what do you do with the bones?

                    EMIL
          Dog food.

     Emil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport
     Control for their detainment.

                    SECONDARY OFFICER
          Are you married?

                    EMIL
          No.  Are you proposing?

     ANGLE UP

     through a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us...

     INT. MENS ROOM

     Eddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink
     full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot
     eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror.

                    EDDIE
          Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? 
          What are you doin' Saturday?

     Leon enters.  Eddie turns.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna propose.

                    LEON
          When?

                    EDDIE
          Tomorrow.  At lunch.

                    LEON
          You ready?

     Eddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns.

                    EDDIE
          The thrill of the hunt.  I love it.

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

     Oleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop
     action.  Each stands with an old suitcase.

                    OLEG
               (in Russian)
          Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the
          movies!

                    EMIL
               (in Czech)
          Don't speak Russian!

                    OLEG
               (in Russian)
          Why?  Why do I always have to speak to
          you in Czech?

                    EMIL
               (in Czech)
          Because I don't like your ugly language. 
          I heard enough of it in school!  Now
          speak Czech or English.  And don't fool
          around anymore.  You almost got us
          thrown out!

     Emil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This
     is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring
     inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A
     videocamera's pointed out in the street.

                    OLEG
          Look.  New videocameras.  Color
          viewfinder.  Image stabilization. 
          Solarization.  Night vision.

                    EMIL
          We have no money.  Come on.

     Oleg stares at the videocamera - dying to have one like this. 
     Emil slides into the cab.

                    CABBIE
          Where you wanna go, buddy?

     Emil pulls out the post-marked envelope.  Points to the
     return address on it and passes it through the slot to the
     Cabbie.

                    EMIL
          Here.

     Emil looks out the window - no sign of Oleg.  Then, Oleg
     hurries out the camera store, gripping something inside his
     coat.  He flings both suitcases in the trunk, SLAMS it shut 
     and jumps in the back seat.  He opens his jacket - pulling
     out the VIDEOCAMERA he just stole.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Go!

     Oleg smiles sheepishly at Emil.
          

     EXT. SPANISH HARLEM - DAY

     Eddie's car pulls up.  Eddie, Leon and Hawkins get out.

                    HAWKINS
          So what's unique?

                    EDDIE
          Not what.  Who.

     Eddie passes Hawkins a Polaroid - of a woman on a bed -
     covered in blood.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was
          taking too long to put her make-up on. 
          they were late for a party.  Stabbed her
          with a beer bottle.

                    HAWKINS
          That's unique.

                    EDDIE
          Yeah.  And he still went to the party.

     Leon moves to a LOOKOUT - gives him a twenty.

                    LOOKOUT
          Top floor.  Back room.

                    EDDIE
          Yeah.  I make big cases, they make the
          news and I look good.  But the problem
          with becoming a star is downtown.  They
          shoot at stars.  Now be quiet.  Shhh.

     As they reach the doorway - Eddie surprises two crackheads. 
     Waves them off.  They hurry away.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees
          are killing me.  Stay behind me.

                    HAWKINS
          You're worried for my safety.  I'm
          touched.

     Eddie flattens against the building - watches Unique descend
     the fire escape.

                    HAWKINS (CONT'D)
          Ready?

                    EDDIE
          Keep them out of my way.

                    HAWKINS
          Okay.  You ready?

                    EDDIE
          Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.

     Eddie closes in.

                    HAWKINS
               (into his cell phone)
          COME ON!  COME ON!  YOU FUCKING GUYS,
          LET'S MOVE IT!

     Unique is climbing down the fire escape - before he gets to
     the bottom, Leon bursts through a door behind him and kicks
     the fire escape, sending Unique flying into the alley.  Where
     he lands dropping his gun.

     Eddie pulls him off the ground as Leon scoops the gun up.

                    EDDIE
          What's your rush?  Going to a party?

                    UNIQUE
          Why you chasin' me, man?

                    EDDIE
          I don't know.  You always come outta
          your house that way?

                    UNIQUE
          It's not my house, man.  I don't live
          here.

                    EDDIE
          Well, sounds like burglary to me.

     Leon cuffs Unique who recognizes Eddie.

                    UNIQUE
          I know you man.

     An unmarked van comes tearing into the scene.  Disgorges a
     mini-cam team that starts filming but they missed the bust.

                    HAWKINS
               (to Eddie)
          Any chance we can do that again?

                    EDDIE
          Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first
          time.
                              

     EXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY

     The cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg
     gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope
     into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks
     back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him.

                    EMIL
          Turn that off!  Get the bags.

                    OLEG
          Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a
          dog.

                    EMIL
          For five years I paid for your
          stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the
          rest of my life if I say so.
               (challenging)
          Unless you refuse, Oleg.

     Oleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil,
     he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the
     occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          There.  5RW.

     Emil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks
     and Emil pushes it open.

     INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY

     The brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the
     stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack
     pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl.

                    OLEG
          What?

                    EMIL
          Smell like chemicals...for smoking
          drugs.

     Emil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving
     down the dirty hallway to a corner door.

     INT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

     He KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS -
     a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. 
     He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg
     films him...

                    MILOS
          Emil???!

                    EMIL
          Surprise!  Surprise!

     Milos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his
     comely wife.

     INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Emil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears
     plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina
     has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished
     apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace,
     bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with
     kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is
     a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The
     following is in Czech and subtitled in English.)

                    EMIL
          Your sister said she didn't know where
          you were so you shouldn't write to her
          with return address if you're hiding. 

                    MILOS
          Did you hurt her?

                    EMIL
          You know me...I never hurt anybody. 
          Where's the money?

                    OLEG
          Hello, Tamina.

     Oleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks
     at Oleg.

                    MILOS
          Take your eyes off her, Oleg!
               (to Emil)
          Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were
          caught.
               (of Oleg)
          It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank
          clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going
          to wait!!!

                    EMIL
          Milos.  Get my money!

     Oleg videotapes the scene.

     CLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR

     All we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she
     obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped
     around her.

                    MILOS
               (nervously)
          We spent it!

                    EMIL
          Ha. Ha.

                    MILOS
          Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. 
          You think I'd be working if I had
          money?!

     Emil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN
     KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her
     throat.

                    MILOS (CONT'D)
          Emil.  Put down the knife.

     Milos looks at his wife - who is terrified.

                    MILOS (CONT'D)
          Emil.  I'll help you.

     Milos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm
     him by talking softly.

                    MILOS (CONT'D)
          I can get you a job.

                    EMIL
          A job?

                    MILOS
          Yes, the money is good.

                    EMIL
          As a plumber?!

                    MILOS
          It's easy to learn.

                    EMIL
          A job??  As a plumber???  You think I
          come to America to work!

                    MILOS
          We started over, you can too.

                    EMIL
               (furious)
          You spent all the money while I was in
          prison?  Now you tell me to get a job
          fixing toilets?!?

     Emil pulls the knife away from Tamina - then angrily PLUNGES
     it toward Milos' chest!

     Oleg videotapes it.  Then lowers the camera - shocked that
     Emil killed Milos.

     Blood sprays Tamina's face.  She tries to run but Oleg grabs
     her, not noticing her brushed gold bracelet falls to the
     floor.  He covers her mouth as he points the videocamera at
     Emil who STABS Tamina - absolutely enraged!

     THE WOMAN BEHIND THE DOOR

     flees...Emil hears NOISE in the bedroom - a window opening. 
     Emil kicks the bedroom door open.  Sees the window leading to
     the fire escape.  He dashes to it.  Sees four flights down -
     the WOMAN, wearing a summer dress.  Barefoot.  Her hair still
     wet.  

     She looks up.  She is beautiful and terrified.  She runs
     down the alley.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          She saw!

     Emil hurries toward the bathroom.  She just got out of the
     shower.  Her underwear and purse are draped over a chair. 
     Emil grabs the purse.  Finds a CZECHOSLOVAKIAN PASSPORT.  He
     opens the cover, stares at her photo and name.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Daphne Hanlova.

     There's one stamp in the passport - from the U.S. when she
     arrived - June 16, 1998.  Underneath is written - 6 MONTH
     STAY.  Emil flips through the rest of the passport - all
     blank pages.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Six month visa.  Still here two years
          later.  They'll deport her if she goes
          to Police.

     Emil pockets Daphne's passport and wallet, scoops up her
     shoes and jacket - enters the kitchen and dumps them on the
     floor.  He tears through the kitchen cabinets, throwing cans
     and bottles aside.

                    OLEG
          What are you looking for?

     Emil finds nail polish remover - looks at the bodies.

                    EMIL
          I'm going to make a bohemian barbecue.

     Emil draws the kitchen curtains plunging the room into
     darkness.
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

     A face comes from the darkness.  It's an athletically
     handsome man, jogging out of a tunnel towards us.  He's in a
     tie and jacket in Central Park at NIGHT. 
     He is JORDAN (JORDY) WARSAW.  A sensitive man of rugged
     honesty.  He runs down the hill in a hurry.  A MUGGER steps
     in his path.

                    MUGGER
          Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare
          twenty?

                    JORDY
          Look, I don't have time for you, get out
          of my way!!

                    MUGGER
          Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin'
          money?

     The Mugger pulls a knife - and in a whirl of movement, Jordy
     grabs his wrist and disarms him in a deadly, professional
     manner - hurling him down to the pavement, twisting his arm
     behind his back.  With his other hand, Jordy whips out a
     BROWNING 9MM from his shoulder holster and places it behind
     the mugger's head.  Jordy displays his shield.

                    JORDY
          Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you
          happy?

                    MUGGER
          Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry
          guns.

                    JORDY
          Oh yeah?  Guess again.

     Jordy handcuffs the Mugger and searches the Mugger's coat
     pockets - pulling out a handful of driver's licenses and
     credit cards.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Nice - how many people you ripped off
          tonight?!  Get up!

     As Jordy yanks the Mugger to his feet, his BEEPER goes off.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          You couldn't listen to me, could you?

     Jordy drags the Mugger to a tree.  Cuffs him so his face is
     pressed up against the bark.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          I'll send a cop back for you.

                    MUGGER
          Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like
          this.  Some freak'll come by and stab
          me!

     Jordy jogs off across the park.

                    MUGGER (CONT'D)
          Wait!  Come back!!

     EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

     FIRE TRUCKS from three battalions.  Radios CRACKLE.  There's
     a crowd growing.  Jordy pushes his way through.  The top
     floor of the brownstone where Milos and Tamina lived has been
     reduced to smoking ruins.  The trees are covered in debris
     and soot.  Jordy moves to LOUIE - Battalion Chief.

                    LOUIE
          Lieutenant - take up your line and
          relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top
          floor.

                    JORDY
          Hey, Louie, were you first due?

                    LOUIE
          Yeah, I radioed you guys right away
          'cause you got two roasts on the top
          floor but you don't hafta investigate
          cause homicide is up there.

                    JORDY
          Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't
          make it a crime scene yet.

                    LOUIE
          Hey, it's Eddie Flemming.

                    KORFIN (O.S.)
          Yo, Jordy!

     BOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick
     with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a
     turnout coat.

                    KORFIN (CONT'D)
          Where you been, man?  We got a
          celebrity!

                    JORDY
          I heard.  Who the hell let them up
          there?

                    KORFIN
          I don't know, you think Eddie will give
          me his autograph?

                    JORDY
          You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody
          suspicious?

                    KORFIN
          Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.

                    JORDY
          Oh yeah, why?

                    KORFIN
          'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by
          now!

     INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins,
     smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by
     what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's
     charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar,
     listening to Leon.

                    LEON
          So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine
          position - that they were doin' each
          other but were so whacked out of their
          heads they set the pipe on the mattress,
          lit it up, and they got fried.  What do
          you think, Eddie?

     Jordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can.

                    EDDIE
          I don't know.  We got the experts here. 
          Show them what you found - I hope you
          don't mind, we came over to see if we
          could help.

     Korfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the
     celebrity.

                    KORFIN
          Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming -
          Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with
          you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.

                    JORDY
          Could you put out the cigar?  Part of
          the job is picking up scents.

                    EDDIE
          Oh, sure.

     Eddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar
     holder and pockets it to finish later.

                    LEON
          Well, I found - check it out - crack
          pipe.  Looks like they got careless.

     Leon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin
     shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          Mind not shining that light in my eyes?

                    KORFIN
          Sorry, bro.

                    JORDY
          Hey, that's great you guys got it all
          wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go
          through the routine?  It gives us
          somethin' to do.

                    EDDIE
          No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?

                    LEON
          No.  Go ahead.

                    JORDY
          Thanks.  Appreciate it.

     Jordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no
     respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie
     rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and
     living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a
     charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes.

                    KORFIN
          Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got
          good patterns - about thirty minutes
          old.

     Jordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white
     rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The
     glove comes out white.

                    JORDY
          Mouth's clean, too.

                    KORFIN
          Clean?

                    JORDY
          Don't blow your nose!

     Jordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          The smoke'll permeate your nostrils -
          burn 'em out.  Let it run.

                    KORFIN
          But you knew that, right?

     Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy
     turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other
     room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor.

                    JORDY
          So the way you see it, two crack heads
          burned themselves up?

                    LEON
          That's what it looks like to me.

                    JORDY
          And while they're burning up, they're
          still goin' down on each other?  You got
          to hand it to them.

                    LEON
               (realizes he's wrong - blows it
                off)
          Yeah, well, some people got their
          priorities straight.

     Leon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy
     pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the
     heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth
     inside.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          What was that?

                    JORDY
          Evidence.  Of a homicide.

     That got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          You know what that is, right?

                    EDDIE
          No, what is it?

                    JORDY
          Why don't you explain it, Bobby.
               (to a fireman joking a wall)
          Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole
          in the floor?

                    CAMELLO
          No problem.
               (to Eddie and Leon)
          Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna
          back up a little more.  Don't wanna get
          your pants wet.

     Leon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV
     set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello
     hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the
     bodies and Korfin explains:

                    KORFIN
          They have not soot in their mouths,
          which means they weren't breathin'
          before the fire and that usually means
          they were deceased - and this piece of
          cloth that my partner found means they
          were wrapped up in something, probably
          doused with a flammable liquid and
          positioned like this on the bed.  To the
          untrained eye, it looks like an
          accident.

     Jordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for
     something.

                    LEON
          What's he looking for?

                    EDDIE
          A timer.

     Jordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up -
     on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from
     Jordy and moves to Eddie.

                    KORFIN
          Here you go.  A big double homicide.

     EXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     As Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is
     arriving.  Jumps out. 
     Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the
     trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in.

                    KORFIN
          You see Eddie's face when I gave him the
          timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.

                    JORDY
          He knew all along.

                    KORFIN
          What??

                    JORDY
          That's why he was so quiet.  He was
          testing us.

     Eddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer
     inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her
     microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected
     by her peers.

                    NICOLETTE
          Detective, does it look like a murder?

                    EDDIE
          We don't know that yet.  It's much too
          early.  There's a lot to be done.

                    NICOLETTE
          How many victims are up there?

                    EDDIE
          There are two bodies found at this
          point.

                    NICOLETTE
          Can we go up to the crime scene?

                    EDDIE
          You know you can't do that.  C'mon.

                    NICOLETTE
          Is it drug related?

                    EDDIE
          We don't know.  When I have more I'll
          let you know.

     Nicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on
     Eddie's hand.  She barrels on...

                    NICOLETTE
          Detective...what's that you're holding
          in your hand?  Evidence?

     Mike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive,
     hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash
     as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in
     the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE
     HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. 
     She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a
     glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the
     crowd - but Daphne is gone.

                    KORFIN
          What?

                    JORDY
          There was a woman - I think she wanted
          to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh
          shit!  Oh no!

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER

     Korfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. 
     Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is
     now NAKED!

                    MUGGER
          You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped
          me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me
          all over, it was disgusting.

     Jordy unlocks the handcuffs.

                    JORDY
          I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

     Korfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          You okay?

                    MUGGER
          A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you
          for this!  You violated my civil rights!

                    JORDY
          Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob
          me!  I could arrest you right now! 
          You're lucky you're walking away from
          this.  Now get outta here.

     Jordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around
     himself cursing - hurrying away.
          

     EXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT

     Exhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a
     sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign.

     INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     The light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into
     the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down
     trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down
     twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he
     angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. 
     He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow
     behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has
     been talking to a FATHER.

                    ROSEANNE (ON T.V.)
          So you slept with your son's wife! 
          What's that all about?

                    FATHER (ON T.V.)
          I take full responsibility for sleepin'
          with my daughter in law.  I had low self
          esteem, I thought I had to compete with
          him.

     Emil reaches for his dictionary.

                    EMIL
               (mutters)
          Self-esteem?  Self-esteem??

     He flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self
     esteem.

                    FATHER (ON T.V.)
          Losin' my job and everything, caused my
          behavioral disorder.
               (turns to his son)
          Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you?

     The audience boos.  Roseanne mediates...

     Oleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed
     in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen -
     rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time -
     as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka
     between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's
     wearing Milos' Rolex. 
     Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl
     earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil
     looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera.

                    EMIL
               (Czech)
          Turn that fucking thing off!

                    OLEG
               (Czech)
          I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos
          die.  It's just like a move but realer.

     Emil grabs the videocamera.
               (Czech)
          Don't break it!  Don't break it!

                    EMIL
          Speak English!

                    OLEG
               (English)
          You said speak Czech!

                    EMIL
          How you erase this?

                    OLEG
          I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!

     Emil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka
     bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the
     camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. 
     Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet.

                    EMIL
          Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill
          him.
               (noticing)
          What's this?

     Emil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a
     picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY
     ESCORTS - and a number.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Worldly escorts?

     Emil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages -
     finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the
     number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the
     background.

                    SEXY VOICE
          Hi?

                    EMIL
          Hello?

                    SEXY VOICE
          Are you looking for companionship?

     Oleg, who's listening, moves to Emil.

                    OLEG
          Whore?

                    EMIL
          I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European
          girl?  A Czech girl?

                    SEXY VOICE
          Matter of fact, I have a lovely Czech
          girl.

                    EMIL
          I take her.  Send her!

     EXT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

     Korfin's car pulls up to the station - as a fire engine is
     returning.

                    JORDY
          Now that you know him, maybe you can get
          extra work in the next movie they make
          about him.

                    KORFIN
          Yeah?

                    JORDY
          Maybe you can be his stand-in.

     INT. FIRE STATION 91 - NIGHT

     The men are pulling off their equipment - coming down from
     the high of fighting a fire.  Korfin and Jordy walk toward
     the TV room.  The TV is on in the background.  We can see
     Nicolette interviewing Eddie.  He holds up the paint can.

                    CHIEF DUFFY (O.S.)
          What the hell is that??  You gave Eddie
          Flemming the evidence?!

     They turn.  DEPUTY CHIEF FIRE MARSHAL DECLAN DUFFY - the head
     of the arson squad - comes over.  Duffy's tough, Irish and
     very political.

                    DUFFY
               (pointing to the TV)
          Who did cause and origin?

                    JORDY
          Who do you think, Chief?!

                    DUFFY
          Then why didn't you talk to the
          reporter?

                    JORDY
          'Cause we got more important things to
          do, like finding out who did it.

     They walk to the back of the station and start up the stairs.

                    DUFFY
          Don't you guys understand?  It's all
          about image.  The better we look the
          more money I get to pay you guys
          overtime.

                    KORFIN
          Yeah, right.

                    DUFFY
          What was that, Korfin?

                    KORFIN
          I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As
          soon as we get somethin' we'll let you
          alert the media.

                    DUFFY
          You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve
          this thing before Eddie Flemming does.

     They all head upstairs.

     INT. ARSON SQUAD ROOM - DAY

     The Chief, Jordy and Korfin enter.  There are posters of
     pyros, arsonists and terrorists on the walls.  GARCIA - a
     Puerto Rican investigator - looks up from his desk.

                    GARCIA
          Hey guys, I got your torch.  He just
          gave a full confession.

     A scruffy, unshaven white man sitting across from Garcia,
     turns.  He is MAX, a pyromaniac in his 40's with a freshly
     scratched cross etched in his forehead.  He craves attention.

                    MAX
          It's my fire!  Screw homicide.  I'll
          tell you guys everything!

     Jordy moves to his desk with Korfin.  They sit across from
     each other.  Duffy keeps going to his office, not even
     bothering to stop.

                    JORDY
          What's that on your forehead, Max? 
          That's a nice attention getter.

                    MAX
          Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist
          like you!  Now, are you guys gonna
          arrest me, or not?

                    JORDY
          How did you start the fire this time?

                    MAX
          I used an accelerant.

                    JORDY
          Yeah?  What kind?

                    MAX
               (to Jordy)
          Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about
          your wife leavin' you.

                    KORFIN
          Max.

                    MAX
               (continuing)
          ...Yeah, and with your old man dying
          last year you - what's it?  Just you and
          the dog now?

                    KORFIN
          Max!  

                    MAX
          Does it feel bad - I mean the new guy
          your ex-wife's seeing - I hear he's a
          big shot downtown.

     Jordy pops out of his seat.

                    JORDY
          That's it!  You're outta here.

     Jordy pulls Max by the collar - pushes him down the aisle.

                    MAX
          That's it.  I'm suing.

                    KORFIN
          Get in line.

     Korfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia
     who is laughing.

                    JORDY
          What's so funny.  How does he know so
          much about me?  Who tells him my life
          story?

                    GARCIA
          He hangs around downstairs.  The guys
          talk to him.  He's a joke...

                    JORDY
          He's no joke!  One day he's gonna
          graduate from trash can fires and do
          something big.

                    GARCIA
          Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the
          station.

     INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT

     As the "Top Story" logo is splashed across the screen,
     accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces
     America's highest rated 'news magazine' show.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and
          this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you
          an exclusive interview with Stephen
          Geller - who horrified the nation two
          years ago when he went berserk and
          murdered three clerks in a Manhattan
          shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's
          claim, spoken softly and articulately,
          is that he is the victim.  According to
          Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful
          day were not his fault but were the
          fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to
          believe...watch.

                    EMIL (O.S.)
          Louder.

     VIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting
     on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Louder.

     Oleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the
     volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being
     interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's
     sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint
     stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the
     background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird
     dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the
     paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson.

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          This had nothing to do with shoes that
          didn't fit or my relationship with my
          father who, as you know, made a fortune
          selling penny loafers in the fifties. 
          These people died because of the
          criminal actions of my doctor.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          Your doctor?

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that
          I stay on my medication.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          ...so you feel absolutely no
          responsibility for killing these people?

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          It was my finger that pulled the
          trigger, but I'm not morally
          responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what
          I was capable of.  How could I know. 
          I'm not a doctor.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          You seem very savvy for a man who's been
          found mentally incompetent to stand
          trial.

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a
          year away from getting my masters in
          Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life
          has been permanently disrupted.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you
          selling paintings now for quite a lot of
          money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you
          call it, jump started your career as an
          artist?

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          Look, I'm in here.  You call this a
          career move?

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          And isn't there a movie in the works
          about you?

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          We're in negotiations, that's correct.

                    ROBERT HAWKINS
          But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent
          criminals from profiting from their
          crimes?

                    STEPHEN GELLER
          That doesn't apply to me because I'm not
          a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I
          wasn't convicted.

     Emil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated.

                    EMIL
          I love America.  No one is responsible
          for what they do.

     There's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over
     to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Get in the bathroom!

                    OLEG (O.S.)
          Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?

                    EMIL
          Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and
          shut up!

     Emil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom,
     closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks
     down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife
     sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants
     cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door
     and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class.

                    HONEY
          Hi, I'm Honey.

                    EMIL
          Where's Czech girl?

                    HONEY
          Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. 
          I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm
          a Czech girl.

     She enters.  Closes the door behind her.

                    HONEY (CONT'D)
          Now I like to get business out of the
          way before we get down to pleasure.  Why
          don'tchya put my money on the dresser.

                    EMIL
          I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you
          know her?

     Oleg ZOOMS in for a CLOSE UP of Honey.  During the rest of
     the scene Oleg films her.  Honey begins to undress.

                    HONEY
          It's an outcall service run out of an
          apartment.  I don't meet the other
          girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?

                    EMIL
          Where is escort service?

                    HONEY
          That's confidential.  Could you put the
          money on the dresser?

                    EMIL
          I like to talk to the person who runs
          the service.  Can you give me address?

                    HONEY
          Look.  Do we have a problem here? 
          There's no reason to have a problem. 
          I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You
          wanna Czech girl? 
          After I'm done with you, you won't miss
          her.  Now why don't you pay me?

     She starts to unfasten Emil's belt.

                    EMIL
               (stopping her)
          Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just
          give me the address and then you go.

                    HONEY
               (suddenly hard as nails)
          Look, man, I don't give a shit if you
          want sex or not, but you're payin' for
          my time.

     Emil pulls the knife out of his boot and SHOVES her against
     the door, PUSHING the blade against her throat - suddenly
     furious like he was before killing Milos and Tamina.

                    EMIL
          Give me the address!!

                    HONEY
          Alright, alright - don't hurt me! 
          Please, it's in my book, in my purse!

     Emil backs off as she reaches for her purse, and comes out
     with a can of mace, SPRAYING Emil's face!

     Emil stumbles backwards - Oleg holding him in the frame.  He
     WHIP PANS back to Honey as she grabs her clothes, unlocking
     the door but Emil's HAND SLAMS it shut!  Emil turns blindly,
     rubbing his burning eyes - guarding the door.  Honey darts
     toward the bathroom - she pushes open the door and runs into
     Oleg who is VIDEOTAPING HER.  Horrified, she turns around as
     Emil SMASHES her in the face so hard she topples backwards,
     tripping into the bathtub, pulling the shower curtain down on
     her!  Like a panther out for the kill, Emil POUNCES.  Oleg
     films as Emil lifts his hand, gripping...

     THE KITCHEN KNIFE

     As Emil's hand comes FLYING DOWN - then RISES UP, BLOODIED. 
     Her screams are muffled by the shower curtain wrapped around
     her face.  Oleg films the scene as the knife plunges DOWN
     INTO:
          
          INT. FIRE STATION 91 - ARSON SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

     DAPHNE, a sketch of her face.

                    JORDY (O.S.)
          Her lips are fuller than that.  You can
          see 'em a mile away.

     WIDER

     Food containers are scattered all over the place.  The female
     COMPOSITE ARTIST looks at Jordy.  Stacks of failed sketches
     sit beside her.

                    COMPOSITE ARTIST
          What about her cheek bones?

                    JORDY
          Her cheek bones are prominent and her
          eyes were huge.  Big, blue eyes and when
          I saw her, she looked scared.  Like she
          was looking to get away.  But she was
          absolutely beautiful.

     The composite artist looks at Jordy.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          I gotta good look at her.

     Korfin has his chair turned around from his desk and is
     watching the sketch evolve as he speaks on the phone to the
     landlord of the 7th Street brownstone.  Garcia is also on the
     phone.  The other investigators are gone.  Working late into
     the night.  Everybody's exhausted.  It's almost dawn.

                    KORFIN
          -- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long
          have they been livin' in your building?  
               (writes 4 YEARS on his pad)
          Alright, I'll be in touch when we know
          somethin'.
               (to Jordy)
          Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were
          quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord
          don't know who your girl is.

                    JORDY
          How long they been livin' here?

                    KORFIN
          You hear that question, Garcia?

                    GARCIA
          Yeah, I got Immigration on the phone -
          they've been here illegally.

                    KORFIN
          Well, they're definitely permanent
          residents now.

                    GARCIA
          I got the owner of the plumbing company
          Milos worked for.

                    KORFIN
          Why don't we get some sleep and we'll go
          see him in the morning.

                    JORDY
          You go home.  I'm takin' your car and
          goin' back to the crime scene.

                    KORFIN
          Aren't you tired?

                    JORDY
          If I go home I won't be able to fall
          asleep anyway.

     Jordy takes the sketch of Daphne which isn't a bad likeness
     and heads for the door.  Korfin falls in behind him.  As they
     pass Garcia he hands Jordy the address.

                    KORFIN
               (of the picture)
          She keepin' you up?  Like to meet her,
          huh?  She'd make you forget your ex
          wife.  Cure your insomnia.

     INT. MILOS' APARTMENT - DAWN

     CAMERA DESCENDS FROM THE SKY picking up Jordy as he enters
     what is left of Milos and Tamina's apartment.  The roof has
     been burned off. He moves into the next room, trying to see
     through the darkness - looking through the muck and char.

                    EDDIE
          Okay to smoke?

     Jordy turns, surprised.  Eddie sits on a singed chair.  He
     pours from a half-pint bottle of vodka into his 'won ton
     soup' container, smoking a cigar.  On the arm of the armchair
     is a brown legal folder and stacks of photographs of the
     crime scene and the burned bodies.

                    JORDY
          It's your crime scene now.  You can do
          what you want.

                    EDDIE
          Watch the news?

                    JORDY
          Nah, I musta missed it.

                    EDDIE
          Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys
          the credit.

                    JORDY
          Well, just so you know, I don't care
          about that stuff.

                    EDDIE
          Nah, why should you?

                    JORDY
          I don't even watch TV.

                    EDDIE
          Good.  Good.  Commendable.

     Eddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back.

                    JORDY
          Did you get a report from the M.E.?

                    EDDIE
          Sure.  But I would like to ask you
          something.  You got a problem with me?

                    JORDY
          If you found me steppin' on your crime
          scene - it might piss you off, too.
               (then)
          What about the report?

                    EDDIE
          You were right, they were both dead
          before the fire.  The male was stabbed
          so hard the killer broke off the tip of
          the knife in his spine.  That's usually
          an indicator of something personal.

     Jordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie.

                    JORDY
          The Super said he'd seen her before but
          she didn't live here.

                    EDDIE
          Pretty.

                    JORDY
               (acts as if he didn't notice)
          Hmmmm.

                    EDDIE
          Maybe you don't care about that either.
               (beat)
          Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.

                    JORDY
          Who says she's a suspect?

     Jordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on.

                    EDDIE
          What would you call her?

                    JORDY
          Look, I'm not even sure she has anything
          to do with this.  I saw her outside
          after the fire - thought it was a lead. 
          Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was
          visiting somebody here.  Who knows?

     Eddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were.

                    EDDIE
          Obviously they weren't having sex.  As
          you pointed out.  So why go through all
          the trouble of putting 'em like that?

     Eddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy.

                    JORDY
          Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone
          trying to send a message.  Burial rites
          are taken very seriously in Eastern
          Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. 
          Just burning them up, no proper funeral,
          it's like condemning them to hell.

                    EDDIE
          Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? 
          Hungary?

                    JORDY
          Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been
          fighting the Germans and the Russians
          for a thousand years.  These are very
          intense people and they take things
          personally.

     Eddie's cellular rings - he grabs it.

                    EDDIE
          Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? 
          Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay.
               (to Jordy)
          We've got another murder - in a hotel on
          Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said
          the room was rented by a Russian...

     Eddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. 

                    JORDY
          I'll come with you.

                    EDDIE
          There wasn't a fire.  There'll be
          nothing for you to do.

                    JORDY
          I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll
          learn something.

                    EDDIE
          This isn't homicide school.

                    JORDY
          My parents are from Poland.  I can help
          with the Eastern European angle.

                    EDDIE
          You're Polish?

                    JORDY
          My folks are.

                    EDDIE
          Stay here.
                              

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY

     Video POV of the news stand as a hand reaches into frame and
     picks up a copy of THE NEW YORK POST.  Eddie's photo is on
     the front page - holding the kitchen timer by the wires. 
     Underneath his picture the caption reads, "DOUBLE HOMICIDE...
     FLEMMING'S ON IT."  The videocamera widens out revealing Emil
     standing in front of a Times Square news stand, reading the
     front page.  The videocamera turns around - until focusing on
     Oleg himself.

                    OLEG
          This is second day in America.  First
          day was very exciting.  Full of thrills
          and chills.  Over there, is co-star of
          my new movie, Emil!

     He turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL.

                    EMIL
               (to vendor)
          Who is he?

                    VENDOR
          New York's finest.  This is his case.

     The VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the
     cover.

                    VENDOR (CONT'D)
          This all you want?  

                    EMIL
          Do you know how much killer gets for
          movie rights?

                    VENDOR
               (People)
          In here, says he wants a million.

                    EMIL
          Million?!  The killer gets one million
          dollars for a television interview?

                    VENDOR
          Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous
          serial killer - half a million for his
          interview.  And how much you think
          Monica got for writing book about the
          President coming on to her?  It pays to
          be a killer or a whore in this country. 
          Look, you want magazine or not?

                    EMIL
          Yes.  Both.

                    OLEG
          And these.

     Oleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. 
     Emil pays for everything.

                    EMIL
               (to Oleg)
          Get a taxi.

     Oleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases
     and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old
     BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light's blinking
     WALK.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Let me help.

     Emil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side.

                    BLIND WOMAN
          Thank you, son.

     Emil watches her walk on.

     INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY

     The hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the
     dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and
     putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie
     enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in
     the doorway taking pictures.

                    EDDIE
          Where is she?

                    LEON
          Takin' a bath.

                    EDDIE
          Any I.D.?

                    LEON
          Still unknown but we're running prints. 
          Kid over there caught the case.

     Jordy enters.  Leon steps in his way.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          Sorry...PD only.

                    EDDIE
          It's okay.

     Eddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only
     26, is excited to meet Eddie.

                    TOMMY
          Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. 
          Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got. 
          A girl in there, figure her to be a
          prostitute, looks like she was fighting
          for her life.  She's got defense wounds
          on her hands.  Right this way - in the
          bathroom.

                    EDDIE
          After you.

     Eddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There's blood
     splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey's topless
     body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. 
     MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the
     body.

                    TOMMY
          Room was registered to a Francis Capra.

                    JORDY
          Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. 
          Who said he sounded Russian?

                    TOMMY
          The clerk?

                    EDDIE
          Check the switchboard, see what phone
          calls were made from this room.

                    TOMMY
          I'll do it.

     Tommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides
     out what's left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at
     Honey's body in the bathtub.  Gil's dusting the tub for
     prints.

                    MURPHY
          Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub
          is dry except for the blood.

                    EDDIE
          Any of you guys take a piss lately?

     Gil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Do the seat for me.

     Gil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie
     stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the
     unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Only one guys checked in?

                    LEON
          Yeah.

                    EDDIE
          C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide
          school?  Here - make yourself useful.

     Eddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Our killer...our killer's standing here
          slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. 
          The blood is splattering this way.  It's
          on this wall...
               (pointing to the right of
                Jordy)
          And there's some specks over here.
               (to the left of Jordy)
          There's nothing here because someone was
          standing right here.  Someone big.  And
          he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. 
          He wouldn't walk out of here like that.
               (turning to Murphy)
          Murphy, what kind of knife you think
          we're talking about here?

     Murphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the
     blood-splattered wall.

                    MURPHY
          If you look here where he missed and hit
          the wall you see that the marks aren't
          deep but they're kinda wide... not your
          everyday kitchen or pocket knife.

                    EDDIE
          What if the tip was broken off?

                    MURPHY
          Could be.  Then we should find it here
          somewhere.

                    EDDIE
          I think we've already found it.

     Eddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young
     detective, returns.

                    TOMMY
          There was only one call from this room
          last night.  I dialed it.  It's an
          escort service.

                    LEON
          Did you identify yourself?

                    TOMMY
          Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid.

                    EDDIE
          Call communications and get an address
          on that number.

     Tommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service
     address on it.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Good work.

     INT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

     Jordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie.

                    JORDY
          You goin' to the escort service?

                    EDDIE
          You got any better ideas?

                    JORDY
          Mind if I ride along with you?

                    EDDIE
          This has nothing to do with your fire.

                    JORDY
          But what if it does?  You might need my
          help.

     As Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches.

                    MAN
          Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for
          my son?

     EXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY

     Jordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using
     the man's back.

                    EDDIE
          I'll let you know what happens.

                    JORDY
          This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in
          your way - we can talk the case over.

                    EDDIE
          Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. 
          If you win you can come with me.  If you
          don't win, you don't come.

                    JORDY
          I'll call it... tails.

     Eddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy.

                    EDDIE
          Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads.

     Jordy flips the coin and it's heads.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Heads.  See, you lost twice.
               (beat)
          Okay.  Get in.

     Jordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy
     can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the
     sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time
     lets Jordy get in.


                    WHIP PAN TO:

     INT. UPPER EASTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

     Eddie and Jordy arrive in front of Rose's door.  Eddie knocks
     and flips a coin to Jordy.

                    EDDIE
          Oh here.  A souvenir.

     Jordy takes the quarter.  Not understanding what Eddie means. 
     He looks at the quarter.

                    JORDY
          Two heads.

                    EDDIE
          Better than one.

     Eddie suckered him with the coin toss.  Jordy reacts.  Eddie
     laughs - squirts Binaca in his mouth.  Knocks again.  We hear
     ROSE HELLER.

                    ROSE (O.S.)
          Who's there?

                    EDDIE
          Police.  We'd like to ask you a few
          questions.

                    ROSE (O.S.)
          I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna
          contact my attorney...

                    EDDIE
               (commands)
          Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective
          Eddie Flemming.  Open up.

     Rose reacts.  Immediately UNLOCKS, UNCHAINS and opens the
     door!  

                    ROSE
          You!  I've seen you on TV!

     Eddie glances self-consciously at Jordy.

                    ROSE (CONT'D)
          C'mon in.  C'mon in!

     INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     They enter.

                    ROSE
          Just a minute.  Shit.  And I don't have
          a camera.  Hold on a second.

     Rose moves back to the phone - finishes up her conversation
     in Afrikaner.  We hold on Eddie and Jordy at the door.  Eddie
     looks around - taking in the place.  FOUR GIRLS are on
     phones.  Two girls take orders for customers.  The other two
     work the phone sex lines.  Rose hangs up the phone - turns to
     Eddie and Jordy:

                    ROSE (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

                    EDDIE
          We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of
          your girls was killed last night at the
          King Edward Hotel.

                    ROSE
          Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?

                    JORDY
          Do you remember the man who called?

     Though Rose answers Jordy, she directs her response to Eddie.

                    ROSE
          Yeah.  He wanted a girl from
          Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey
          'cause once they get there, you know, it
          doesn't really matter - Honey was
          killed...?  Poor girl...

                    EDDIE
          Do you have any Czech girls working for
          you?

                    ROSE
          No.

                    EDDIE
          Did you tell him you did?

     A BUTCH GIRL enters.  Rose speaks to her in Afrikaner.

                    ROSE
               (Afrikaner)
          Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.

                    EDDIE
          What are you saying?

                    ROSE
          Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me
          about her, too.

     Jordy pulls out the sketch, unfolds it.

                    JORDY
          This her?

                    ROSE
          Yeah.  Sort of.  I tried to recruit her,
          gave her my card.  She said she'd think
          about it but I never heard from her.

                    BUTCH GIRL
               (Afrikaner)
          Beautiful eyes.

                    EDDIE
          Who came by looking for her?

                    ROSE
          He said he was her cousin.  I told him
          where she works.  They were just here.

                    EDDIE
          Describe him.

                    ROSE
          Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second
          guy with him was...shorter, with a
          wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn
          his videocamera off me.

                    EDDIE
          He had a videocamera?  Where is she? 
          Quickly!

                    ROSE
          She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon
          on 63rd and Madison.

     EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

     As Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

     Jordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with
     astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up
     his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well.

                    EDDIE
          Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. 
          Hair salon.  Ludwig's. 

                    JORDY
               (overlapping)
          I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 
          63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be
          there already.

     Eddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer
     he was holding between his legs - finishes it.

                    EDDIE
          You thirsty?

                    JORDY
          I'm on duty.

                    EDDIE
               (drinking)
          So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and
          you cover the back.

                    JORDY
          Of course.

                    EDDIE
          Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I
          was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a
          door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and
          yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! 
          What'd you dream about?

                    JORDY
          I wanted to run up to a building on
          fire, kick in the door, rush into the
          smoke and save a kid.

                    EDDIE
          Then I guess we're doin' this the right
          way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a
          burning building I'll gladly let you go
          first.

     Jordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right.

     INT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY

     We're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon -
     it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST.

                    OLEG (O.S.)
          Daphne Handlova?

                    RECEPTIONIST
          Daphne?  In the back.  Probably
          shampooing a customer's hair.

     Oleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the
     owner, is with her.

                    LUDWIG
          Why are you messing with your hair color
          again?  You're going to kill your hair. 
          You won't look good with black hair.

                    DAPHNE
          I want to do it, alright?

                    LUDWIG
          Well, then do it after work.  A
          customer's waiting.

     He leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns
     on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She
     backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door!

     TO THE BACKYARD

     There's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. 
     Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the
     corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen
     knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with
     the broken tip against her throat.

                    EMIL
          I...I have a temper.

     She looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          When I lose it, I lose control.  I
          didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole
          from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to
          prison, they beat me.  I still didn't
          tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos
          like a brother...

     The tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic
     softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
               (in English)
          I'm not a killer.

     The back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as
     Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil
     leaning close to Daphne, kissing her.

                    LUDWIG
          Daphne, will you be coming back to work?

                    DAPHNE
          In a minute, Ludwig.

     Ludwig leaves.

                    EMIL
          Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a
          whore.  But washing hair?  This is no
          job for a woman as beautiful as you. 
          They should be washing your hair.

     Emil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks
     it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          I don't want to kill you.  But if you
          talk, I will.
               (whispers)
          I thought you'd want these.

     He taps her hand...he turns and goes out the rear exit.  Oleg
     follows.  Jordy arrives.

                    JORDY
          ...Daphne?

     She says nothing.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          I'm a fire marshal.  You remember me
          from the other night?  You are Daphne,
          right?

     She says nothing.  Eddie arrives.  Daphne turns.  Recognizing
     Eddie.

                    EDDIE
          You don't have to be afraid.  We're here
          to protect you.  Come with me.  We want
          to talk to you.  You speak English
          alright?

     Eddie looks at Jordy.  Takes Daphne by the arm.
          
          EXT. LUDWIG'S SALON - CONTINUOUS

     As they come out, Eddie notices Daphne clutching something in
     her hand.  He reaches for her hand.  Opens it.  It's a
     brushed gold necklace.

                    EDDIE
          Did he give you these?  Was he just
          here?

     Eddie searches the streets.  Notices Oleg and Emil on the far
     corner.  Oleg is videotaping him.  Leon and Tommy pull up. 
     Korfin behind.  They all pop out.  Eddie grabs Leon -
     squeezes his arm - quietly.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          The other side of the street.  The guy
          with the videocamera.
               (back to Jordy)
          Don't look - put her in the car.
               (to Leon)
          Stay this side.

                    LEON
               (back to Tommy)
          Stay with her.

     They start heading down the curb - trying not to attract the
     attention of Oleg and Emil.

     A VIDEO CLOSE-UP

     of the scene from across the corner.

                    EMIL
               (Czech)
          Put the fuckin' camera down!  Let's go!

     Emil starts to flee.

     EXT. NYC STREETS - CONTINUOUS

     What follows next is an incredible foot chase with Eddie,
     Jordy, Korfin and Leon running through traffic - chasing
     Emil.  Eddie tries to stay in the lead but is running out of
     breath.

                    EDDIE
          Split up!

     Jordy runs down one side of Madison - Eddie, the other. 
     Korfin continues down 62nd and Leon covers the other side. 
     They search for Emil, grabbing people, turning them around,
     missing him.  Emil seems to have disappeared.

     Leon, gun raised, approaches the cafe.  As he rounds the
     corner, Emil darts out, cracking Leon across the face!  Leon
     crashes into a table, dropping his gun.  Emil scoops up the
     gun and PISTOL-WHIPS Leon.  BEATING the detective to a pulp. 
     People are running from the scene.  Emil takes Leon's wallet. 
     He is distracted by LAUGHTER.  Oleg is VIDEOTAPING the scene.

                    OLEG
          Emil, look!

     Oleg swivels with the videocamera.  Korfin is running toward
     them - pushing through the crowd.  Emil FIRES!  Korfin is
     blown backwards.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          Perfect!  Cut.  Print!

     Eddie arrives.  Bends down to Leon, whose face is red with
     blood.  Jordy runs to Korfin, who's laying in the street,
     shot in the side.  Jordy cradles his partner.

                    EDDIE
          Are you hit?

                    LEON
          No.  I'm okay.

                    JORDY
               (to Korfin)
          Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!

                    KORFIN
          It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!

                    JORDY
          Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.

     Jordy looks up as Eddie steps into the center of the street. 
     Cars screech out of the way!  Eddie crouches, taking aim at
     Emil, who is almost two blocks away.  It's an impossible
     shot, out of range.

     But Eddie closes an eye, aims and squeezes off one SHOT.  Two
     blocks away, Emil topples.  Korfin and Jordy look at Eddie,
     astonished he made the shot.  Emil scrambles to his feet. 
     Runs.  Eddie holsters his weapon.  Pulls out a handkerchief. 
     Dabs Leon's wounds.

                    LEON
          He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming
          the whole time!

                    EDDIE
          I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't
          worry, we'll get those fuckers.
                              

                    DISSOLVE TO:

     EMS VEHICLE

     Eddie and Jordy watch as Korfin on a stretcher, is loaded in
     an EMS VEHICLE and in b.g., an EMS DOCTOR attends to Leon's
     bloody face.  Eddie and Jordy turn to go back into the
     restaurant, now cleared out - as Nicolette Karas arrives with
     her cameraman.

                    NICOLETTE
          Detective - can you tell us what
          happened here?

                    EDDIE
          I can't talk right now.  We have some
          things to take care of.

     Jordy moves off, he doesn't want to get pulled in front of
     Nicolette.

     Daphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant,
     maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is
     where Eddie and Jordy are headed.

                    NICOLETTE
          I understand, but I noticed that the
          Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this
          somehow related to the fire department?

                    EDDIE
          I really can't give out any information
          right now at this point.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.  But I do understand that your
          partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. 
          Is that correct?

                    EDDIE
          He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll
          be fine.

                    NICOLETTE
          Do you have the suspect in custody?

                    EDDIE
          Um...now is not a good time, okay. 
          Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. 
          I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective
          Jackson is hurt but not seriously.

                    NICOLETTE
               (to cameraman)
          Alright, cut, cut, cut.

     Mike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his
     shoulder.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
               (to Eddie)
          Eddie, are you okay?

                    EDDIE
          Yeah.  Now's not a good time.

                    NICOLETTE
          Alright.

                    EDDIE
          Alright?

                    NICOLETTE
          Alright.

                    EDDIE
          Alright.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.

     Eddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her,
     then enters.

     INT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jordy talks to Daphne. 

                    DAPHNE
          I told your partner, I can't help.  I
          didn't see anything.

                    EDDIE
          C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know
          these people?

                    DAPHNE
          Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower
          was broken, she let me use theirs.

                    EDDIE
          Go on.

     She says nothing.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Whether you tell us or not, we'll find
          out.  Better if it comes from you.

                    DAPHNE
          If I tell you, will you arrest me?

                    EDDIE
          Arrest you for what?  Why would we
          arrest you?

     She still hesitates.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid

                    JORDY
          She just saw two of her friends killed! 
          They probably threatened her.

                    EDDIE
          Is that all there is?

     She looks at Eddie.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Are you here illegally?  Don't worry
          about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. 
          They won't deport you.

                    DAPHNE
          No, no, don't talk to Immigration!

     She clams up.

                    JORDY
          Why not?

                    EDDIE
          Something back home?

     Jordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across
     from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her.

                    DAPHNE
          ...my little sister and I shared a flat -
          I came home one night and a man was
          raping her.  His gun was on the chair...
          He came at me and I shot him.

                    JORDY
               (optimistic)
          Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.

                    DAPHNE
          Yes, but he was a cop.

                    EDDIE
          A cop?

                    DAPHNE
               (beat)
          I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like
          the South here.  The Police is right, a
          civilian is wrong.  So I fled.

                    EDDIE
          Look, we can help you but right now we
          have to deal with what's happening here. 
          Tell us the truth...is that the truth?

                    DAPHNE
          You're a cop - you'll never believe me.

                    JORDY
               (to Eddie)
          Can I talk to you?

     Eddie steps away with Jordy.  Keeping his eyes on Daphne. 
     She tries to listen.

                    EDDIE
          She's fucked.  Even if that story is
          true.

                    JORDY
          Raw deal.

     Eddie tilts his head.  Measures Jordy.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I
          get, they're all yours.  Just let me
          have a first crack at her.

                    EDDIE
          You wanna talk to her alone?

                    JORDY
          Yeah.

                    EDDIE
          What would your girlfriend think of
          that?

                    JORDY
          I don't have a girlfriend.

                    EDDIE
          My point exactly.

                    JORDY
          I'm serious here.

                    EDDIE
          So am I.

                    JORDY
          C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're
          a celebrity.  She sees me differently.

                    EDDIE
          You're her Savior?  Is she the kid
          you're gonna save from the burning
          building?

                    JORDY
          You know what I'm saying here.

     Eddie looks at his watch.  Thinks it over.  Measures Jordy.

                    EDDIE
          Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a
          head start.  You take her to the station
          house.  Don't let her out of your sight. 
          She's the only warm body we got left.

                    JORDY
          Hey.  I'm a professional.

                    EDDIE
          Women like that have a way of turning
          professionals into amateurs.

     He gives Jordy a look and heads for the door.

     INT. A SEEDY BATHROOM - DAY

     Emil pulls off his sock and shoe, lifts his foot into a
     stained sink and washes the blood away, exposing the chunk of
     pink flesh taken out of his ankle.  Emil grabs some toilet
     paper, plugs the wound, then cuts the towel off the dispenser
     with his kitchen knife and wraps his ankle.  He grits teeth
     in pain.  The lights go out.  Then Oleg adjusts the
     fluorescent light above the sink.

                    OLEG
          Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's
          more moody... like a scene from THE
          THIRD MAN.

                    EMIL
          Shut up.

                    OLEG
          Does it hurt?

     Emil lifts his foot out of the sink.

                    EMIL
          This is nothing.

     Emil lifts his shirt, exposing his back.

                    OLEG
          Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!

                    EMIL
          Don't want to film this?

     We don't see what Oleg sees - not yet - but from his
     expression, it's horrible.

     INT. JORDY'S CAR - DAY

     Daphne rides in the backseat.  Jordy's watching her in the
     rearview.

                    DAPHNE
          Now I become custody of police
          department?

                    JORDY
          If you cooperate with the DA - maybe
          they'll help you with your situation.

                    DAPHNE
          I will if they don't send me back.

                    JORDY
          They won't until this is over.

     She looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling
     her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up.

                    DAPHNE
          Are you married?

                    JORDY
          Divorced.

                    DAPHNE
          Do you live alone?
               (beat)
          I've been in these clothes since...the
          killings.  Could we stop at your place? 
          I could take a shower...before I go into
          custody?

     Jordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to
     manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before
     all the shit starts.

                    JORDY
          I can't take you to my place.

                    DAPHNE
          Somewhere else?

     Jordy looks at her...
          

     EDDIE

     Staring right at us.

                    EDDIE
          I want to talk to you about something
          serious.

     He holds up the diamond engagement ring.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          I want to live the rest of my life with
          you...I don't know you've been married
          before and I've never been married, but
          I do love you, and...

     Eddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the
     proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. 
     Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka
     tonic.

                    PAULIE
          She's here.

     Paulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. 
     He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and
     hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps
     Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his
     coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens
     himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the
     drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie
     hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he
     exits.  Paulie follows.

     INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

     It's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a
     table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under
     the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. 
     Gives him a kiss on the cheek.

                    NICOLETTE
          Hey, honey.

                    EDDIE
          Hey.

     She orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits
     down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look
     at each other.

                    NICOLETTE
          What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at
          me?  I just wanted a statement.

                    EDDIE
          I can't...I can't answer you just
          because you want me to answer you!

                    NICOLETTE
          You didn't have to embarrass me in front
          of my colleagues.  You could give me
          something.

                    EDDIE
          Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you,
          sweetheart?  Oh...

                    NICOLETTE
          Stop it.

                    EDDIE
          Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to
          the cameras and say, do you mind if we
          just work something out?

                    NICOLETTE
          Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't
          patronize me.

                    EDDIE
          I'm not.

                    NICOLETTE
          Yes you are.  I'm not just some
          reporter.  I don't just stick a
          microphone in your face.  You could give
          me something.

                    EDDIE
          Yeah, well you took the camera and put
          it right down on the evidence.  That
          was...

                    NICOLETTE
          That was good.  You were holding the
          evidence.

                    EDDIE
          You were merciless.  You didn't give a
          shit if you got me or not.

                    NICOLETTE
          Well, who was it that taught me how to
          do that?  Huh?

                    EDDIE
          You're ruthless.

                    NICOLETTE
          You're not so bad yourself.

     They look at each other.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          C'mere.

     They kiss.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Look at this.  You have blood on your
          shirt.  Whose is it?

                    EDDIE
          Could be Leon's.

                    NICOLETTE
          Jesus.  And last week you came over with
          blood on your shoes.  What am I going to
          do with you?

     Eddie takes her hand.

                    EDDIE
          You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes
          might look nice with another pair of
          shoes next to them in the closet.

     She looks at him.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          You know, Nicky, I've been married twice
          before.  My first wife was a
          professional woman, didn't have time for
          children.  My second wife...I never
          wanted to go home to her.

     Nicolette's phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing
     phone.

                    NICOLETTE
          What are you doing?  What are you
          saying?

     Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Eddie?

     Nicolette's phone keeps ringing.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Don't worry about the damn phone.  I
          won't answer it.

                    EDDIE
          Answer the phone.

                    NICOLETTE
          No.  Tell me what you want to say.

                    EDDIE
          Answer it.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for
          a second.  They only call me when it's
          an emergency.  Just hold that thought.
               (into the phone)
          Can you call back?

                    PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
          We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get
          in a cab.

                    NICOLETTE
          What're you talking about?

                    PHONE VOICE (O.S.)
          Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We
          can't find her.  You gotta anchor the
          5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now.

                    NICOLETTE
          What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah.

     The line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to
     Eddie.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They
          want me to anchor tonight!

                    EDDIE
          That's good.

                    NICOLETTE
          Yeah.

                    EDDIE
          Well, that's great.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go
          now, we're in the middle of something
          here.

                    EDDIE
          No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.

                    NICOLETTE
          No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to
          know what you're talking about.  You
          know, the shoe thing and the marriages
          and...

                    EDDIE
          I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it
          tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll
          talk.  We'll talk.

                    NICOLETTE
          Promise?

                    EDDIE
          I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be
          great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just
          imagine that, uh... Just look into the
          lens and imagine you're talking to me.

                    NICOLETTE
          Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're
          not patronizing me.

                    EDDIE
          Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.

                    NICOLETTE
          I love you.

     They kiss.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Okay, til tonight.

                    EDDIE
          Tonight.

                    NICOLETTE
          You promise?

                    EDDIE
          Yeah.  I promise.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by
          my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes
          and maybe just test them out next to
          yours...How's that... Would that be a
          good thing.

                    EDDIE
          Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.

                    NICOLETTE
          Okay.

                    EDDIE
          See you later.  Good luck.

                    NICOLETTE
          Thank you.

                    EDDIE
          Don't be late.

     She walks out.

     INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY

     Jordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire
     station is empty.

                    JORDY
          The men are out of quarters - practicing
          putting out fires.

                    DAPHNE
          So...the station is empty?

                    JORDY
          Yeah.  This way.

     He gestures toward the stairs.

     INT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes
     never leaving Jordy's.

                    JORDY
          You considered becoming a prostitute?

                    DAPHNE
          Yes, I considered it.

                    JORDY
          Did you ever turn tricks before?

                    DAPHNE
          No.

                    JORDY
          What about back home?

                    DAPHNE
          No.

     Daphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close.

                    DAPHNE (CONT'D)
          I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no
          one.  I couldn't get a job because you
          have to have a green card to get work. 
          They approached me - I could've made a
          lot of money.  I considered it, but...
          it's not who I am.  They pay me below
          the table at Ludwig's.

                    JORDY
          So you were never a prostitute?

                    DAPHNE
          What are you asking me?

                    JORDY
          I'm just trying to find out who you are.

     She looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's
     hinting.

                    DAPHNE
          Can you let me go?

     She leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to
     kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning
     and backs up slightly.

                    JORDY
          Showers are this way.

     Desperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even
     closer.

                    DAPHNE
          You could shower with me.

     Jordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks
     away.  Gestures towards the showers. 
     Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the
     showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are
     lined with shower stalls.

                    JORDY
          I'll uh, I'll get you a towel.

     He leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the
     window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the
     street.

     JORDY

     gets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He
     checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We
     follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he
     notices the window.  It's open.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Shit!

     He rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns -
     looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through
     the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over -
     quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain
     aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding
     herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Are you alright?

     Jordy sits on the bench next to the shower.

                    DAPHNE
          I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.

                    JORDY
          I know.

                    DAPHNE
          You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was
          desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a
          cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to
          me when I got to prison?

                    JORDY
          They're not gonna send you right back.

                    DAPHNE
          I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. 
          Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this
          time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look
          anyone in the eyes. 
          Always afraid that someone would find
          out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...

     He covers her with the towel, pulling her up.

                    JORDY
          You can trust me.

     She embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a
     moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her.
          
          INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY

     CLOSE UP

     on a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets
     down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands
     abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls
     back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is
     taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his
     teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed
     over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews
     them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a
     beer.

     Emil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the
     "People" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. 
     Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the
     videocamera tilts back up to his face.

                    OLEG
          What is it?

                    EMIL
          The video of Milos and Tamina - I told
          you to erase it.

                    OLEG
          I did.

                    EMIL
          And the whore's murder?  You didn't
          erase that either, did you?  Don't lie,
          I won't be angry.

                    OLEG
          Why not?

                    EMIL
          Put the camera down, Oleg.

     Oleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil
     removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks
     up Eddie Flemming's name.

                    OLEG
          What is that?

                    EMIL
          What does it look like?  It's an address
          book!

     Oleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book.

                    OLEG
          Let me get a shot of it.

                    EMIL
          Sit down!

                    OLEG
          This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.

     Oleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          Why won't you be angry at me for keeping
          my movie?

     Emil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps
     away.  Oleg follows.
          

     INT. PRECINCT - DAY

     It's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's
     desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more
     aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting
     Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns
     and sees Jordy and Daphne.

                    DUFFY
          Hey.  Warsaw.

     Jordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench.

                    JORDY
          Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?

                    DUFFY
          I came to see how the investigation was
          going.
               (looks at Daphne)
          I called and you're not here.  I wait up
          at the station and you don't even show
          up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my
          call.  Where the hell have you been?!

     Jordy takes a few steps away from Daphne.

                    JORDY
          Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. 
          We stopped there... so she could get
          cleaned up.

                    DUFFY
          What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'

                    JORDY
          I let her take a shower.

                    DUFFY
          A shower!?  Did you take one, too?

                    JORDY
          No!  Nothing happened.

                    DUFFY
          Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a
          homicide witness to take a shower after
          your partner was shot?  Are you out of
          your fucking mind??  Are you having that
          much trouble gettin' dates?!

                    EDDIE (O.S.)
          I told him to take her there.

     Jordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy -
     the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward
     Hotel - is coming out of the back office.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Tommy, get her outta here.

     Tommy takes Daphne into the precinct.

                    TOMMY
          This way, ma'am.

                    EDDIE
          There was too much press hangin' around
          there.  I didn't want her face on the
          news.  So I told him to take her to a
          quiet area until things settled down.

                    DUFFY
          Oh.

                    EDDIE
          It was my decision, not his.

                    DUFFY
          Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall
          and every now and then I'd like to be
          included in decisions.

                    EDDIE
          Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do
          the press conference.  How about that? 
          The case is all yours.

                    DUFFY
          Oh yeah...?  Alright.

                    EDDIE
               (to Jordy)
          I'm ready to be briefed.
               (to Duffy)
          Excuse us.

                    DUFFY
               (to Eddie)
          Yeah, sure.
               (to Jordy)
          Beep me when you're ready for the press
          conference.

                    JORDY
          Will do, Chief.

     Eddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk -
     toward the back and to his office.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Eddie, I...

     Eddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy.

                    EDDIE
          Wait.

     INT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY

     A handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. 
     Eddie enters with Jordy.

                    EDDIE
          Guys...give me a few minutes?

     They empty out.

                    JORDY
          Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't
          touch her.

                    EDDIE
          Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna
          believe you didn't...including me.

                    JORDY
          I took her there for a shower and that's
          it.

                    EDDIE
          Just a shower?

     Eddie gives Jordy a questioning look.

                    JORDY
          Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing
          happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably
          think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but...

                    EDDIE
          No, I don't think you were a fool, I
          just think you were stupid about it.  I
          mean, to say the least, you outta know
          better.  You don't know her well enough. 
          She's got the potential to fucking hang
          you even if she suggests that you made a
          pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can
          deny it all you want, but it will not
          make one fucking bit of difference. 
          You're dead.

                    JORDY
          I told you, you know, I thought I was
          doing the right thing, you know, I think
          she's innocent.

                    EDDIE
          Well, it's not up to you to decide
          whether she's innocent or not.  Don't
          you understand, that's why you're a
          professional.

                    JORDY
          But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a
          limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda
          heard her there.  Tellin' her whole
          story...I believed her.

                    EDDIE
          How you go out on a limb for somebody is
          by giving her a number of an Immigration
          lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an
          Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help
          her. 
          But you can't get involved in her like
          that.  You're gonna jeopardize your
          career, your life and you're gonna
          jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you
          another piece of advice.  Maybe you
          don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a
          little secret - the whole fuckin' world
          watches television.  And when you get
          out there, they know your face.  And the
          little fame, the little fuckin' itty
          bitty fame that I get in this city makes
          it a lot easier for my job.  And I get
          more done because of it.

     Jordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat.

                    JORDY
          Why'd you help me back there with the
          Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like
          that?

                    EDDIE
          You know, I don't know.  I like you. 
          You remind me of a puppy I used to have. 
          He pissed on the rug all the time, but I
          still kept him.

     Eddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in
     his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the
     match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The
     homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look.
          

     INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Eddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the
     door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials.

                    EDDIE
          It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did
          they check the hospitals?  Airports? 
          Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We
          should be all over everywhere - with
          dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys
          are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia...

     He looks at the flowers.  Decides to put the case behind him
     for a moment.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          I'll call you later.

     He HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look
     perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card,
     writes, "Nicky, I love you. 
     Will you marry me?"  He sticks the card in the flowers -
     turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on
     the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a
     drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the
     flowers.  There's a knock at the door.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Coming!

     Eddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is
     empty.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Nicky!?!?

     No answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in
     his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn't notice the
     shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. 
     Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone.

                    EDDIE (CONT'D)
          Nicky?!

     He walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the
     door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the
     head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD!

     A BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE

     as it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped
     to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting
     in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the
     flowers in a vase.  They've ransacked the place.  Emil has
     Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.  He's smoking
     one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond
     engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is
     positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the
     corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate
     Eddie's face.

                    EMIL
          So...who's Nicky?

                    EDDIE
          What do you want?

                    EMIL
          Your opinion.
               (leaning forward)
          You see, they going to make a movie
          about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.

                    EDDIE
               (sarcastic)
          What's your accomplishment.

                    EMIL
          I kill someone famous.

                    EDDIE
          Then do it, asshole.

                    EMIL
          Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who
          plays you will want to die like hero.

     Eddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie's look.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          So tabloids don't have to do re
          enactments.  They going to have real
          movie this time.

                    EDDIE
          If you kill me and film it you're
          putting a noose around your neck.

     Emil turns to Oleg.

                    EMIL
          Turn it off.

     Oleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy
          men would film their murders?
               (gestures to Eddie)
          So we kill someone famous and if we are
          caught, we are sent to mental hospital. 
          But what good is money there?  Because
          once in hospital I say I not crazy. 
          Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see
          psychiatrists.  They must certify we are
          sane and because of your - what is law
          called?
               (Eddie says nothing)
          Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double
          Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same
          crime twice.  We come out free, rich and
          famous!

                    OLEG
          Good idea!

                    EDDIE
          You really think you'll be able to fool
          a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin'
          stupid are you?

                    EMIL
          Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry
          baby talk shows all day long.  Not only
          will Americans believe me, they'll cry
          for me.
               (laughs)
          So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you
          like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? 
          Maybe you can propose to her now?

     Eddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on
     Eddie's cigar.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Okay.  He has nothing to say.
               (signaling Oleg)
          Start the camera!

                    OLEG
          Cut!

     Emil looks at Oleg.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
          am the director!  You are the talent. 
          You wait for me to say 'action!'

     Emil looks at Eddie as if to say, "See what I have to put up
     with."  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          And...action!

     Oleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie
     suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away,
     backing out of Eddie's reach.

                    EMIL
          Bad last moment - I cut that out.

     Emil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's
     left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the
     gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing
     and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over
     into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and
     Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor.

     Oleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around
     with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning
     him to the wall.

     Eddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as
     Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way
     with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair
     repeatedly.

     Eddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him
     from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and
     onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
     leaving Oleg on the sofa.

     Eddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair
     in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
     gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is
     not clear in the darkness who has the gun.

     Oleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the
     videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up
     as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting
     toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the
     window and one of the lampshades off the lamp.

     Oleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn
     toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in
     the stomach.

     Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
     STOMACH.

     Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
     the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got
     stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be
     dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain
     is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a
     close up.

     Emil looks at Eddie.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Die.  Die.

     Emil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie
     off, suffocating him.
          

     BLACKNESS

     We are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you
     feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally,
     in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. 
     We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a
     tiny pixel on a TV screen.

     WIDENING

     further out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's
     an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and
     dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed
     over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in
     his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with
     the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio
     from Eddie's funeral.

                    NEWSCASTER (ON T.V.)
          ..Detective Flemming was one of the most
          decorated NYPD detectives in the history
          of New York.  He made several thousand
          arrests during his career, including the
          famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by
          the community in which he served.  His
          partner eulogized him...

     Leon is at the mic. 

                    LEON (ON T.V.)
          ...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend
          and my partner...he taught me the
          meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man
          in every sense of the word.  I'll miss
          him...
               (choking on tears)
          Sleep well, brother.

     Leon begins to sing "Amazing Grace."  Oleg PANS from the TV
     and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame -
     carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long
     hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is
     pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. 
     Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again,
     the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a
     table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT
     revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this.

     INT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

     It's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many
     who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black
     ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake -
     boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet
     has been laid out.

     Hawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He
     greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon.

                    HAWKINS
          Awful...what an awful day.  He was New
          York City.

     Hawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's
     Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him.

                    TOMMY
          I never got to tell him how much I
          admired him.

                    HAWKINS
          I know, son, I know.  We all loved him.

     Hawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of
     the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves
     to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at
     him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. 
     Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins.

                    NICOLETTE
          You know...you know he was gonna propose
          to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd
          written out to me.  And a ring
          box...these fuckers that killed him -
          have my ring.  They have my diamond
          engagement ring...

     Hawkins touches her shoulder with compassion.

                    HAWKINS
          I know.

                    NICOLETTE
          What do you mean you know?  He told you
          he was gonna propose to me?

                    HAWKINS
          Well, he...

                    NICOLETTE
               (overriding)
          I want to hear everything he said.

                    HAWKINS
          I'm trying to tell you.

                    NICOLETTE
          Alright.  Go ahead.

                    HAWKINS
          That morning.  He was talking to me and
          Leon about marriage.

                    NICOLETTE
          Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. 
          He started making overtures - talking
          about little shoes next to his in his
          closet but I got a call to anchor - and
          I walked out on him.  I walked out on
          him when he was trying to ask me to
          marry him!!

     Nicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          I'd never had a great relationship
          before.  I'd never made great choices
          with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to
          know.  He was older, my parents told me
          I was nuts to get involved with him. 
          But he was so great to me.  Always
          encouraging, telling me I could do
          anything...
               (beat)
          He was the one.  You know, I'd give up
          everything - everything - for just a
          little more time.  I would've spent
          fifteen minutes with him if that's all I
          knew I had.

     She's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him
     off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A
     woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow.

                    MAGGIE
          Robert...?

                    HAWKINS
          What are you doing here?

                    MAGGIE
               (holding a cellular)
          You've got a call.

                    HAWKINS
          I can't talk to anybody right now, can't
          you see I'm busy!  I can't talk
          business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.
               (to Paulie)
          Get her a whiskey.

                    MAGGIE
          Trust me, you'll want to take this call.

     Robert steps off the stool.  Takes the phone.

                    HAWKINS
          Hello?  Who is this?
               (listens)
          How do I know this is you?

     Hawkins gives Nicolette a comforting squeeze on her shoulder. 
     Backs away from the bar.  Now out of hearing distance, he
     looks back at Nicolette and lowers his voice.

                    HAWKINS (CONT'D)
          Where?

     We INTERCUT Emil on a public phone in the lobby of a movie
     theater.  Oleg videotapes Emil on the phone, as he throws
     glances into the theater.

                    EMIL
          Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the
          Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my
          next film.

                    HAWKINS
               (low)
          Look asshole.  I've been threatened by
          better than you.

                    EMIL
          No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened
          you.

                    HAWKINS
          I'll meet you on one condition - I get
          exclusivity and you surrender to me.

                    EMIL
          We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock
          gives you time to go to bank.  Three
          hundred thousand dollars.

                    HAWKINS
          What?  It doesn't work that way.

                    EMIL
               (incensed)
          If you don't want my film - I'll call
          another show.  And they will show it.

                    HAWKINS
          Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

                    EMIL
          Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk
          about surrendering.

     CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Hawkins disconnects.  Hands the
     phone back to Maggie.  She's looking at him.  Excited. 
     Hawkins looks at Nicolette.  His mind whirls.

     INT. FIRE STATION 91 - KITCHEN - DAY

     Daphne and Korfin are sitting at a table.  Korfin's arm is in
     a sling, his side bandaged.  Duffy and Jordy enter in their
     dress uniforms.  Korfin walks over to them.

                    KORFIN
          How was it?

                    JORDY
               (numb)
          Not good.

     Jordy's quiet.  Dazed.  Nobody can believe Eddie's gone.

                    DUFFY
               (nods to Daphne)
          Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?

                    KORFIN
          Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.

                    DUFFY
               (to Korfin)
          Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let
          her pick up her clothes and take her
          straight to Hoover Street.  You got
          that?

                    KORFIN
          Yeah.

     Jordy looks at her.  Duffy sees them hold each other's look.

                    JORDY
          Chief - mind if I take her?

                    DUFFY
          Okay.  But not water sports.

     Duffy walks out.  Jordy leads Daphne out of the station. 
     Korfin follows.  A MAN IN A CHEAP SUIT is talking to Camello
     who points as Jordy walks by.  The man chases after Jordy.

                    MAN
          Excuse me - Jordan Warsaw?

                    JORDY
          Yeah.

                    MAN
               (shoving papers in Jordy's
                hand)
          Consider yourself served.

     Jordy opens the papers.  Korfin puts Daphne in the car. 
     Walks back over to Jordy and reads over his shoulder.

                    KORFIN
          Zwangendaba??? Is suing you, the
          department and the city of New York for
          10 million?  Who is Zwangendaba?

     Jordy remembers...and gets more depressed.

                    JORDY
          The mugger.
                              
          EXT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

     It's an old brownstone - in poor condition.  Jordy pulls up. 
     Opens the door for Daphne - takes her by the elbow - steering
     her to the door.  He is edgy.  Jumpy.  Looking around.

                    DAPHNE
          Are you alright?

                    JORDY
          I still can't believe Eddie's gone.

                    DAPHNE
          I'm sorry.

     He looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the
     front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls
     Daphne out of the way.

                    DAPHNE (CONT'D)
               (in Czech to the man)
          Hello.  How are you?

     INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

     Jordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of
     flowers are outside Daphne's apartment.

                    JORDY
          What's this?

     She takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne
     reads: "Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you
     need me...Ludwig."

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Is he your boyfriend?

                    DAPHNE
          Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?

                    JORDY
          If I was your boyfriend, I might be.

                    DAPHNE
          If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest
          you find another girlfriend that isn't
          going to jail ten-thousand miles away.

     They're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension
     strong.

                    JORDY
          A good Immigration lawyer could stall
          the process.  Eddie recommended one.

                    DAPHNE
          No matter what happens...I'm glad I met
          you.

                    JORDY
          I'm glad I met you.

     They hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. 
     Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. 
     They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the
     hall.  Jordy clears his throat.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Let's get your stuff.

     He opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to
     her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter.

     INT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     It's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. 
     The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking
     the same thought.  Another kiss. 

                    JORDY
          You better get packed.

                    DAPHNE
          Right.

     She holds his look.

                    JORDY
          Do you have coffee?

                    DAPHNE
          In the kitchen.

                    JORDY
          I'll make some for us.

                    DAPHNE
          I'll get my clothes.

     She heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He
     flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES -
     SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO
     THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK.

                    DAPHNE (CONT'D)
          Jordy!!!

                    JORDY
          No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!!

     Jordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows
     the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices
     a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it
     at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne
     SCREAMS!

                    DAPHNE
          That's not mine!

     WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames
     leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher
     because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy
     CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and
     JORDY'S HAND.

     He flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. 
     Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it
     under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He
     hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before
     the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. 
     Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a
     chair through the window.

                    JORDY
          Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us!

     Too late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in
     the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along
     the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone:

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075,
          make it quick, we're trapped!  8th
          Avenue and 44th Street.

     He pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy
     kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that
     under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. 
     Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold
     water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. 
     She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top
     of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield.

                    DAPHNE
          Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d!

     Jordy turns - sees Eddie's shield.

                    DAPHNE (CONT'D)
          They were here!

     This freaks her out.  They were in her home.  She starts to
     panic.

                    JORDY
          Calm down.  Get a hold of yourself!  Get
          down!

     He pulls aside the curtain to the bathtub.  In it is a CAN OF
     GASOLINE.  A virtual bomb.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Oh Jesus!

     Daphne reaches for the can of gasoline.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                    DAPHNE
          Pouring it out!

     She grabs the can of gasoline - pours it down the drain.  The
     FIRE is raging outside the bathroom.  The bathroom door is
     beginning to smoke and burn.  They are trapped.

     Jordy turns - grabs an exposed water pipe that runs up the
     wall to the ceiling.  He throws his feet against the wall for
     leverage.  Pulls with all his might to break it loose.  It's
     creaking - but he's having a hard time with it.

                    DAPHNE (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!

     Jordy looks over.  The gasoline she's pouring out - is not
     going down the drain.  It's stopped up.  As soon as the fire
     gets in the bathroom, everything will explode!

     Jordy begins pulling at the rusty pipe with all his might. 
     Daphne comes over - helps him.  Both of them trying to break
     it off.  Suddenly it snaps and water POURS into the room. 
     SOAKING THE WALLS.  They point the pipe toward the door,
     soaking some of the flames which are consuming the door. 
     Trying to stop the fire from coming in.  He and Daphne are
     drenched.  And trapped.

     Jordy grabs a broken piece of pipe.  Starts SMASHING the wall
     behind them.  The wall to the adjacent apartment.

     VIDEO POV

     Jordy and Daphne in the bathroom - surrounded by fire. 
     CAMERA WHIP PANS down the street as FIRE ENGINES arrive.

     OLEG

     is VIDEOTAPING them from the opposite rooftop.  Tenants from
     Daphne's building are fleeing down the fire escape.  Emil
     stands in back of Oleg - who is very excited.  He turns the
     camera on himself.

                    OLEG
          This is great film!  You can see fire
          right now - Daphne is in fire - Fire
          Marshal is here.  Everything is so
          messy.  Everything is so crazy right
          here!  Look at this fire!  We made it! 
          90% of people who die in fire die from
          eating smoke.  So most likely they all
          die from eating smoke.

     The CAMERA PANS to Emil.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          And this is the man who started the
          fire.  Say something to your fans, Emil!

     Emil waits a beat and then blows a kiss to the lens.

     DAPHNE'S BATHROOM

     Filled with smoke.  You can barely see Jordy or Daphne. 
     Jordy SMASHES a hole in the wall - which reveals the bathroom
     in the apartment next door.  The smoke has a place to escape. 
     There's a 7-year old KID in there.  Standing in the bathroom. 
     Terrified.

                    JORDY
          Get back!  Get out of the bathroom! 
          Run!

                    7-YEAR OLD KID
          The hallway is on fire!

                    JORDY
          It's okay.  I'm a fireman.  I'm going to
          help you.  Get back!  Now!

     Jordy pushes Daphne through the wall - turns as the bathroom
     door catches fire.  It's seconds before the whole room will
     blow up.

     OLEG

     Across the roof is videotaping the bathroom as it EXPLODES!

     EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Fire engines have arrived.  The street is filled with
     gawkers.  Garcia and Korfin pull up just as Jordy runs from
     the building - holding the kid in one arm and pulling Daphne
     with the other.  Carefully guarding his bandaged hand.  A
     fireman grabs the kid.  Another grabs Daphne.  Garcia and
     Korfin run to Jordy.

                    GARCIA
          Jordy!  What the hell happened?!

                    KORFIN
          Are you alright, man?  Lemme see the
          hand!

                    JORDY
          Where's Daphne?  Daphne?

     He spots Daphne on the corner as a familiar voice pushes
     through the crowd.

                    VOICE
          Isn't she a beauty?  She's my fire, look
          at that loom-up on her!

     Jordy turns - it's Max.  The attention pyromaniac who Jordy
     threw out of his office.  As a news crew arrives, Max turns
     to the cameras.

                    MAX
          I did this!  I did this!  Take my
          picture!  I'm Max!  Max Gornick!

     Jordy grabs Max - pushes him away.

                    JORDY
          Get outta here!

                    KORFIN
          What the hell happened?

                    JORDY
          They were inside.  They booby trapped
          her apartment!

     Korfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the
     b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING.

                    DUFFY
          What the hell are you talking about??? 
          They're gonna do what?

     Jordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and
     is freaked.

     INT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT

     JORDY'S POV

     as he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still
     wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still
     in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the
     producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk.

                    TOMMY
          Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?!

                    MAGGIE
          He's not on the premises!

                    LEON
          I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it
          here this minute.

                    MAGGIE
          Any request for the video must be
          directed to "Top Story's" attorney -
          Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you
          his number.

     Leon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes
     past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward
     Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries
     to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open.

                    LEON
          Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV,
          I'll get a warrant for your arrest and
          shove it so far up your ass it'll come
          outta your mouth!

                    MAGGIE
          I want your shield number!

                    HAWKINS (O.S.)
          Viewer discretion advised!

                    MAGGIE
               (pointing at the TV)
          You want the tape?  There it is!

     Leon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set
     which is mounted in the lobby.  The "Top Story" logo flashes
     on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk.

                    HAWKINS
          What we are about to broadcast is very
          graphic footage...

     Everyone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a "Top
     Story" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins
     jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out.

     INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT

     POP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is
     popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the
     table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the
     glass - looking into the lens.

                    EMIL
          America!  Who says you can't be success
          in America?  I arrived with nothing,
          knowing nobody - now look - I am a
          success story!

     The videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks
     suspiciously.

                    OLEG
          You are success story?  I am success
          story!  Why do you say I and not we?

                    EMIL
          Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a
          hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't
          you?  I gave you half of what they gave
          me.  Look - here we are!

     Emil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in
     Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can
     watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins
     is introducing his show.

                    HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
          Good evening.  Welcome to "Top Story". 
          Tonight, I present to you material of a
          graphic and violent nature never before
          seen on television.  And I do so with a
          heavy heart.  You will be first-hand
          witness to the slaying of celebrated New
          York City Homicide Detective, Eddie
          Flemming.  It would be only normal to
          ask, why?  Why are we showing something
          so journalist, I must show it.  A
          democracy survives through the freedom
          of its media, and if we cannot see what
          is happening then we don't deserve our
          democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie
          Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I
          watched this footage and vowed to fight
          this violence with every molecule of my
          being from this day onward.  Hopefully,
          this will have a similar effect on you. 
          One final word, this material is
          absolutely not appropriate for children.

     The restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch.

                    OLEG
          In movie they make of us, who do you
          think would act me?

                    EMIL
          The one who got caught in the bathroom.
               (beat)
          George Michael.

     Emil laughs.  Oleg doesn't.

                    OLEG
          I'm serious.

                    EMIL
          Shut up.  Look!

     Emil points towards the TV.  "Top Story" is continuing.  The
     scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to
     the chair.  The light illuminating his face.

                    OLEG (O.S.)
          This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I
          am the director!  You are the talent. 
          You wait for me to say 'action.'
               (beat)
          And 'action!'

                    EMIL
          Bad last moment - I cut it out.

     Emil looks at Oleg - furious.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          I told you to cut that out before we
          handed in the tape!

                    OLEG
          Be quiet.  Watch.

     Oleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to
     Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then
     knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto
     the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives
     Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie
     and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the
     way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. 
     Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and
     he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The
     blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more
     light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down
     for a CLOSE-UP.

                    EMIL
          Die.  Die.

     EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

     Hawkins' van drives across Times Square.  Jordy's car
     following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast
     on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned.

     INT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

     The dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at
     Oleg.

                    EMIL
          Why did you leave that stuff in about
          you being the director?

                    OLEG
          Because I am the director.  Don't you
          realize, if it wasn't for my film, for
          my talent, my idea to do this - no way
          would we be sitting here right now.

                    EMIL
          Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.

     Oleg tenses.  Emil laughs.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Aren't you just the cameraman?

     Oleg doesn't laugh.

                    OLEG
          I'm serious...this - this is a great
          American film.  Full of violence and
          sex.  And I want my credit.

                    EMIL
          Credit?

                    OLEG
          Yes.  Before we hand in the next video -
          I put titles on it and my credit is
          going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.

                    EMIL
          Yes.  But there's only one problem - you
          want credit but the problem is - I don't
          share credit.

     Oleg is pissed.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          You got that?

                    OLEG
          No, I don't get that!

                    EMIL
          You think you are a director?  You are a
          fucking little, small Russian piece of
          shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate
          you.

     Emil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil
     suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the
     trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a
     shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg
     runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It's chaos. 
     Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a
     confident, tough criminal attorney.

     Emil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin -
     pressing it to his wound.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Oh, hello.

     Cutler accesses the situation.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Are you my attorney?
               (extends his hand to Cutler)
          I'm Emil.  I'm insane.

                    CUTLER
          I'm not your lawyer until I see the
          money.

                    EMIL
          Here.  I have your money.

     Emil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler
     opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. 
     Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware
     aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside,
     freaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          Oh no!  No!  Shit!

                    CUTLER
               (follows Emil - reaching out to
                him)
          Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit
          down.  What do you need?  What are you
          looking for?

                    EMIL
          He has the camera!  He took the movie!

     Jordy comes in, gun raised.

                    JORDY
          Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands
          up!  Drop it!

     Emil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun!

                    EMIL
          I give up!

     Jordy is disappointed!  He didn't want to take Emil alive. 
     Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at
     Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head.

                    CUTLER
          This man is unarmed, officer.  He's
          surrendered.

     Jordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down.

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          What are you hitting him for?

                    JORDY
          Turn that camera off!

     Jordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy,
     appearing more hurt than he is.

                    EMIL
          No.  Keep filming...

     Jordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in
     that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up -
     dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still
     favoring his ankle.

                    CUTLER
               (to Emil)
          Don't say anything.

                    EMIL
          Where are we going?

                    CUTLER
          I'm coming with you.

                    EMIL
          Yes.  Yes, come with me!

                    CUTLER
               (to Jordy)
          I'm invoking rights - this man is
          represented by counsel.  I'm coming with
          him.

     The "Top Story" crew is all over them, filming everything. 
     Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video
     footage.

                    JORDY
          Turn that camera off!

     EXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS

     As Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. 
     Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door
     to his car.  Leon grabs Emil.

                    LEON
          I'll take him.

                    JORDY
          No way!  He's mine!

                    LEON
               (holding on to Emil, squeezing
                his arm hard)
          We're takin' him.  Don't argue!

                    JORDY
          He's my collar!

                    LEON
          Well, he killed my partner!

                    JORDY
          He's yours but I take him in!  I'll
          drive him to the precinct, you can have
          him but I'm walkin' him in.

     Leon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into
     custody.

                    LEON
          Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll
          follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him!

     Leon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are
          goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile
          when they put you down!

     Cutler hurries to Emil's side.

                    CUTLER
          Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his
          taunting!
               (to Leon)
          He's represented by counsel.  You want
          to speak to someone - you speak to me!

                    TOMMY
          Out of the way, counselor.

     Tommy shoves Cutler aside.

                    CUTLER
          Don't you put your hands on me,
          Detective.

     Jordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon
     turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything.

                    LEON
          And you, you'll pay for what you did!

                    HAWKINS
               (low)
          This footage will work in your favor. 
          When the jury sees this - no matter what
          Cutler tries, they'll convict him.

     Leon looks at him. This man used to be his friend.

                    LEON
          You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of
          yourself.

                    HAWKINS
          If I didn't put it on somebody else
          would!  I was his friend!

                    LEON
          Don't give me that fucking shit.

     The cameras are rolling.

                    MURPHY
          Don't get into it on TV.

                    LEON
               (yells to other cop cars)
          Alright, let's get going!

     Leon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already
     behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger
     seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away.
          
     INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT

     Jordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the
     lights.

                    TOMMY
          What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose
          everybody!

     Jordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side
     Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left
     lane - having lost the police.

                    TOMMY (CONT'D)
          Where are you goin'??  This ain't the
          way to the station!

     Jordy looks up at Emil in the rear view mirror.

     EXT. WEST SIDE HIGHWAY EXIT - CONTINUOUS

     Jordy pulls off on 130th Street.  They are way uptown in the
     middle of nowhere.  The car drives down a dark street.  
     Crumbled, vacant buildings dominate the streets and there are
     no people around.

     EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

     The car slows down.  Tommy watches Jordy, realizes what's
     going on.  Jordy stops at a dead end.  Pulls open the back
     door, yanks Emil out and starts to drag him up into the
     deserted tunnel.

                    TOMMY
          Jordy...??? Listen to me.  You can't do
          this.  This isn't the way to do things.

     Jordy ignores Tommy, slamming him up against the tunnel wall.

                    JORDY
          Were you a fireman?  That how you knew
          how to rig the apartment?

                    EMIL
          My father was.  He gave me many lessons
          about fire.  Now it's my friend.

                    JORDY
          Tommy, take a walk.

                    TOMMY
          What are you gonna do?

                    JORDY
          Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna
          get caught!  That's why he videotaped
          Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna
          get off.

                    TOMMY
          Don't stoop to his level!

     Jordy tosses the car keys to Tommy.

                    JORDY
          Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.

                    TOMMY
          Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.

                    JORDY
               (erupting)
          GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR
          AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL
          KILL YOU, TOO!!!

     Tommy nervously backs up toward Jordy's car.  Climbs behind
     the wheel and drives away, leaving Jordy and Emil alone in
     the darkness.  Jordy takes out Eddie's pistol.  The one Emil
     took from Eddie.  Jordy opens the cylinder - two bullets
     left.  Jordy snaps the cylinder shut, tucks Eddie's gun in
     Emil's belt.  He drags Emil away from the wall, into the
     center of the empty space - unlocks Emil's handcuffs and
     throws them aside.  Still holding the gun on Emil, he circles
     around to face him.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Get your hands up!  Get your hands up!

     Now facing Emil, he sticks his gun in his waistband - the
     same place he put Emil's.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          You wanna be a real American?  Go for
          your gun.

     Emil holds his arms out - making it clear he's not going for
     the gun.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Pull the gun!  You want to be famous? 
          Shoot me, you'll get more headlines and
          make more money.

     Emil watches Jordy...a slow grin spreads across his face.

                    EMIL
          You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. 
          Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you
          never shot anybody in your life.

                    JORDY
          You'll be my first.

     Jordy pulls out his 9mm and pushes the barrel right between
     Emil's eyes.

                    EMIL
          C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh,
          look, you're sweating.  You don't have
          the balls.

                    JORDY
          Get down on your knees.

     Emil gets on his knees and starts to sing in Czech.  SIRENS
     fill the air.  Police cars come flying down the street.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Where's your partner?

                    EMIL
          The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. 
          Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.

     Leon runs up.  Tommy's relieved to see Jordy didn't kill
     Emil.

                    LEON
          Gimme your gun, Jordy.  We all want him
          dead but you can't do it this way.

     Emil is still smiling.  Jordy suddenly slams Emil in the
     face.  Knocking him to the floor.  He jumps in his car and
     speeds away.
          
          INT. BROADWAY SHERATON - 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     A room service WAITER wheels a tray with a magnum bottle of
     Crystal, with three glasses, toward Oleg's room.  Jordy
     follows behind him - gun aimed at his back.

                    WAITER
          Do you really need me?

                    JORDY
          Keep your mouth shut.  Don't mess this
          up.

     They reach the room.  Jordy flattens himself against the
     wall.  The waiter KNOCKS.

                    HOOKER'S VOICE
          Who's there?

                    WAITER
               (nervous)
          R-room service.

     A HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking
     out at the waiter.

                    HOOKER
          Come in.

     Jordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing
     the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom
     door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the
     bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked
     up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his
     footage of the fire.

                    OLEG
          Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. 
          No cuts.
               (excited)
          And look.  Look at that transition. 
          That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?!

     Jordy KICKS in the door - gun raised.

                    JORDY
          Don't move!

     Oleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and
     picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of
     the hookers for protection.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Drop the girl!  Drop her!!

     Oleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into
     the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes
     out into the

     HOTEL HALLWAY

     Oleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down
     the stairwell.

     EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

     Oleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs
     through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases
     him, gun in hand!

     Oleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic,
     cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. 
     Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. 
     Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his
     underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding
     the camera in his hand.  It's on.

                    JORDY
          STOP!  STOP THAT MAN!

     A UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking
     him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into:

     INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     Oleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door.

                    TICKET TAKER
          Hey, come back here!

     The ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy
     counter.  Jordy rushes in the door.

                    JORDY
          Where is he?  Where'd he go?

                    TICKET TAKER
          Middle door.

     Jordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle
     door - and enters the theater through the far door.

     INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

     Jordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a
     night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. 
     He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle.

                    DRUNK'S VOICE
          Kill him!  Kill the bastard!

     Jordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start
     YELLING for blood!

                    AUDIENCE
          Shoot him!  SHOOT!

     A GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes
     the shots are coming from the screen.

                    OLEG
          Look!  Over here!

     Jordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to
     film Jordy's death with a videocamera. 
     Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over
     the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders
     and heads, bounding for the screen.

                    JORDY
          Everybody down!  Stay DOWN!

     Jordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the
     audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg
     leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. 
     Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES
     back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a
     clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy
     raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! 
     Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has
     disappeared.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Shit!

     SIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as
     they enter.

     CLOSE ON TV

     A REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie
     theater.

                    REPORTER (ON T.V.)
          ...and the wild chase through Times
          Square ended with the suspect, Oleg
          Razgul, escaping.  The fire department
          has identified the fire marshal involved
          in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw.

     The channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same
     story.

                    PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
          In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's
          attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for
          handling sensational cases - claims his
          client is unfit to stand trial.

     INT. JAIL CELL - WIDER - DAY

     Daphne sitting on a bench in a jail cell.  Watching TV
     through the bars.  She is in the fire department's holding
     cell in Brooklyn.

                    PETER ARNETT (ON T.V.)
          In fact, Cutler claimed Mr. Slovak was
          not the alleged mastermind behind the
          murders. 
          According to Cutler, Mr. Slovak was
          being directed by his partner, who
          threatened to kill him if he didn't
          follow Mr. Razgul's orders.  Cutler told
          reporters today that Mr. Razgul did in
          fact stab his client.

     The scene CUTS TO Cutler's press conference.

                    CUTLER
          My client, Mr. Slovak, is a victim. 
          What's happened is not his fault.  Emil
          was under the influence of his partner. 
          At the trial, you'll see that my client
          will be vindicated...

     INT. BELLEVUE - MENTAL OBSERVATION UNIT - DAY

     The CAMERA WIDENS from the TV set.  We are now in an
     interview room, a guard is posted outside the room.  Emil
     sits at a small table - with Cutler.  Emil is dressed in
     Bellevue clothes.  He's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. 
     Emil gives a complimentary nod toward Cutler.

                    CUTLER
          I brought you some letters.  It's really
          fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to
          buy you clothes, another sent a check. 
          Another wants a check.

                    EMIL
          You bring the cigarettes?

                    CUTLER
          Oh, sure.

     Cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in
     Emil's mouth and lights it for him.  Emil has never smoked
     before.

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          How're they treating you, alright
               (Emil is nonresponsive)
          I want to get the cuffs off... but
          there's a little bit of a problem. 
          Things out there are very negative right
          now for us.  We gotta change that
          around.  Perception is very, very
          important.  Perception is reality.  I
          know you're not fuckin' crazy.  But it's
          important that I get that message out. 
          Cause that's our only defense in this
          case.

     Emil leans forward.  Cutler retrieves the cigarette from
     between his lips.

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          I want you to focus on three things:
          fear...

     He puts the cigarette back in Emil's mouth.

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          ...delusions and paranoia.

                    EMIL
          I was all of these.

                    CUTLER
          Well, you didn't appreciate the severity
          of it until recently.  No question about
          that.

                    EMIL
          What about Oleg?

                    CUTLER
          Disappeared.  They're looking
          everywhere.  Maybe he went back to
          Czechoslovakia.

                    EMIL
          No, he is here.  Shit...

                    CUTLER
          Don't worry about him.  Think about
          yourself.

                    EMIL
          What about my movie rights?  Book
          rights?

                    CUTLER
          Look, I haven't really focused on that
          kind of thing.

                    EMIL
          What's your cut?  How much?

                    CUTLER
          I would say...half.  Half is fair.

                    EMIL
               (laughs)
          No.  No way.

                    CUTLER
          But it's...

                    EMIL
          Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call
          another lawyer.  This is the biggest
          case of your life.  Don't try to
          negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or
          no.

                    CUTLER
          This is not about money, Emil.  I need
          your trust in me.

                    EMIL
          What else do you need?

                    CUTLER
          I need to know about your background.  I
          need to know about your upbringing.  Why
          you're here.

                    EMIL
               (indicating cigarette)
          Give me another one, please.

     Cutler stuffs another cigarette in Emil's mouth.  Lights it.

                    CUTLER
          Tell me about yourself.  What you did as
          a young boy... what your parents were
          like.

                    EMIL
          My father always degraded me.  Killed my
          self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.

                    CUTLER
          Your mother was blind?

                    EMIL
          Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. 
          She went to fucking black market doctor
          to induce me.

                    CUTLER
          Back in the Czech Republic?

                    EMIL
          Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad
          drugs which made her go blind.  And my
          father blamed me for her blindness...

                    CUTLER
          Your father blamed you for your mother's
          blindness?

                    EMIL
          Yeah, he hated me from day when I was
          born.  Put it out.  Can you put the
          cigarette out?

     Cutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes
     it.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          That's what he did to me.  He put
          cigarettes out on me.

                    CUTLER
          Your father put cigarettes out on you?

                    EMIL
          Out on my back when I was a small boy.

                    CUTLER
          Can I see your back?

     Emil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS
     ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM
     CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified.

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          Oh, Jesus.

                    EMIL
          I'm abused.  Don't you think?

                    CUTLER
          I don't think it's abuse, I think it's
          torture.

     INT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY

     Inside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy
     stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can
     see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a
     subpoena in his hand.

                    DUFFY
          The public doesn't have any idea what we
          do and now you're going to define our
          image!  This is going to be our Rodney
          King!

                    JORDY
          What was I supposed to do?  The guy
          tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop
          back - I just forgot.

                    DUFFY
          Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a
          tree?!

                    JORDY
          Chief - I know I screwed up - but this
          guy was no innocent civilian.

                    DUFFY
          Well this is gonna end your career and
          probably mine.

                    JORDY
          End my career?

                    DUFFY
          How are you going to fight this?  Maybe
          if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd
          been on the front page, as a hero, this
          thing would be easier to fight.  You'd
          have the good to weight against the bad! 
          It's unfortunate that I have to make
          decisions based upon your press coverage
          but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme
          your shield.

                    JORDY
          But Chief?  Over this??

                    DUFFY
          There's nothing to talk about.  Get a
          good lawyer.  You're suspended until
          your trial.

     Jordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops
     his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun
     - looks at it.

                    DUFFY (CONT'D)
               (pats Jordy's shoulder)
          I know you got backup at home.  Drop it
          off.

     Jordy sighs and exits.

     INT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY

     Jordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In
     another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT
     U.S. ATTORNEYS.

                    STERN
               (to Jordy)
          Look, what don't you understand?  We've
          got a good relationship with the Czech's
          and the State Department doesn't want to
          cause an incident.

                    JORDY
          But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness!

                    STERN
          They've got her testimony on videotape. 
          And even if they do take her to court
          immediately after she'll be extradited. 
          The Czechs want her back.  She shot a
          cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil
          Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech
          Republic?  How would you feel if the
          Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?!

     Stern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers
     his voice.

                    STERN (CONT'D)
          And just between us...I was married to a
          redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are
          like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from
          both.

     Jordy gives him a look.

                    STERN (CONT'D)
          You want to see her - go ahead.

     Jordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The
     assistant U.S. Attorneys leave.

                    JORDY
          We're gonna fight the extradition.

     Daphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers.

                    DAPHNE
          Forget about me.  You have enough
          problems of your own.

                    JORDY
          ...Do you really want me to forget about
          you?

                    DAPHNE
          I don't want to drag you down with me.

                    JORDY
          Daphne, I...

     Daphne touches her finger to his lips.

                    DAPHNE
          Shhhh.

     She leans in and kisses him.  Then looks into his eyes,
     trying to find a smile.

     EXT. FEDERAL COURT HOUSE STEPS - DAY

     It's weeks later.  Nicolette is looking worn, tired,
     frazzled.  She's trying to go through her stand up.  But
     she's unraveling.  Not recovered from the loss of Eddie.

                    NICOLETTE 
          ...and today with his partner who he
          blamed for the crimes still at large,
          Emil Slovak will appear in court.  His
          lawyer will argue that he is mentally 
          unfit to stand trial.  Eyewitness News
          has also learned that later this month,
          Jordy Warsaw will himself be appearing
          in court.  He will be arraigned on
          charges of violating the civil rights
          of...Zwangen...Zwagen...

                    MIKE
          Zwangendaba.

                    NICOLETTE
          Goddamn assholes everywhere. 
          Zwangenbobby..Zwangendaba.  I got it. 
          I'll do it.  Shit.  Let's start again. 
          5-4-3-2-1...

     She starts over.

     INT. JORDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Jordy's on the couch.  A drink in his hand, watching TV with
     his dog, ZACK.  Jordy's eyes are glazed.  He's drunk, his
     eyes are as bloodshot as Eddie's were...without his job or
     Daphne. 
     His mind miles away - the dog and drink are his only comfort. 
     As Nicolette reports (she got the name right), her anger
     seeps through her broadcast.

                    NICOLETTE (ON T.V.)
          Mr. Zwangendaba claims to be a direct
          descendent of the African King from whom
          he takes his name...

     Jordy's face is flashed on screen.  The phone RINGS.  Jordy
     picks up.

                    JORDY
          Hello?
               (listens)
          No comment.

     He hangs up.  The phone RINGS AGAIN.

                    JORDY (CONT'D)
          Hello?
               (listens)
          No!

     Jordy hangs up.  Changes the channel.  He stops as Robert
     Hawkins' face fills the screen.  He is standing across from
     someone - in a park - interviewing him.

                    HAWKINS (ON T.V.)
          He robbed you?

     The ANGLE CUTS to Zwangendaba, the mugger, now dressed in a
     suit and tie.  Clean shaven and with a fresh haircut.  He
     stands in the same spot where Jordy handcuffed him to the
     tree.  He's appearing on "Top Story".

                    ZWANGENDABA (ON T.V.)
          That's right, I encountered him right
          here.  I was just askin' for change an'
          he whips out his big gun an' pushes me
          up against that tree, whereupon he takes
          my money and handcuffs me to it, leavin'
          me there all exposed...

     The phone RINGS again.  Jordy suddenly pulls the phone off
     the table and throws it through the window:

     BACK TO TV

     as the channel is changed.  A REPORTER is on TV.  Behind him
     is a picture of Emil.  Emil is smiling, in a shirt and tie. 
     The reporter stands in front of the jail.

                    REPORTER
          ...and WBAI has learned that Mr. Slovak
          won't have to worry about how he is
          going to pay for his defense.  He has
          received movie offers and been in
          conversations with numerous publishers
          concerning the rights to his life story.

     REVERSE ANGLE

     Oleg is at a bar watching TV.  Poisoned with envy.


     INT. JORDY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

     Jordy stands in front of the mirror over the dresser.  We see
     the TV overturned in the b.g.  His back up gun is on it.  He
     stares at it.  Dark thoughts dancing in his head.

     EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

     Jordy sits in a taxi, wearing sunglasses.  Looking inside the
     park where a POLICE BARRICADE surrounds a POLICE TUGBOAT. 
     Cutler and Emil are arriving - Emil is being transferred to
     Rykers Island.  Jordy pulls his .38 out of his ankle holster
     and sticks it in his pocket.

     CLOSE ON METER

     to $42.00.  The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror.

                    TAXI DRIVER
          I can't believe this guy got off. 
          Unbelievable.

     Jordy takes out money.  All he's got is fifty bucks and he
     crams it into the slot.

                    JORDY
          Whatever's leftover, keep.

     Jordy exits the cab.  The anger rising inside his body is
     coming to a boiling point.  He walks into the park.  Leon is
     sitting on a bench.  Just sitting there.  Also filled with
     rage and frustration.  Jordy meets his eyes.  Leon gets up
     and walks away.  Disgusted by it all.  Jordy's right hand
     grips the gun inside his pocket as he walks on.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT

     Many policemen are trying to control a swarm of reporters. 
     All are waiting for Emil.  WE SEE:

     HAWKINS

     and his camera crew, and, not far from him - frustrated and
     frazzled, waits Nicolette.  Still grieving her loss, she
     looks over at Hawkins and his crew.  She shoots him a
     disgusted look - Hawkins shrugs it off.  He checks his watch -
     anxious - looks at his cameraman.

                    HAWKINS
          He said he'd be here.  Pick him up as he
          comes through the crowd.  Do you hear
          me?  For Chrissakes don't miss this.

     THE POLICE VAN PULLS UP

     Cutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from
     the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his
     car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the
     POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at
     Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with:

                    CUTLER
          ...my client was suffering from a major
          illness of schizophrenic nature wherein
          during times of intense stress, as a
          result of paranoid and psychotic
          delusions - there was impairment of his
          ability to appreciate wrongfullness...
          This is a victory for the mentally ill!

     Jordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on
     Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max,
     the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? 
     Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam
     in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other
     cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their
     place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler
     continues:

                    CUTLER (CONT'D)
          ...before Emil boards the police boat
          and heads for Rykers Island where he
          will be checked into the psyche ward, I
          want to say one last word to you all...
          As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg
          Razgul into committing these murders,
          yet Oleg is still out in the street, a
          free man, filming gruesome murders... My
          client and I hope he is brought to
          justice in the near future.

     They are through the monuments, approaching the steps when
     Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch
     obsessively.

                    HAWKINS
          Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?!

     Jordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. 
     Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts.

                    JORDY
          You think this is funny??  What the hell
          are you laughing at?

     Emil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the
     jacket.

                    CUTLER
               (to a nearby escort)
          Officer, keep this man back, he's
          assaulted my client on previous
          occasions.

     A PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil.

                    JORDY
          This is it?  This bastard kills the best
          cop this city ever had and we do
          nothing?

                    CUTLER
          You may not like it marshal, but that's
          the law.

                    JORDY
          And what about the other victims??  What
          about their families?  He'll end up in
          some country club nuthouse while his
          lawyer sells his rights to the movies
          and we just stand here and do nothing? 
          We let this scumbag walk?

     Jordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. 
     Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly.

                    EMIL
          Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm
          insane.

     Jordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the
     cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to:

     A VIDEO POV

     as it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame
     tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who
     he's been waiting for.  His face lights up.

                    HAWKINS
          I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where
          is it?  Where is the tape?

     IT'S OLEG

     In disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera.

                    OLEG
          It's all in here.  All in here.

     MEANWHILE JORDY

     has been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice
     cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly:

                    HAWKINS
          Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some
          interesting evidence, something you
          should look at!

     Reporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he
     continues introducing his broadcast:

                    HAWKINS (CONT'D)
          I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL
          UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul,
          proving Emil Slovak was not insane! 
          Hard to believe...watch!

     Reporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his
     videocamera up in the air.

                    OLEG (ON VIDEO)
          He knew exactly what he was doing - all
          of this was planned!  It's all here in
          my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. 
          Look!

     Oleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts
     of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie:

                    EMIL (ON VIDEO)
          ...so we kill someone famous and if we
          are caught, we are sent to mental
          hospital...

                    CUTLER
               (points to Oleg)
          Officers, there's your killer, do your
          duty, arrest him!

     The police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of
     reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the
     press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy
     notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE
     CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which
     killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He
     yells at Oleg!

                    EMIL
          Traitor!!

                    OLEG
          No.  You are the traitor.  You are
          murderer.  I am director.  Action!

     Oleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as:

     BANG!

     Oleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings
     his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. 
     Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER
     escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He
     swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are
     screaming.  It's CHAOS.

     Emil darts forward - grabbing Nicolette who is closes to him. 
     He puts his handcuffed arms over her head - points the gun at
     her head.

                    CAPTAIN
          Drop the gun!  DON'T SHOOT!

                    EMIL
          I'll kill her!  Back off!  Everyone back
          away from me!

     We hear Jordy's voice above Emil.

                    JORDY
          Let her go.  Let her fucking go!!

     The captain is screaming at all his men.

                    CAPTAIN
          No one shoot!  Lower your weapons!  Do
          not fire!  No officer will fire his
          weapon unless I say so!
               (to Emil)
          Let the woman go!

     Cops reluctantly lower their weapons.  But Jordy is still
     aiming his gun at Emil.  He is the only one who hasn't
     lowered his gun.  The captain is yelling at him.

                    CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
          Holster your weapons!  Back away.  That
          is an order!  No officers will fire!

     Emil is screaming back at the captain as Jordy screams at
     Emil.

                    EMIL
          Tell him to put his gun down!

                    JORDY
          Let her go!  Let her go!!

                    EMIL
          If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking
          kill her.

     Jordy doesn't lower his gun.  Emil tries to back away.  The
     reporters - who have ducked and covered - are still keeping
     their lenses pointed at the scene.  This is great film! 
     Jordy follows after Emil - his gun raised.

                    JORDY
          Let her go.

                    NICOLETTE
          Shoot!  Shoot him!!

                    EMIL
          Shut up!

     Meanwhile, the captain is still yelling:

                    CAPTAIN
          No on shoot!  No one shoot!!  No officer
          will follow.  No officer will shoot!

     Nicolette is still encouraging Jordy.

                    NICOLETTE
          Shoot!  Shoot!  Shoot him!!

                    EMIL
          Shut up!

     Everyone is screaming at once.  It's mass chaos.  The captain
     is trying to keep everyone calm.  Cops following along with
     their weapons lowered.  All except Jordy - his gun still
     pointed at Emil. 
     Hawkins can't believe what footage he's getting.  He's
     pushing his cameraman to the front of the pack.  Trying to
     get the best coverage.

                    EMIL (CONT'D)
          I'll surrender!! I'll surrender if he
          lowers his gun.

     He's pointing at Jordy but he's continuing to back away
     towards the police boat.

                    NICOLETTE
          Don't.  Don't let him surrender.  Shoot
          him!

     Jordy won't take his gun off him.

                    JORDY
          Let her go.  Let her go.

     The captain is yelling at Jordy.

                    CAPTAIN
          Lower your weapon.  I told you - lower
          your weapon!

     Jordy struggles to get a clean shot at Emil.  He can't.  His
     heart pounding.  Adrenaline pumping.  He suddenly lowers his
     weapon.  Turns away.  The captain visibly relaxes.  Emil
     laughs.  Jordy suddenly turns back.  Quickly raises his
     weapon.

     JORDY SHOOTS

     Emil takes a shot in the leg.  Nicolette ducks under the
     handcuffs and scurries away.  Emil looks at Jordy - surprised
     he shot him.  Jordy FIRES AGAIN.  Emil is hit in the
     shoulder.  Jordy marches forward, EMPTYING HIS CLIP in Emil's
     chest.  Abdomen.  Head.  Gun fire echoes in the humid air as
     Emil stumbles back.  Does a funny dance and drops to the
     ground.  Dead.  The captain yells.

                    CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
          I told you not to shoot!  No officers
          should shoot.

     Jordy quietly answers:

                    JORDY
          I'm not a cop.  I'm a fire marshal.

                    HAWKINS
          He's still alive.

     Hawkins looks down at Oleg.  He is sprawled on the ground. 
     His videocamera in hand - he's still making the movie.

     OLEG'S VIDEO POV

     as it ZOOMS from the Statue of Liberty and PANS to Oleg.  He
     looks in the lens with his dying eyes, gasps:

                    OLEG
          A film...by Oleg Razgul.

     And Oleg dies but suddenly his eyes pop WIDE OPEN.  Hawkins
     jumps back, Oleg smiles, coughing in pain.

                    OLEG (CONT'D)
          How was that?

     Oleg's head rolls to one side.  Now dead.  Nicolette runs
     over to Jordy.  Composing herself.  Coming together.  Glad
     Emil is dead.  Jordy starts to walk away.

                    NICOLETTE
          Wait a minute.  Where are you going? 
          Learn from Eddie.  Talk to the court of
          public opinion.  Take the credit, you
          need it.

     She turns him around.  Straightens his tie.  Starts to push
     the hair out of his face but he stops her hand.

                    JORDY
          No thanks.

     Jordy puts something in her hand.  She looks down.  It's
     EDDIE'S BADGE.  The one Jordy took out of Daphne's bathroom. 
     She looks up at him.  Her cameraman rolling.  The lens
     pointed at Jordy.  Jordy looks at Nicolette.  Meets her eyes. 
     He doesn't want to make a statement.  He still doesn't want
     the fame.  He did learn from Eddie.  Eddie was killed because
     he was a celebrity.  Jordy wants no part of it.

                    NICOLETTE
          Cut.

     Her cameraman lowers his leans.  Jordy smiles.  She nods. 
     Jordy turns and walks away.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Get a shot of him leaving.  Then pan to
          me.

     Jordy disappears into the sea of people.  The camera PANS
     back to Nicolette.

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          Well, he wouldn't talk to us, but you
          saw it.

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK from Nicolette's face and the video is
     now on:

     THE JUMBOTRON IN TIMES SQUARE

     We PULL BACK FURTHER and FURTHER.  Nicolette finishing her
     stand up:

                    NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
          New York City has a new hero, Fire
          Marshal Jordan Warsaw.  I hope that Fire
          Marshal Warsaw's heroic actions this
          afternoon will help with his other legal
          problems.  WB11 has also learned that
          the fire Marshal has retained an
          immigration lawyer to help Daphne
          Handlova with her case.  We wish her
          well.  This is Nicolette Karas, live at
          Battery Park, WB11 New York.  Good
          night.

     THE SCREEN

                               FADES TO BLACK.
