     FADE IN ON:

     CYBERSPACE

     We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
     sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
     stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
     computer sun starts to rise.

     We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
     over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
     move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
     glorious reds and yellows.

     We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
     Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
      turn onto a street in the West 80s.

     Hold in front of a New York brownstone.

     At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the
     words:

     ADDING ART

     As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a percentage
     increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and 
     we are in real life.

     EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY

     Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
     way to Riverside Drive Park.

     We go through the brownstone window into:

     INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

     KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep.  Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
     fresh as a spring day.  Her bedroom cozy, has a queen-sized
     bed and a desk with a computer on it.  Bookshelves line every
     inch of wall space and overflow with books.  Framed on the
     children's classic.  Madeleine.

     As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
     the room.  He wears blue jeans and a workshirt.  He's carrying
     the New York Times.

                    KATHLEEN
          Good morning.

                    FRANK
               (as he reads)
          Listen to this -- the entire work force
          of the state of Virginia had to have
          solitaire removed from their computers --

     Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
     bathroom, and we stay with Frank.

                    FRANK
               (continuing)
          -- because they hadn't done any work in
          six weeks.

     Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.

                    KATHLEEN
          Aren't you late?

                    FRANK
               (continuing)
          You know what this is, you know what
          we're seeing here?  We're seeing the end
          of Western civilization as we know it.

                    KATHLEEN
          This is so sad.

     She tosses him his jacket.

                    FRANK
               (points at her computer)
          You think that machine is your friend,
          but it's not.
               (checks his watch)
          I'm late.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     As Frank walks to the apartment door.  We see a charming room
     with a couch, fireplace, books, and a dining table with a 
     typewriter with a cover on it.

                    KATHLEEN (O.C.)
          I'll see you tonight.

                    FRANK
          Sushi.

                    KATHLEEN (O.C.)
          Great.  Bye.

     Frank goes out the door.  It closes.

     Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-eye
     peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
     from sight.  She walks into:

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
     street and turns toward Broadway.

     He's gone.  Good.

     She sits down at her computer.  An expression of anticipation
     and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.

     INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

     As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
     code name: Shopgirl.  She logs on and the computer makes all
     its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
     number and connects and we hear the machine:

                    COMPUTER
          Welcome.

     And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting to
     hear:

                    COMPUTER (cont'd)
          You've got mail.

     And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:

     INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

     We see a list of letters:

     Big Cash Op: You can make $$$ in your spare time.  OIL MKT: You
     can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT: 
     Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!!  NY152 Brinkley

     Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
     all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.

     Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".

     And the letter comes up:
             To: Shopgirl
          From: NY152
             Re: Brinkley

     Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:

                    KATHLEEN
          Brinkley is my dog.  He loves the streets
          of New York as much as I do --

     And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of
     NY 152, a man named JOE FOX --

                    JOE (V.O.)
          -- although he likes to eat bits of pizza
          and bagel off the sidewalk, and I prefer
          to buy them.  Brinkley is a great catcher
          and was offered a tryout on the Mets farm
          team --
               (continued)

     INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
     is BRINKLEY.  The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
     Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
     charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
     some orange juice.  He's half-dressed.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          -- but he chose to stay with me so that
          he could spend 18 hours a day sleeping on
          a large green pillow the size of an inner
          tube.  Don't you love New York in the
          fall?  It makes me want to buy school
          supplies.  I would send you a bouquet of
          newly-sharpened pencils if I knew your
          name and address.  On the other hand,
          this not knowing has its charms.

                    VOICE
          Darling --

                    JOE
          Mmmmmhmmm --

     Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
     into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,
     which starts grinding beans.  She's carrying the morning
     papers.

                    PATRICIA
          I'm late.
               (indicating the newspaper)
          Random House fired Dick Atkins.  Good
          riddance.  Murray Chilton died.  Which
          makes one less person I'm not speaking 
          to --
               (she drains a cup of espresso
                as a second starts to come out
                of the machine)
          Vince got a great review.  He'll be
          insufferable.  Tonight,  PEN dinner --

                    JOE
          Am I going?

                    PATRICIA
          You promised.

                    JOE
          Can't I just give them money?  That's the
          cause?  Free Albanian writers?  I'm for
          that.

     Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.

                    JOE
          All right, I'll go.  You're late.

                    PATRICIA
          I know I know I know.

     She tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her.

     Hold on Joe, listening as he hears the elevator door open and
     close on the landing outside.

     IT. JOE'S DEN - DAY

     As he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs 
     on.

                    JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
          Welcome... You've got mail.

     And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I like to start my notes to you as if
          we're already in the middle of a
          conversation.  I pretend that we're 
          the oldest and dearest friends --
          as opposed to what we actually are,
          people who don't know each other's names
          and met in a Chat Room where we both
          claimed we'd never been before.

     INT. JOE'S ELEVATOR - DAY

     As Joe, dressed for work, takes the elevator down with his
     elevator man CHARLIE.  There's a certain amount of Good
     morning, etc., as the elevator goes down and the voice-over
     continues:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
          What will he say today, I wonder.  I turn
          on my computer, I wait impatiently as it
          boots up.

     EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

     As Joe comes out of his building.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
          I go on line, and my breath catches in my
          chest until I hear three little words:
          You've got mail.

     And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:

     EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., CONTINUES)
          I hear nothing, not even a sound on the
          streets of New York, just the beat of my
          own heart.  I have mail.  From you.

     EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

     As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
     and starts downtown.

     Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking into blocks behind
     her.

     As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
     West Side of Manhattan in the morning.  Mothers and fathers
     taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
     dogs being walked.  School buses picking up kids, bakery
     trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
     unopened restaurants.

     Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the 
     newsstand dealer, and picks up a New York Times.

     Metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops, nail salons,
     the pharmacy, fish store, the Cuban Chinese Restaurant,
     Zabar's.

     Joe stops at the same newsstand.  He buys all the papers --
     the Times, Wall Street Journal, Post and Daily News.

     INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

     As Kathleen picks up her coffee, walks out.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

     As Kathleen walks down Columbus, we see Joe a block behind
     her.  She stops to buy flowers and Joe passes her, crosses to
     the Ease side of Columbus Avenue.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

     A building under construction, with plywood board covering
     the front and wrapping around the corner.  Joe goes to a side
     entrance and enters.

     EXT. COLUMBUS & 73RD STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS

     As Kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in
     front of her store, a children's bookstore called "The Shop
     Around the Corner."  It is an irresistibly inviting store.
     There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large
     stuffed animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good
     Night Moon, Where the Wild Things Are.  A teddy bear in a 
     pinafore is reading The Stupids Step Out.  Waiting for
     Kathleen in front is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.

                    KATHLEEN
          Hello, Christina.  It's a beautiful day.
          Isn't it the most beautiful day?

     Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
     time.

                    CHRISTINA
          I guess.  Yeah, sure.

     Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which
     rises, making a horrible noise.  Two cabs almost collide in
     front of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts
     yelling obscenities at the other.  Kathleen unlocks the door
     to the store.

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't you love New York in the fall?

     Christina looks at her puzzled.

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

     Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read
     "OPEN" and she activates the computer system.  She looks
     around, and we see a small but charming children's bookstore,
     with wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
     some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
     of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc.  There's a 
     playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
     with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
     Witch List"  and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion, The 
     Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of Oz."
     On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

     Kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and
     suddenly stops to daydream.  A smile creeps onto her face.
     Christina looks at her.

                    CHRISTINA
          What's going on with you?

                    KATHLEEN
          Nothing.

                    CHRISTINA
          You're in love.

                    KATHLEEN
          In love?  No.  Yes.  Of course I am.
          I'm in love with Frank.  I'm practically
          living with Frank.  Do you think you
          could get our Christmas mailers out this
          week?

                    CHRISTINA
          By Monday I promise.  I have a paper due
          Friday.  Now what's going on?
               (she looks at Kathleen)
          I'm just going to stand here till you tell
          me.

     A beat.

                    KATHLEEN
          Is it infidelity if you're involved with
          someone on E-mail?

                    CHRISTINA
          Have you had sex?

                    KATHLEEN
          Of course not.  I don't even know him.

                    CHRISTINA
          I mean cybersex.

                    KATHLEEN
          No!

                    CHRISTINA
          Well, don't do it.  The minute you do,
          they lose all respect for you.

                    KATHLEEN
          It's not like that.  We just E-mail.
          It's really nothing, on top of which I'm
          definitely thinking of stopping because
          it's getting --

                    CHRISTINA
          Out of hand?

                    KATHLEEN
          Confusing.  But not really.  Because it's
          nothing.

                    CHRISTINA
          Where did you meet him?

                    KATHLEEN
          I can't even remember.
               (off Christina's look)
          The day I turned thirty I wandered into
          the Over Thirty Room for a joke, sort of
          and he was there, and we started 
          chatting.

                    CHRISTINA
          About what?

                    KATHLEEN
          Books.  Music.  How much we both love New
          York.  Harmless.  Harmless.  Meaningless.
               (starts smiling)
          Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

                    CHRISTINA
          Excuse me?

                    KATHLEEN
          Forget it.  We don't talk about anything
          personal.  We made a rule about that.
          I don't know his name, what he does or
          exactly where he lives, so it will be
          really easy to stop seeing him, because
          I'm not.

                    CHRISTINA
          God, he could be the next person to talk
          into the store.  He could be...
               (as George walks in)
          George.

     GEORGE PAPPAS, in his twenties, one of Kathleen's 
     salespeople, is a cute guy who has no idea that he's supposed
     to look in the mirror when he gets dressed.

                    GEORGE
          Morning.

                    CHRISTINA
          Are you On Line?

                    GEORGE
          As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is
          just another way to be rejected by a 
          woman.

     BIRDIE walks in.  She is in her seventies, has white hair,
     and is tiny, like a little sparrow.  She is the store's
     oldest employee, having worked there for over forty years,
     and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson.

                    KATHLEEN
          Good morning, Birdie.

                    BIRDIE
          What are you all talking about?

                    CHRISTINA
          Cybersex.

                    BIRDIE
          I tried to have cybersex once but I kept
          getting a busy signal.

                    CHRISTINA
          I know, I know.  One Saturday night I was
          really depressed about not having a date,
          so I thought, no problemo, I'll go on
          line and I won't be lonely, but I 
          couldn't get on, there were hundreds of
          thousands of people who didn't have dates
          trying to get on.
               (MORE)
          You have to wonder which is harder,
          getting a date or getting On Line when
          you don't have a date.

                    GEORGE
          Getting a date is harder.

     We hear the bell jingle as TWO WEST SIDE MOTHERS come in with 
     two KIDS IN STROLLERS.

                    KATHLEEN
               (to the kids)
          Jessica and Maia, how are you today?

     We hear the sound of the garbage truck.  Kathleen goes out
     the front door to:

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     As the commercial garbage truck pulls up and TWO GARBAGEMEN 
     start to load her trash.

                    KATHLEEN
          Hey, you forgot to pick up the garbage
          last week and I got a ticket.  And you're
          late today -- I could have gotten
          another.

                    GARBAGEMAN #1
          We were here, there was no garbage.

                    GARBAGEMAN #2
          Yeah.

                    KATHLEEN
          Of course there was --

                    GARBAGEMAN #1
          What do you think, I don't want to pick
          up garbage?  You think I go up and down
          the street picking up garbage, I'm not
          going to pick up yours?  What's the
          matter with you?

                    GARBAGEMAN #2
          Yeah.

     Kathleen is standing there, tongue-tied.
     
                    GARBAGEMAN #1
          You don't even bundle it right, you're
          supposed to bundle it and leave it near
          the curb, you leave it near the store
          and you use cheap garbage bags, they
          smear all over the place, and then I got
          to pick it up with my shovel --

     As Christina, who's helping one of the customers, looks out
     the window as the harangue continues.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

                    GARBAGEMAN #1
          And now you're busting my chops.  You're
          just another garbage pick-up to us, okay?

                    GARBAGEMAN #2
          Yeah.

     As Kathleen continues to stand there, speechless.

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

     As Kathleen comes back into the store.  Christina is ringing
     up a sale.

                    KATHLEEN
          That guy went ballistic on me.

                    CHRISTINA
          I hope you told him off.

                    KATHLEEN
          Not exactly.

     Another customer enters the store.  The bell jingles.

     EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE ON COLUMBUS - DAY

     A little truck carrying a knife sharpener, its bells ringing,
     passes the building under construction.

     INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

     WORKERS, ELECTRICIANS, MASONS, CARPENTERS, etc. in the 
     process of building what looks like a large store.  Wires
     hanging everywhere.

                    KEVIN
          The electrical contractor called.  His
          truck hit a deer last night, he won't be
          in 'til tomorrow.  The shelves are late
          because the shipment of pine had beetles.
          And there's some question about whether
          we're installing the stairs in the right
          spot --

                    JOE
          That sounds great.

                    KEVIN
          Testing one two three four.

                    JOE
          Is the electrician here?

                    KEVIN
          I just told you -- he hit a deer.

                    JOE
          I hear nothing.  Not a sound on the city
          streets, just the beat of my own heart.
          I think that's the way it goes.
          Something like that.

                    KEVIN
               (beginning to glean something)
          Did you and Patricia get engaged?

                    JOE
          Engaged?  Are you crazy?

                    KEVIN
          I thought you liked Patricia --

                    JOE
          I love Patricia.  Patricia's amazing.
          Patricia makes coffee nervous.
               (suddenly all business)
          Are we still on schedule?

                    KEVIN
          We open two weeks before Thanksgiving.

                    JOE
          I guess we should announce ourselves
          soon.  Tell people we're coming.

                    KEVIN
          This is the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
          The minute they hear they'll be lining up
          --

                    JOE
          -- to picket --

                    KEVIN

                    KEVIN
          -- that destroys --

                    JOE
          -- everything we hold dear.  But we'll
          seduce them with our square footage and
          our deep armchairs and our amazingly
          swift checkout lines and our discounts
          and our...

          -- cappuccino.

                    JOE
          They hate us in the beginning, but we 
          get them in the end.  Meanwhile we 
          should just put up a sign -- Coming soon, 
          a Foxbooks Superstore and The End of
          Western Civilization As We Know It.

     INT. FOXBOOKS - WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

     Joe is in the office with his father, NELSON FOX, and his
     grandfather, SCHUYLER FOX.  The office has been recently
     redecorated; everything is new and a little overdone.

     On the wall we see the Foxbooks logo.

                    JOE
          Kevin and I are both a little concerned
          about the neighborhood response --
               (suddenly notices the garish
                couch)
          What is this fabric?  Does it have a
          name?

                    NELSON
          Money.  Its name is money.

                    JOE
          Gillian selected it.

                    NELSON
          Of course.

                    SCHUYLER
          Your father is getting married again.

                    JOE
          Oh, great, congratulations, Dad.  Why?

                    NELSON
          Who knows?  Why does anyone get married?

                    JOE
          Love.

                    NELSON
          Yes, that is one reason.

                    SCHUYLER
          I think you're a damn fool.

                    NELSON
          Dad, Matthew is four.  It would be nice
          for him if his parents were married.

                    SCHUYLER
          Annabel is eight and I'm not married to
          her mother.  I can't even remember her
          mother's name.
               (he laughs merrily)

                    JOE
          I have a very sad announcement to make.
          City Books on 23rd Street is going under
          ...

     Nelson, Shuyler, and Joe high-five each other.

                    NELSON
          Another independent bookstore bites the
          dust --

                    SCHUYLER
          On to the next.

                    JOE
          And I'm buying their entire stock --
          architecture, New York history -- for the
          new store.

                    NELSON
          How much are your paying?

                    JOE
          Whatever it costs, it won't be as much as
          this exquisite mohair episode.
               (indicates the couch)
          We're also going to have a section on
          West Side Writers --

                    SCHUYLER
          -- as a sop to the neighborhood.

                    NELSON
          Perfect.  It'll keep those West Side
          liberal nut pseudo-intellectual bleeding
          hearts --

                    JOE
          Readers.  They're called readers.

                    NELSON
          Don't romanticize them.  It'll keep them
          from jumping down your throat --

                    SCHUYLER
          What's the competition?

                    JOE
          One mystery store.  Sleuth, on 86th and
          Amsterdam.  And a children's bookstore.
          The Shop Around the Corner.  Been there
          forever.

                    SCHUYLER
          Cecilia's store.

                    JOE
          Who's that?

                    SCHUYLER
          Cecilia Kelly, lovely woman.  I think we
          might have had a date once.  Or maybe we
          just exchange letters.

                    JOE
          You wrote her letters?

                    SCHUYLER
          Mail.  It was called mail.

                    NELSON
               (fondly nostalgic and kidding
                it slightly)
          Stamps.  Envelopes.

                    JOE
          Wait.  I've heard of it.  It was a means
          of communication before I was born.

                    NELSON
          Exactly.

                    SCHUYLER
          Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.
          She was too young for me, but she was...
          enchanting.  Her daughter owns it now.

                    NELSON
          Too bad for her.

     As a DECORATOR walks into the office carrying a pile of
     upholstered pillows, and Joe turns to look at them.

                    COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
          Welcome.  You've got mail.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          My father is getting married again.  For
          five years he's been living with a woman
          who studied decorating at Caesar's
          Palace.

                    COMPUTER VOICE (OVER)
          You've got mail.

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

     Kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through
     the subway car.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          Once I read a story about a butterfly in
          the subway, and today I saw one. I
          couldn't believe it.  It got on at 42nd
          --
               (continued)

     The train comes to a stop.  The butterfly flies out.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          -- and got off at 59th, where I assume it
          was going to Bloomindale's to buy a hat
          that will turn out to be a mistake.  As
          almost all hats are.

     EXT. H & H BAGELS - NIGHT

     A flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Did you know that every night a truck
          pulls up to H&H Bagels and pumps about a
          ton of flour into the ground?  The air is
          absolutely amazing.

     As Joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the
     air.  It is amazing.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I guess I've read Pride & Prejudice about
          100 times --

     INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - DAY

     As Joe reads a copy of Pride and Prejudice.  He can't stand
     it.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          -- and every time I read it I worry that
          Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are not going to
          get together -- but the truth is whenever
          I think about my favorite book I always
          think about the books I read as a child --

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     As Kathleen takes a copy of Homer Price off the shelf.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Did you ever read Homer Price?  My all-
          time favorite children's book.
               (continued)

     She opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that
     won't stop making doughnuts.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          There's a doughnut machine in it that
          won't stop making doughnuts, they just
          keep coming down the chute just as
          regular as a clock can tick.

     EXT. KRISPY KREME STORE - DAY

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          Have you been to Krispy Kreme?
               (continued)

     Joe, eating a doughnut, looks through the window at the huge
     doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as
     regular as a clock can tick.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          There's a doughnut machine right in the
          window that makes 110 dozen doughnuts an
          hour.

     EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

     As Joe leaves with his morning coffee.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NEW YORK - MORNING

     Joe goes to his painter at work: COMING SOON is as far as he's
     gotten.

     EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

     She enters Starbucks.

     INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

     As Kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone
     ordering.

     We can hear the sounds of Starbucks: "Short decaf cap,"  "Tall
     mocha latte."  "Grande lowfat regular."  Etc.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - A HALF HOUR LATER

     The painter is further along on the sign.  It now reads:
     COMING SOON, A FOXBOOKS SU --

     Kathleen walks past the construction site.  She doesn't
     really pay attention to the sign painter.

     We see two police cars barreling up 75th Street, followed by
     a television news truck.

     EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

     The police cars and TV truck barrel uptown.

     EXT. 101st STREET - CONTINUOUS

     They turn left onto West 101st and stop in front of an
     apartment building on the block.  There are more police cars
     and a horde of television reporters with microphones, etc.

     George emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts.

                    TV REPORTER
          The body of a woman was found this
          morning on the roof of a New York
          building...

     As George comes out of his building into a horde of REPORTERS
     with microphones, cameras, etc. and listens to the reporter,
     who, seeing George, sticks the microphone into his face.

                    TV REPORTER
          Here is a resident of the building.  Your
          name, please?

                    GEORGE
          George Pappas.

                    REPORTER
          Did you see or hear anything unusual last
          night?

                    GEORGE
          No.  I didn't go out.

     At that moment, George sees a young woman.  This is MEREDITH
     CARTER.  He is struck dumb.

                    REPORTER
          The victim was red-haired, about thirty-
          five, wearing a jogging suit.  Did you
          encounter anyone by that description
          in the building?  Sir?

     George hasn't heard a word.

                    REPORTER
          Have there been any wild parties 
          lately?

     George doesn't answer.

                    REPORTER
          Could it perhaps be one of your
          neighbors?

     George continues to stare at the beautiful woman.  As he
     does, she notices him.  She stares back.  The reporter,
     ignored, finally turns away.

                    REPORTER
               (to camera)
          As you can see, no one here knows
          anything.

     He continues to stand there, dumbstruck for a moment.
     Meredith Carter starts to walk away.

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

     As George walks along Broadway, past the sign, which now
     says: "COMING SOON: A FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE".  He sees it.

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

     Kathleen and several CUSTOMERS in the store.

     George walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat.
     Christina is unpacking boxes.  Birdie is at the desk.  George
     looks at Christina meaningfully.

                    CHRISTINA
               (totally mystified)
          What?

                    GEORGE
          The coup de foudre. I had one. I
          never believed in them, but I just had
          one.

                    BIRDIE
          Is that the thing where you get cold
          suddenly, bang?

                    CHRISTINA
          No, that's the coup de vieux.

                    BIRDIE
          I had that.

                    GEORGE
          The coup de foudre is where you get
          love suddenly, bang.  A thunderbolt.

                    BIRDIE
          I had that too.  Only I had it in
          Seville, where it was called ,el
          estruendo de amor.

                    GEORGE
          I don't know her name, or anything about
          her.  I may never see her again.

                    CHRISTINA
          And if you ever do meet her, you'll find
          out all the horrible details, and that
          will be that.  She'll turn out to have
          pictures of the Virgin Mary all over the
          walls.

                    GEORGE
          I won't care.

     Kathleen sticks her head into the back.

                    KATHLEEN
          Can someone help me out here?

                    CHRISTINA
          George had a coup de foudre.

                    GEORGE
          And Christina's making fun of me.

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't let her.  I believe in this, I
          completely believe in this.  It happened
          to Madame Bovary, at least six times.

                    CHRISTINA
          And she was wrong every time.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes!
               (beat)
          Who was she?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  She was standing outside
          my building with the police and the
          reporters.

                    KATHLEEN
          What police and reporters?

                    GEORGE
          Someone died.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who?

                    GEORGE
          I have no idea about that either.
          They found her on the roof.

                    KATHLEEN
          A dead body.  That's so sad.  But
          you fell in love.  That's so great.

                    GEORGE
          Oh.  One other thing.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

     The sign is now complete and it says: "Coming soon, just
     around the corner.  A Foxbooks Superstore."

     Kathleen and George and Christina stand there looking at it.

                    CHRISTINA
          Quel nightmare.

                    KATHLEEN
          It has nothing to do with us. It's
          big, impersonal, overstocked and 
          full of ignorant salespeople.

                    GEORGE
          But they discount.

                    KATHLEEN
          But they don't provide any service.  We
          do.

     George and Christina nod.

     INT. BARNEY GREENGRASS - LUNCHTIME

     Kathleen is having lunch with Birdie.

                    KATHLEEN
          So really it's a good development.  You
          know how in the flower district, there
          are all these flower shops in a row so
          you can find whatever you want.  Well,
          this is going to be the book district.
          If you don't have it, we do.

                    BIRDIE
          And vice versa.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DUSK

     Kathleen in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Frank is
     standing there, plugging in an Olympia Report deluxe Electric
     typewriter.

                    FRANK
          When you are finished with Foxbooks, the
          Shop Around the Corner is going to be
          responsible for reversing the entire
          course of the Industrial Revolution.

                    KATHLEEN
          That is so sweet, Frank.  Thank you.
          That is so sweet.

                    FRANK
          Hey --

     He holds his arms out.  They hug.

                    KATHLEEN
          Although...

                    FRANK
          What?

                    KATHLEEN
               (over his shoulder, she notices
                the typewriter, breaks from
                the hug)
          What is that doing there?

                    FRANK
          Listen to it.  Just listen--

     He strikes a key.  Practically swoons.

                    FRANK
          The Olympia Report deluxe Electric
          Report.  As in gunshot.

                    KATHLEEN
          That sound is familiar.

                    FRANK
          Now listen to this.

     He puts his ear to the typewriter.

     Kathleen listens too.

                    KATHLEEN
          That whirring?

                    FRANK
          The gentle and soothing lullaby of a
          piece of machinery so perfect --

                    KATHLEEN
          I know where I've heard it before.  I
          know.

     She whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table.
     It's the same machine exactly.

                    FRANK
          I needed a backup.

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't you have another one at your
          apartment?

                    FRANK
          I might, I might.  So what?

                    KATHLEEN
          You're turning my apartment into a
          typewriter museum.

                    FRANK
          I'll stop.  I'll try.  I probably can't.
          I see one and my knees go weak.  Anyway,
          what were you starting to say?

                    KATHLEEN
          When?

                    FRANK
          Before.

                    KATHLEEN
          Nothing.

                    FRANK
          Come on.

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't know.  I was just wondering about
          my work and all.  I mean, what is it I do
          exactly?  All I really do is run a 
          bookstore --

                    FRANK
          All you really do is this incredibly
          noble thing --

     Kathleen nods.

                    KATHLEEN
          But I don't know if I --

                    FRANK
               (stopping her)
          Kathleen --

                    KATHLEEN
          But I just --

                    FRANK
          You are a lone reed.

     Kathleen looks puzzled.

     He sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter, starts typing.

                    FRANK
          You are a lone reed waving in the 
          breeze standing strong and tall in 
          the corrupt sands of commerce.

     He whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands
     it to her.

                    KATHLEEN
               (reading from it)
          I am a lone reed.
               (tries it on again)
          I am a lone reed.

     Clutching her piece of paper, she wanders into the bathroom.

     INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

     We hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the
     next room.

     Kathleen walks past her computer, looks at it.  Then she goes
     over to the window, looks out at her street at dusk.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DUSK

     A group of schoolgirls in uniform, in two straight lines,
     walk past with a tall woman.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DUSK

     She goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of
     Madeleine by Ludwig Bemelmans and opens it to the
     illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight lines
     marching through the streets of Paris.  She looks at it, then
     looks up, lost in thought.  We hear the sound of the computer
     keys.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          Sometimes I wonder about my life.  I lead
          a small life.  Well, not small, but
          circumscribed.  And sometimes I wonder,
          do I do it because I like it, or because
          I haven't been brave?  So much of what I
          see reminds me of something I read in a
          book, when shouldn't it be the other way
          around?
               (continued)

     And hold on her as she thinks about this.

     In the other room, we hear Frank typing.

     Kathleen goes to the computer, turns it on.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     As we see Kathleen, through her curtains, a small figure
     barely lit by her computer.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          I don't really want an answer.  I just
          want to send this cosmic question out
          into the void.  So goodnight, dear void.

     INT. DRIP - DAY

     Drip is a cafe on Amsterdam Avenue with Fifties-style couches
     and chairs in cozy seating arrangements.  Kathleen is
     standing at the front counter with Christina, getting drinks.

                    CHRISTINA
          I went to the Foxbooks Website and you
          can buy anything.  They ship it to you
          in a day.  Maybe we should get a website.

                    KATHLEEN
          My mother would never have wanted us to
          have a website.  "Every book you sell is
          a gift from your heart."  She always said
          that.

     As they walk toward the back of the cafe, Kathleen notices a 
     stack of loose-leaf binders on the table.

                    CHRISTINA
          What if they put us out of business?

                    KATHLEEN
          It's out of the question.  We're a
          fixture in the neighborhood.  We're
          practically a landmark.
               (indicating the binders)
          Men For Women, Women for Men, Women for
          Women -- what is this?

                    CHRISTINA
          You fill out one of these forms and they
          file it in the book and if someone wants
          to meet you, they arrange it.

                    KATHLEEN
          What a stupid way to meet someone.

                    CHRISTINA
          Compared to the Internet?

                    KATHLEEN
          My little thing on the Internet is just
          a lark.

                    CHRISTINA
          So it's still going on?

                    KATHLEEN
          And I do not plan to meet him.
               (indicating the book)
          Why do I get the feeling that you are in
          here somewhere?

     Christina flips the book open to her application.

                    CHRISTINA
          I came in here one night and drank too
          much coffee and filled one out.
               (off Kathleen's look)
          Well how am I supposed to meet someone?

                    KATHLEEN
          You are a runner.  Some day you will make
          eye contact with another runner and --

                    CHRISTINA
          No one ever even looks at me.  They
          don't.  On top of which, who are they?
          They could like the symphony.  I could
          never fall in love with someone who 
          likes to go to the symphony --

                    KATHLEEN
          I know.  What are you supposed to do
          there?

                    CHRISTINA
          I don't know.

                    KATHLEEN
          Sit.  You're supposed to sit.

                    CHRISTINA
          I could never fall in love with anyone
          who smokes cigars either.

                    KATHLEEN
          I'll tell you what I hate.  Big fat legs
          like stumps.

                    CHRISTINA
          Yeah.  I hate that too.

                    KATHLEEN
          The worst, the worst -- I could never,
          under any circumstances, love anybody
          who had a sailboat.

                    CHRISTINA
          Neither could I.

                    KATHLEEN
          If I had to get up on Saturday morning
          knowing that I was about to go down to
          the pier and unravel all those ropes and
          put on all that sunblock --

                    CHRISTINA
          All that talk about the wind.

                    KATHLEEN
          And then you have to go out on the boat,
          and you sail and sail and sail until you
          are bored witless, and then, only then,
          do they say, let's turn around and you
          realize the trip is only half over, only
          it's not, because the wind has changed --

                    CHRISTINA
          It hasn't changed.  It's died.

                    KATHLEEN
          So then there's more talk about the wind.
          While you just float up and down trying
          not to get nauseous.  And when you
          finally get back, you have to clean up
          the boat.

                    CHRISTINA
          Why don't people have boat maids?

                    KATHLEEN
          I know.  There're all these people who
          wouldn't be caught dead polishing a
          doorknob in their house but put them on 
          a boat and they want to rub down 
          everything in sight.
          
     EXT. 19TH STREET BOAT BASIN - ANOTHER DAY

     Joe is on his sailboat.  He is polishing his brass and
     whistling.

                    ANNABEL
          Joe --

     Joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his
     grandfather's daughter ANNABEL, 8, who is coming toward the
     dock with GILLIAN, his father's overdecorated 32-year-old
     fiance, her son, MATTHEW, 4, and the Nanny, MAUREEN.

                    JOE
          Hello.
               (picks up Annabel)
          Annabel, how are you today?

                    ANNABEL
          Great.

                    JOE
               (picks up Matt)
          Hey, big guy --

                    GILLIAN
          Don't I get a hello?

                    JOE
          Hello, Gillian.

                    GILLIAN
          Kiss me.  I'm going to be your wicked
          stepmother.

     Joe gives her a peck on the cheek.

                    JOE
          Who is this?

                    GILLIAN
          Nanny Maureen.  I brought her in case
          you couldn't handle the kids.

                    ANNABEL
          Maureen's getting a divorce.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry to hear that.

                    MAUREEN
          It's my own fault.  Never marry a man
          who lies.

                    JOE
          That is so wise.  Remember that, Annabel.

                    ANNABEL
          She taught Matt to spell his name.

                    MATT
          Fox. F-O-X.

                    JOE
          Excellent, Matt.
               (to Maureen)
          Good work.  You can have the day off.
          I'll take over from here.
               (to Gillian)
          You must be late for something.
          Volunteer work at the Henry Street
          Settlement.  Packing bandages for
          Bosnian refugees.  A course in 
          Chinese literature at Columbia.

                    GILLIAN
          I am.  I'm having my eggs harvested.

     EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY

     There's a block street fair with little booths, sausage
     sandwich concessions, etc.  Annabel and Matt have been to the
     makeup booth.  Annabel is a cat and Matt is a pirate.
     Annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward
     Broadway.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

     As Joe, Annabel and Matt walk past.  There's some sort of toy
     miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store
     and a sign lit with twinkle lights: Storybook Lady today 3:30.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - DAY

     Kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of CHILDREN,
     including Annabel and Matt, who are crammed into her store.
     Joe is watching, along with some PARENTS as Kathleen reads 
     from a Roald Dahl book.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S STORE - LATER

     Matt is sitting on the floor reading a book.  Kathleen is 
     showing Annabel a copy of a book called Betsy-Tacy.

                    KATHLEEN
          This is her best friend Tacy, whose real
          name is Anastasia, and then in the next
          book Betsy and Tacy become friends with
          Tib, whose real name, I am sorry to tell
          you, is Thelma.

     In another section of the store:

     George is showing Joe a first edition of Swiss Family
     Robinson from the glass case.

                    GEORGE
          The illustrations are hand-tipped,
          which is why --

                    JOE
          It costs so much.

                    GEORGE
          It's why it's worth so much.

     Joe smiles and turns to see Kathleen and Annabel at a whole
     shelf of Betsy-Tacy books.

                    ANNABEL
          I want all of them.

                    KATHLEEN
          That might be an awful lot for your dad
          to buy at one time.

                    ANNABEL
          My dad gets me all the books I want.

                    KATHLEEN
               (looking over at Joe)
          Well, that's very nice of him.

                    ANNABEL
          That's not my dad.  That's my nephew --

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, I don't really think that's your
          nephew --

     As Joe approaches.

                    JOE
          It's true.  Annabel is my aunt.  Aren't
          you, Aunt Annabel?

     Annabel nods solemnly.

                    ANNABEL
          And Matt is --

                    KATHLEEN
          Let me guess.
               (to Matt)
          Are you his uncle?

                    MATT
          No.

                    KATHLEEN
          His grandfather?

     Annabel and Matt start giggling.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          His great-grandfather?

                    MATT
               (shouting with glee)
          I'm his brother.

                    JOE
          Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.
          And Matt is my father's son.  We are an
          American family.

     He smiles at Kathleen, who finds herself smiling back.

     Annabel suddenly sneezes.

     Kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  It's an old
     fashioned hankie that's embroidered.  She offers it to
     Annabel, who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then
     looks at the handkerchief, a little puzzled.

                    ANNABEL
          What is that?

                    KATHLEEN
          A handkerchief.  Oh my, do children not
          even know what handkerchiefs are?  A
          handkerchief is a Kleenex you don't throw
          away.  My mother embroidered it for me --
          you see?  My initials and a daisy, 
          because daisies are my favorite flower.

                    ANNABEL
          Orchids are my favorite flower.

                    KATHLEEN
               (to Joe)
          You know what else children don't know?
          They don't know what a telephone booth
          is?

     Joe is looking at Kathleen.

                    JOE
          Who are you?

                    KATHLEEN
          Kathleen Kelly.  I own this store.
          Are you are?

                    JOE
          Joe.  Just call me Joe.
               (quickly)
          We'll take these books.

     He gets the one Matt is reading.  And the two other Kathleen
     has gotten for Annabel.

                    KATHLEEN
          These are wonderful books.  As Annabel
          gets older the characters in the books do,
          too.
               (to Annabel)
          You can grow up with Betsy.

                    GEORGE
          You're going to come back again, aren't
          you?

                    JOE
          Of course.

                    GEORGE
          This is why we're never going to go
          under.  Our customers are loyal.

                    KATHLEEN
               (by way of explanation)
          They're opening a Foxbooks around the
          corner.

                    ANNABEL
          Foxbooks!  My Daddy --

                    JOE
               (gently putting his hand over
                her mouth)
          -- likes to buy at discount.  Don't tell
          anyone that, Annabel, it's nothing to be
          proud of --

                    MATT
               (spelling)
          F-O-X.

                    KATHLEEN
          That's amazing.  You can spell fox.  Can
          you spell dog?

                    MATT
          F-O-X.

                    JOE
          Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
          Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
          Annabel, maybe you could read this to
          Matt while I wrap things up here.
               (moves them to a corner, to
                them quickly)
          Sit down, read, and don't listen to
          anything I say.

     Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.

                    JOE
          And the dinosaur book too.

                    KATHLEEN
          The world is not driven by discounts,
          believe me.  I've been in business
          forever.  I started helping my mother
          here after school when I was six years
          old.  I used to watch her, and it wasn't
          that she was selling books, it was that
          she was helping people become whoever
          they were going to turn out to be.  When
          you read a book as a child it becomes
          part of your identity in a way that no
          other reading in your life does.
               (stops herself)
          I guess I've gotten carried away.

                    JOE
          You have, and you've made me feel...

     He can't finish the sentence.  He looks at her and sees,
     behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
     unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Enchanting, your mother was enchanting.

                    KATHLEEN
          She was.  How did you know that?

                    JOE
          Lucky guess.

                    KATHLEEN
          Anyway.  She left the store to me, and
          I'm going to leave it to my daughter.

                    JOE
          How old is your daughter now?

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, I'm not married.  But eventually.

     She smiles at Joe...

                    KATHLEEN
          So Foxbooks can...

                    KATHLEEN AND GEORGE TOGETHER
          Go to hell.

                    KATHLEEN
               (handing him his books)
          Here you go.

                    JOE
          We ready?

     Annabel and Matt join him at the counter.  Kathleen gives them
     each a lollipop.

                    ANNABEL
          Bye, Kathleen.

                    KATHLEEN
          Goodbye, Annabel.  Bye, Matt.  What
          about cat?  Can you spell cat?

                    MATT
          F-O-X.

     INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

     Someplace like the auditorium at the Museum of Broadcasting.
     PATRICIA EDEN, Joe's girlfriend, who is the editor-in-chief
     of a New York publishing house called Eden Books, is standing
     at a podium at a sales conference.  In the audience are sales
     reps, wholesalers, etc.  There's a screen behind her with
     pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          And now, the book you've all been waiting
          for, the book it's been my dreams to
          publish.  The legendary Veronica Grant
          has written her memoirs --

     There's a burst of applause as a photograph of Veronica Grant
     flashes on screen.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          -- and I'm happy to report it is just
          crammed with tragedy.
               (she laughs gaily)
          Just kidding, but seriously, it's all
          here: poverty, addiction, divorce,
          tracheotomies --

     We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
     family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
     series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          -- her third husband beat her up, hip
          replacement, and an amazing face lift
          where all the injected fat fell to her
          chin.

     Now we see a blow-up of the book's jacket, with a picture of
     Veronica on it and the title: "Am I Rising from Ashes, or Did
     I Just Forget to Dust?"

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          This book is fabulous.  And even if it
          weren't, it would sell like crazy,
          because Veronica is going to plug it to
          death on every talk show in America.
          This book...

     Patricia bursts into tears.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          I'm sorry.  I can't talk about it without
          crying.  Veronica and I have so much in
          common -- well, not all the sad parts --
          but we were both famous by the time we
          were 29 and, believe me, that's rough.
               (wipes her nose with a Kleenex,
                pulling herself together)
          Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
          especially thrilled to be publishing it.
          Veronica lives in my building and we met
          in the elevator.  By the time we had
          traveled from the eighth floor to the
          first, we had a deal.  First printing:
          one million copies.

     Everyone applauds enthusiastically.

     INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - A SHORT WHILE LATER

     Patricia is leaving, still surrounded by colleagues and sales
     reps congratulating her.  She is the soul of graciousness.
     Her assistant, Sarah, comes up.

                    SARAH
               (quickly)
          You have a dentist appointment in twenty 
          minutes.  So you should leave soon...

                    PATRICIA
          What's my car number?

                    SARAH
          Car?  You didn't say anything about a car
          --

                    PATRICIA
          Are you an idiot?  Of course I need a car.
          God!

     She walks toward the exit.

     EXT. 57TH STREET - CONTINUOUS

     Patricia in the pouring rain, trying to hail a cab.  She
     spots one across the street.

                    PATRICIA
          Taxi!  Taxi!  Taxi!

     She whistles -- a longshoreman's whistle.

     The cab makes a U-turn, but instead of stopping for Patricia
     it stops about twenty feet ahead for a MAN in an overcoat who
     gets into it.

                    PATRICIA
          Excuse me -- what are you doing?  This is
          my taxicab.
               (to the driver)
          Don't take him.  I am telling you right
          now, and I am memorizing your number,
          don't take him.
               (to the man)
          Who the fuck do you think you are?

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          Are you going uptown?

                    PATRICIA
          Yes.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          Get in.  I'll drop you.

     INT. TAXI - A MINUTE LATER

     As the cab turns onto Eighth Avenue, starts uptown.

     Patricia is dialing her cell phone.  She's elaborately
     ignoring the man who stole her cab.

                    PATRICIA
          Veronica, it's Patricia, you should have
          been there, it was unbelievable, we're
          going to sell truckloads of your book.
          Call me.

     She hangs up, folds up the phone, puts it back in her purse
     as the cab moves on.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          Are you an editor?

                    PATRICIA
          Yes.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          I am a rabbi.

                    PATRICIA
          Oh, my God, I said fuck to a rabbi.  I'm
          sorry.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          I hope you don't mind my asking, but are
          you Jewish?

                    PATRICIA
          Yes.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          You should come to our temple.

                    PATRICIA
          I'm not really religious.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          Oh, I am surprised, you seem like a very
          religious person.

                    PATRICIA
          You're kidding, right?

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          We are at West End Avenue and 83rd
          Street.  Every Friday night, we have a
          joyous time, everyone dancing, everyone
          singing.  Also some wisdom.  Perhaps you
          have heard of us, we are known as The
          Singles Temple.

     He smiles at her.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          It's a very good place to calm down.

     The cab stops.

                    MAN IN OVERCOAT
          Oh, look, I am already here.  Very nice
          to meet you.
               (gives the cabbie money)
          Take this woman to her destination.

     He gets out.  Closes the door.  A beat too late:

                    PATRICIA
          Goodbye.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Frank comes up the stoop.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Kathleen is dressed up for a party.

     Frank walks in, looks meaningfully at her.

                    FRANK
          I saw him.  I actually saw him.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who?

                    FRANK
          I can't believe it.  I saw William
          Spungeon.

                    KATHLEEN
          I thought he was in Mexico.

                    FRANK
          Maybe he's in Mexico, but today he was in
          New York.  The most brilliant and
          reclusive novelist in the history of the
          world is here, in this neighborhood.  He
          may be living on this very block.

                    KATHLEEN
          Where did you see him?

                    FRANK
          I was on the subway --

     INT. SUBWAY - DAY

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          -- and this musician got onto the train --

     Frank is sitting on the subway, reading the Village Voice.
     The door between the cars opens and a man playing the 
     clarinet enters the car.

     No one looks up except Frank.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          -- and I suddenly saw him, sitting
          directly across from me doing the
          crossword puzzle.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          How'd you know it was him?

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          He looked exactly the same as his high
          school yearbook picture, which happens to
          be the last photograph ever taken of him.

     Frank takes out his billfold on the subway, pulls out a piece
     of paper.

     CLOSE UP - FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER

     As Frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture
     of William Spungeon at 17.

     Frank compares the photo of Spungeon with the person sitting
     across the way.  They don't look remotely alike except that
     the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both
     wearing the same style glasses.

     The subway stops at 79th Street, and William Spungeon gets off.
     Frank follows.

     EXT. BROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

     As Frank comes out of the subway station and looks around.

                    FRANK
          So I followed him.

     Frank sees Spungeon cross 79th.  He follows.

     EXT. H&H BAGELS - CONTINUOUS

     Frank follows Spungeon, who hurries into H&H Bagels passing a
     HOMELESS MAN holding a paper cup at the door.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          He went into H&H and bought a bagel
          with everything.

     EXT. H&H BAGELS - A MINUTE LATER

     As Spungeon leaves the store, passing the paper cup, which we
     now realize that Frank, in dark glasses, is holding.

     Spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          He dropped his crossword into the 
          garbage and I rescued it.

     Frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan, follows Spungeon.

     INT. SPORTING GOOD STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Spungeon at the counter in the shoe store.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          Then he went into a sporting good store
          and bought tube socks, 6 pair for $7.99.

     We see Frank, peeking out at him from behind a stack of
     running pants.  Suddenly he's distracted by a couple of
     joggers.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          William Spungeon and tube socks.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          I know.  I don't want to dwell on it.

     Frank looks back at the counter.  Spungeon's gone.

                    FRANK (V.O.)
          And then I lost him.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

     Frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of Kathleen.

                    FRANK
          Do you know what this is worth?

     He takes an empty instant-frame from the closet, puts the
     puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters.

     INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     As the two of them eat dinner.

                    FRANK
          What I was thinking as I was trailing him
          was that eventually I would have the
          courage to say hello to him, you know,
          not in a horrible, intrusive or slavering
          fan-slash-acolyte kind of way, but more
          like, "Hi."  "How ya doing?"  "Have you
          ever thought about trading up in the sock
          area?"  "Who knows, maybe he's read my
          work -- and then we'd become friends, and
          eventually I'd introduce him to you --
          you know how much he loves children's
          books, there's a whole long section in
          Relativity's Smile about The Wizard of Oz
          -- and then maybe he'd come out of hiding
          so he could help save the store.

                    KATHLEEN
          What are you talking about?

                    FRANK
          From Foxbooks.  I mean, if things got
          tough, he could help rally support --

                    KATHLEEN
          It's never going to get to that.  The
          store is fine.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     As they walk along after dinner.

                    FRANK
          I don't even know why you would say that?

                    KATHLEEN
          Neither do I.  It just flew out of my
          mouth.

                    FRANK
          There's enough business for us all.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     As they go up in an elevator.

                    KATHLEEN
          I mean, we're fine.

                    FRANK
          You're more than fine, you're absolutely
          fine.

                    KATHLEEN
          We're fine.

     The elevator opens onto:

     INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A publication party for an author named VINCE MANCINI.  A mix
     of book people, journalists and various other media folk.

                    FRANK
          Hey, Vince.  Congratulations.  You know
          Kathleen Kelly.

                    VINCE
          How are you?

                    FRANK
          Guess who I saw today on the subway?
          William Spungeon.

                    VINCE
          I thought he was in Mexico.

     They start chatting.

     Across the room, Joe is with Patricia, who is telling two
     other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab.
     Joe looks over and sees Kathleen.  He suddenly looks
     stricken.

     Shifts his position so Kathleen can't see his face, but
     sneaks a look.

                    PATRICIA
          Would you get me another drink, sweetie?
          I'm all out.
               (continues chattering)
          So then the rabbi says, "It's a very good
          place to calm down."  Isn't that
          hysterical?

     They all laugh.  Joe moves over to the bar.

                    JOE
          Absolut on the rocks.

     As he is waiting, Kathleen comes up next to him.

                    KATHLEEN
          A white wine, please.
               (very friendly)
          Oh, hello.

                    JOE
          Hi.

                    KATHLEEN
          Remember me, from the bookstore?

                    JOE
          Of course I remember you.

                    KATHLEEN
          How's your aunt?

                    JOE
          Good.  She's good.
               (gets his drink)
          I have to deliver this.  I have a very
          thirsty date.  She's part camel.

     Kathleen laughs.

                    KATHLEEN
          Joe.  It's Joe, isn't it?

                    JOE
          And you're Kathleen.

     Joe vanishes into the party.

     INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - A MINUTE LATER

                    VINCE
          I can't believe you were talking to Joe
          Fox.

                    KATHLEEN
          Joe Fox?  As in --

     She can't even finish the sentence.

     INT. VINCE MANCINI'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

     Joe is standing at a table of food, his back to the room.

                    KATHLEEN
          Fox?  Your last name is Fox?

     Joe spins around, looks at her.

                    JOE
          F-O-X.

                    KATHLEEN
          God, I didn't realize.  I didn't know who
          you --
               (she trails off)

                    JOE
          -- were with.
               (quoting)
          "I didn't know who you were with."

                    KATHLEEN
          Excuse me?

                    JOE
          It's from the Godfather.  When the movie
          producer realizes that Tom Hagen is the
          emissary of Vito Corleone --
               (continued)

     Kathleen is staring at him.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          -- just before the horse's head ends up
          in his bed never mind --

                    KATHLEEN
          You were spying on me, weren't you?  You
          probably rented those children.

                    JOE
          Why would I spy on you?

                    KATHLEEN
          I am your competition.  Which you know
          perfectly well or you would not have put
          up that sign saying "Just around the
          Corner."

                    JOE
          The entrance to our store is around the
          corner.  There is no other way to say it.
          It's not the name of our store, it's
          where it is.  You don't own "around the
          corner."

                    KATHLEEN
          Next thing you'll be using twinkle
          lights.

                    JOE
          Twinkle lights?

                    KATHLEEN
          Little white Christmas lights that
          twinkle.  I use them in my window and on
          all my displays, as if you didn't notice.

                    JOE
          Look, the reason I came into your store
          is that I was spending the day with
          Annabel and Matt.  I like to buy them a
          present when I see them because I'm one
          of those guys who likes to buy his way
          into the hearts of children who are his
          relatives.  There was only one place to
          buy children's books in the neighborhood
          -- although that will not always be the
          case, and it was yours, and it is a
          charming little bookstore.  You probably
          sell $250,000 worth of book a year --

                    KATHLEEN
          How do you know that?

                    JOE
          I'm in the book business.

                    KATHLEEN
          I'm in the book business --

                    JOE
          Oh, I see, and we're the Price Club.
          Only instead of a ten-gallon can of olive
          oil for $3.99 that won't even fit into
          your kitchen cabinet, we're selling cheap
          books.  Me a spy.
               (beat)
          Absolutely.  And I managed to get my hands
          on a secret printout of the sales figures
          of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet
          full of its own virtue that I was instantly
          compelled to rush over and check it out
          for fear it would drive me out of business 
          --

     Kathleen stares at him.  She's speechless.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          What?
               (off her look)
          What?

     Kathleen shakes her head.

     Frank turns up.

                    FRANK
          Hi.  I'm Frank Navasky --

                    JOE
          -- Joe Fox.

                    FRANK
          Joe Fox?  Inventor of the Superstore,
          enemy of the mid-list novel, destroyer of
          City Books -- tell me something:
          How do you sleep at night?

     Patricia joins them.

                    PATRICIA
          I use a wonderful over-the-counter drug,
          Ultrasom.  Don't take the whole thing,
          just half, and you will wake up without
          even that tiniest hangover.  You're Frank
          Navasky, aren't you?

                    FRANK
          Yes.

                    PATRICIA
          Your last piece in the Independent, the
          one about Anthony Powell, was brilliant.
          I'm Patricia Eden, Eden Books.  Joe, this
          man is the greatest living expert on
          Julius and Ethel Rosenberg --

                    JOE
          And this is Kathleen Kelly --

     Kathleen glares at him.

                    FRANK
          You liked my piece.  God, I'm flattered.
          You know you write these things and you
          think someone's going to mention them and
          then the whole week goes by and the phone
          doesn't ring, and you think Oh, God, I'm
          a fraud, a failure --

                    PATRICIA
          You know what's always fascinated me
          about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg is how
          old they looked when they were really
          just our age.

     Everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at
     Patricia, who smiles at them all.

                    PATRICIA
               (to Frank)
          I'm so happy to have finally met you.  We
          will talk.  Have you ever thought about
          doing a book?

                    FRANK
          Oh sure, it's passed through my head.
          Something really relevant for today like
          the Luddite movement in 19th century
          England.

     At the same time:

                    JOE
          Patricia --

                    KATHLEEN
          Frank --

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     As Kathleen and Frank get into bed.

                    FRANK
          I really like Patricia Eden.  She's a
          very nice person.

     Kathleen doesn't respond.  Frank turns out the light.

                    FRANK
          She needs educating, that's all.

     A beat.

                    FRANK
          She's hopelessly driven by money and
          power, but there's a hope for anyone 
          who's that familiar with my work --

     On Kathleen, as she turns away from Frank and lies there,
     eyes open.

     INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     As Joe and Patricia get into bed.  Brinkley is already on the
     bed.

                    PATRICIA
          I had no idea that Frank Navasky was so
          down-to-earth.

     Joe doesn't respond.  Patricia turns out the light.

                    PATRICIA
          You read his stuff, you think he's going
          to be so obscure and abstruse.

     A beat.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          He's always talking about Heidigger and
          Foucault and I have no idea what any of
          it's about, really.

     Joe gets up.  Brinkley follows.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          Where are you going?

                    JOE
          I'm not really tired.

     INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

     Joe writes on his computer.  Brinkley on the floor next to him.

     And cut between Joe and his computer screen.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Do you ever feel you become the worst
          version of yourself?  That a Pandora's
          Box of all the secret hateful parts --
          your arrogance, your spite, your
          condescension -- has sprung open.
          Someone provokes you, and instead of 
          just smiling and moving on, you zing 
          them.  Hello, it's Mr. Nasty.  I'm sure 
          you have no idea what I'm talking about.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY

     And cut between screen and

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     As Kathleen reads the end of Joe's letter.

     Kathleen hits the Reply key and starts to type:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I know what you mean and I'm completely
          jealous.  What happens to me when I'm
          provoked is that I get tongue-tied.  My
          mind goes blank.  Then I spend all night
          tossing and turning trying to think of
          what I should have said.

     INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

     As he replies:

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could pass
          all my zingers to you and then I would
          never behave badly and you could behave
          badly all the time and we'd both be
          happy?  On the other hand, I must warn
          you that when you finally have the
          pleasure of saying the thing you mean to
          say at the moment you mean to say it,
          remorse inevitably follows.  Do you think
          we should meet?

     INT. KATHLEEN'S COMPUTER SCREEN AND BEDROOM - DAY

     Kathleen stares at Joe's letter in her computer.

     She's frozen.

                    KATHLEEN
          Meet?  Omigod.

     She sits staring at the letter.  She has no idea what to do.

     EXT. 75TH STREET & COLUMBUS - DAY

     As the iron gates on all the stores start to open, just the
     way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie.
     The pharmacy.  The optician.  The cosmetics supply store.
     The video store.

     And now, finally, we see the new grate on the new Foxbooks
     Superstore start to open upwards.  This is the finest grate
     on Broadway, no question of it.  It's electric and almost
     soundless.  We see a sign saying, OPENING DAY.  35% OFF ON
     ALL BEST-SELLERS.

     People on the street notice the store.  One walks in...

     CAMERA follows him...

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     The inside is beautiful.  Gleaning staircase, a cafe,
     comfortable chairs to sit, a bank of cashiers, everyone
     decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the
     alligator should be, a rope for the checkout line, and seven
     cash registers with seven cashiers.  Of course, books, books,
     books, as far as the eye can see.

     MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SAME SCENE - LATER THAT DAY

     The store is jam-packed.  Joe with his father Nelson, his
     grandfather Schuyler, and Kevin, the store manager.

                    JOE
          No pickets, no demonstrations.

                    KEVIN
          The neighborhood loves us.

                    NELSON
          They're wondering where we've been all
          these years.  They're wondering how they
          ever did without it.

                    SCHUYLER
          It's a hit.

     They admire their own store, walk through the downstairs and
     start up the staircase to the second floor.

                    NELSON
          How's the children's book department?

                    JOE
          It's early yet.  School isn't out.  And
          there's that children's bookstore nearby
          --

                    SCHUYLER
          Cecilia's store --

                    JOE
          Her daughter's --

                    NELSON
          We'll crush it --

                    SCHUYLER
          She was enchanting.

     And as they walk on upstairs, several mothers with children
     come up the stairs behind them.

     EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING

     A little group of children dressed as Pilgrims walk down the
     street as Kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning
     paper.  Joe is at the newsstand.  She turns and pretends to
     be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and
     walks on.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I don't think it's a good idea for us
          to meet...

     INT. STARBUCKS - ANOTHER DAY

     Joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as
     Kathleen comes in.  He pretends he didn't see her.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          I love our relationship.  There's a lot
          going on in the day-to-dayness of my life
          and there's something magical...

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

     We see Kathleen and George at the end of the day, counting
     the receipts.  Birdie is using a calculator to total them.
     Christina is shelving books.  There are Thanksgiving
     decorations -- cardboard turkeys and pilgrims, books on
     colonists like Myles Standish.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          ... and thrilling about this island in
          cyberspace I have with you.  SO PLEASE
          DON'T ASK ME AGAIN.

                    BIRDIE
          About $1200 less than the same week last
          year.

                    KATHLEEN
          That could be a fluke, right?

     They look at each other.

                    BIRDIE
          Or not.

                    KATHLEEN
          Their store is new.  It's a novelty.  But
          it will all shake out.  Do you think I
          should put up more twinkle lights?

                    BIRDIE
          That's a lovely idea.

                    CHRISTINA
          What if we have to fold?  I'll never find
          another part time job and I won't be able
          to pay the rent and I'll have to move to
          Brooklyn.

                    GEORGE
          The joy of rent control.  Six room for
          $450 a month.

                    CHRISTINA
          We know.  You've told us a million times.
          I can't believe you're bringing it up at
          a time like this.  It's like bragging
          because you're tall.  Birdie never brags
          about her rent and she pays even less
          than you.

                    BIRDIE
          Ten rooms.  I just rattle around from one
          to the other.

                    KATHLEEN
          Hey, guys.  We are not going to fold.

     The door opens, and Meredith Carter, the woman George had
     swooned over in front of his building, walks in.

     George stares, frozen in place, as she walks up to him.

                    MEREDITH
          George Pappas?

                    GEORGE
               (I have died and gone to
                heaven)
          Yes.

                    MEREDITH
               (flashing her badge)
          Detective Carter, 23rd precinct.  I'd
          like to ask you a few questions.

     Kathleen suddenly sees George, following Meredith out of the
     store.  He's in a complete daze.

                    KATHLEEN
          George?  Where are you going?

     He goes out the door.

     LAURA MARGULIES, a well-known children's book author, enters
     as George leaves.

                    LAURA
          Kathleen, are you surviving?

                    KATHLEEN
          Laura!  We're so excited about your new
          book.  When should we schedule your
          signing?

                    LAURA
          Oh, it's being published in January.
          Are you going to be in business in
          January?  I'm so worried.

                    KATHLEEN
          We're doing great, aren't we?

                    CHRISTINA
          Great.

                    BIRDIE
          No difference whatsoever.

                    LAURA
          Thank God.  Well, you know you can count
          on me.  For anything, support, rallies.
          Picket lines.  We can get the Times to
          write something.  Or that nut in the
          Independent --

                    KATHLEEN
          What nut in the Independent?

                    LAURA
          Frank Navasky.  This is just the sort of
          thing that would outrage him.

     She smiles brightly.

     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     George and Meredith are sitting in a booth.

                    MEREDITH
          Mr. Pappas, I'm investigating the murder
          of the woman found on the roof of your
          building.  Do you live alone there?

                    GEORGE
          Do I live alone?  Yes I do.  Do you live
          alone?

                    MEREDITH
          Yes.

     George takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were
     the eighth wonder of the world.  He starts stroking it,
     caressing it...

     Meredith pulls it away.  A beat.  Then she gives it right
     back to him.  He continues stroking.  They stare at each
     other.  He puts her fingers into his mouth.

          MEREDITH
               (overwhelmed)
          What are you doing?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  I have no idea.

                    MEREDITH
          You have to stop.

                    GEORGE
          I can't.

     She utters a little moan.

     INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT - A SHORT WHILE LATER

     They come into the apartment.  She throws herself into his
     arms.

     EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - DAY

     As Christina runs, desperately trying to make eye contact
     with men running in the opposite direction.  No one will look
     at her.

     INT. ZABAR'S CHEESE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

     The place is mobbed -- the usual crush the night before
     Thanksgiving.

     Kathleen, pushing a shopping cart, is trying to wedge her way
     through the crowd in the cheese department.  As she reaches
     across three people to grab some Brie, she sees Joe walk into
     the store.  Quickly, she turns her back so he can't see her.
     She stands there frozen.  A beat...

     Peeks around, doesn't see him anywhere.  Cranes her neck this
     way and that.  No Joe.

     INT. ZABAR'S CASHIER AREA - CONTINUOUS

     Kathleen, now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all
     disguised, looks around and spots a short line and makes a
     beeline for it.

     At that moment, Joe comes from the Appetizing Department and
     gets on the line she was heading for.

     Panicked, Kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with
     her back to him.

     INT. SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

     The CASHIER totals up Kathleen's purchases and Kathleen hands
     over her credit card.

                    CASHIER
          This is a Cash Only line.

                    KATHLEEN
          What?

                    CASHIER
          Cash Only.

                    KATHLEEN
          Omigod, I only have a credit card.  Is
          that okay?

                    PERSON BEHIND HER IN LINE
          Of course it's not okay, there's a sign.

                    CASHIER
          There's a sign.

                    PERSON IN LINE
               (to the person behind her)
          She doesn't have cash.

     "She doesn't have cash" is repeated all the way down the
     line.

     Joe turns to see what's going on.

                    ANOTHER PERSON
          Get on another line, lady.

                    JOE
          Oh, hello.

                    KATHLEEN
          Hello.

                    JOE
          Do you need some money?

                    KATHLEEN
          No, I don't need any money.  Thank you
          very much.

                    CASHIER
          Get on another line.

                    JOE
          Hi.
               (off her nametag, big smile)
          Rose. Great name.  Rose, this is
          Kathleen, I'm Joe, and this is a credit
          card machine.  Happy Thanksgiving.

     Rose just stares at him.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Now it's your turn to say happy
          Thanksgiving back.

                    ROSE
          Happy Thanksgiving back.

     Joe looks at her, winks.

                    JOE
          Mississippi is a hard word to spell.  How
          do you spell it?  I-T.
               (big smile)
          Now take this credit card and put it
          through the machine, zip zip.

     The cashier, completely charmed, takes Kathleen's credit
     card.

     Kathleen is appalled.

     Everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly.

                    JOE
          So you're fine.

                    KATHLEEN
          Fine.

                    JOE
          Happy Thanksgiving.

     As Kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly
     starts to put her groceries into a bag.

     INT. JOE'S FATHER'S APARTMENT - THANKSGIVING DAY

     An elegant East Side apartment.  Schuyler, his youngish
     French wife, YVETTE, Nelson, Gillian and their child Matt,
     and Joe are sitting and listening as Annabel sings Tomorrow.

                    ANNABEL
          The sun'll come up tomorrow, bet your
          bottom dollar that tomorrow, there'll be
          sun --

     Joe is on a loveseat with Matt.  Gillian lifts Matt up, sits
     down in his place next to Joe and plunks Matt into her lap.
     Nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat
     and can't see her without turning around.

     As she continues singing, Gillian moves her hand next to
     Joe's leg.  Joe edges away.  He looks around the room, sees
     Nanny Maureen standing behind the couch.  He stands, offers
     her his seat.  She sits.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     A much more informal Thanksgiving dinner. We see the
     leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in Kathleen's
     living room.

     Kathleen, Frank, Birdie, Christina, George and George's new
     girlfriend, Meredith and TWO OTHER FRIENDS are standing
     around the upright piano.  Birdie is playing a Christmas
     song, and everyone is singing.

     As the singing continues, over, we cut to:

     EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DECEMBER DAY

     As the Christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the
     window.

     Birdie walks by the store.  She stops to look at the
     customers inside, and then notices a sign in the window:

     "Book Signing January 10 - Best Selling Children's Author
     Laura Margulies."  There's a picture of Laura Margulies.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DECEMBER DUSK

     Kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with
     lovely decorations from a box.  Two people are carrying a
     tree home, there's the sound of church bells.

     Kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store,
     carrying Foxbooks shopping bags.

     Then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments, and as she
     starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the
     computer.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          This is such an odd Christmas.  I find
          myself missing my mother, who's been dead
          for ten years.  New York at Christmas is
          so loaded with all the things we used to
          do --

     INT. NEW YORK STATE THEATER - 1972 - DAY

     As Young Kathleen, dressed in a little velvet dress, sits in
     the audience next to her mother watching the ballet.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
          -- going to the Nutcracker --

     EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - 1972 - DAY

                    KATHLEEN (V.O. cont'd)
          -- ice skating at Rockefeller Center,
          where I was knocked into a 6-year-old
          maniac --

     A SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY knocks into her.

                    YOUNG KATHLEEN
          Hey, watch out --

                    SIX-YEAR-OLD BOY
          Me watch out, why don't you watch out?
          I'm not sliding around like a baby.  You
          think I come here to skate with babies?

     Young Kathleen's jaw drops and she stands there tongue-tied.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          My first experience as a speechless
          person.

     Her mother skates up and takes her hand.  The boy skates off.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I always miss my mother at Christmas, but
          somehow it's worse this year since I need
          some advice from her.

     And we hear the sound of another computer.

     INT. JOE'S DEN

     As he replies to Kathleen.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          My mother took me ice skating too --

     EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER SKATING RINK - DAY

     We see a little boy, YOUNG JOE, 8, skate past holding someone's
     hand --

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          -- although my mother did not skate.  The
          nanny skated --

     And we now see JOE'S NANNY, a young Sonja Henie, who suddenly
     peels off into a series of triple lutzes, as JOE'S MOTHER
     absently reads a copy of Vogue in the spectators' section.

     INT. LINCOLN CENTER THEATER - 1972 - DAY

                    JOE (V.O.)
          And I was in the Nutcracker.

     We see the stage now.  There's Young Joe, among the children
     at the Christmas party.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          So was my nanny.

     As JOE'S NANNY #2 pirouettes past.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          Different nanny.  By the way, I'm
          surprised you aren't a writer.  Although
          you probably are a writer and don't
          know it.  Are you a writer and I don't 
          know it?

     INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - 1972 - NIGHT

     Young Joe, at the dinner table with his father.  A wide shot
     of a big room with a huge table and servants.  Joe looks very
     small at the table as he eats his soup.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          My mother died when I was ten.  I was
          staying with my father, who is not famous
          for intimacy, and whose way of breaking
          the news of her death was to tell me she
          would not be coming to pick me up as
          usual.  It was a car accident, and I
          don't know where she was going or who she
          was with, and I assume what I owe her is
          my tendency to cover almost any emotion
          with a joke.  A useful gift, unless you
          want to know what you're feeling.  She
          was very beautiful.  People toss that
          word around a lot, but my mother was.

     The camera moves closer to the dining table.  We see that
     tears are rolling down little Joe's cheeks.

     INT. JOE'S DEN - NIGHT

     Joe stops typing.  He is surprised to find his eyes watering.
     A moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved
     himself to tears.  Shakes his head, shakes the emotion off.
     Starts typing again.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          Ancient history.  So what kind of advice
          do you need?  Can I help?

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kathleen in bed with her laptop reading Joe's letter.

     She starts to type a response.

     Suddenly there's harp arpeggio and an Instant Message
     flashes on screen.

     From NY 152

     CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - TOTAL SHOCK

     ON SCREEN AS WE SEE THE MESSAGE

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I had a gut feeling you would be on line
          now.

     INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Joe is in bed with his laptop.  And cut back and forth
     between them and their computer screens as they type Instant
     Messages to one another.  Possible split screens.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          I can give you advice.  I'm great at
          advice.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I don't think you can help.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Is it about love?

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          My business is in trouble.  My mother
          would have something wise to say.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I'm a brilliant businessman.  It's what
          I do best.  What's your business?

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          No specifics, remember?

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Minus specifics, it's hard to help.
          Except to say, go to the mattresses.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          What?

                    JOE (V.O.)
          It's from The Godfather.  It means you
          have to go to war.

     CLOSE ON KATHLEEN - LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER

                    KATHLEEN
               (to herself)
          The Godfather?

     She starts to type.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          What is it with men and The Godfather?

                    JOE (V.O.)
          The Godfather is the I Ching.  The
          Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.  The
          Godfather is the answer to any question.
          What should I pack for my summer
          vacation?  "Leave the gun, take the
          cannoli."  What day of the week is it?
          "Maunday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."
          And the answer to your question is "Go to
          the mattresses."
               (continued)

     CAMERA ON KATHLEEN - CONSIDERING WHAT HE SAYS

                    JOE (cont'd)
          You're at war.  "It's not personal, it's
          business.  It's not personal it's
          business."  Recite that to yourself every
          time you feel you're losing your nerve.
          I know you worry about being brave, this
          is your chance.  Fight.  Fight to the
          death.

     INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Patricia comes in as Joe is waiting for Kathleen's response.

                    PATRICIA
          Look what I bought.

     Joe types "Ciao" and signs off.  Looks up to see Patricia
     showing him a Plexiglas menorah.

                    PATRICIA
          I was just passing this store on Columbus
          Avenue and it caught my eye.

                    JOE
          What is it?

                    PATRICIA
          A Menorah.
                    JOE
          It doesn't look like a Menorah.

                    PATRICIA
          I know.  I don't know what came over me.
          I don't even celebrate Hanukkah.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     As Kathleen logs off, Frank comes in.

                    KATHLEEN
          Frank, I've decided to go to the
          mattresses.  Do you think it would be a
          gigantic conflict of interest if you
          wrote something about us?

     INT. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     It's January.  The store is more crowded than we've seen it.
     Frank is there with several copies of the Independent.  The
     phone is ringing off the hook.  Christina and George are
     fielding calls.  Birdie is reading Frank's article.

                    BIRDIE
               (reading)
          "Kathleen Kelly and her mother Cecilia
          Kelly have raised your children.  If this
          precious resource is killed by the cold
          cash cow of Foxbooks, it will not only be
          the end of Western civilization as we
          know it, but the end of something even
          dearer: our neighborhood as we know it.
          Save the Shop Around the Corner and you
          will save your own soul."  Frank, that's
          charming.

                    FRANK
          You think it's a little over the top?

                    BIRDIE
          Just say thank you.

                    FRANK
          Thank you.

                    CHRISTINA
               (calling to Kathleen)
          Channel 2's outside.

     INT. BACK ROOM - THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - SAME TIME

     Kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror.  She takes a deep
     breath.

                    KATHLEEN
          In a second.

                    GEORGE
               (from the other room)
          The Village Voice is coming.

                    KATHLEEN
          Omigod.

     Frank sticks his head in.

                    FRANK
               (in shock)
          It's him.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who?

                    FRANK
          God. It is God.

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS

     Kathleen comes out of the storage room.

     William Spungeon is standing there.

                    WILLIAM SPUNGEON
          I'm William Spungeon.

                    KATHLEEN
          I'm very pleased to meet you.  I'm
          Kathleen Kelly.

     Frank is practically levitating.

                    SPUNGEON
          I knew your mother.  Although she knew me
          only as W.  That enormous bookstore is
          obscene.

                    FRANK
          I'm Frank Navasky.  I carry your picture
          in my wallet.

     He pulls it out.  Spungeon looks at him like he's crazy.

                    KATHLEEN
          We've organized pickets.  Channel 13 is
          doing a special.

                    SPUNGEON
          I'd be glad to talk to the press if it's
          all right with you.  They've been trying
          to interview me for years.

                    FRANK
          The press?  I'm the press.

                    KATHLEEN
          You'd allow that?  For me?  For the
          store?  That's incredible.  Although you
          wouldn't have to be photographed.  I
          respect that.  If it's television, they
          could just put one of those blurry dots
          in front of your face.

                    SPUNGEON
          No television.

                    CHRISTINA
               (referring to the TV crew)
          They're waiting for you --

                    FRANK
          I know all your books.  Phaelox the
          gnome, the little man who comes from
          nowhere... and is going nowhere...
               (quoting)
          "Where did you come from?"  "Nowhere."
          "Where are you going?"  "Nowhere."

                    SPUNGEON
          Cool it.  I'm starting to break out in
          hives.
               (to Kathleen)
          Here's my phone number.

                    KATHLEEN
          I had no idea William Spugeon had a
          phone.

                    SPUNGEON
          Adios.

     He gives a little wave and leaves.

                    FRANK
          This is historic.
               (beat)
          Do you realize what I've done?  By
          writing that piece, do you realize?
          I've brought William Spungeon in from
          the cold. Holy shit.  I am completely
          amazing.

     At that moment a TV REPORTER sticks her head into the store.

                    TV REPORTER
          Kathleen Kelly?

     Kathleen takes a deep breath, walks out the door.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

                    CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
          Are you ready, Miss Kelly?

                    KATHLEEN
          Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.

                    CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
          What?

                    KATHLEEN
          Never mind.  I'm ready.  Shoot.

     INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - THAT NIGHT

                    CHANNEL 2 TV REPORTER
          We're here in front of the Shop Around
          the Corner, the famous West Side
          children's bookstore now on the verge of
          having to close its doors because the big
          bad wolf, Foxbooks, has opened only a few
          hundred feet away, wooing customers with
          its sharp discounts and designer coffee.

                    KATHLEEN
          They have to have discounts and lattes,
          because most of the people who work there
          have never read a book.

     And pull back now to reveal that we're in:

     INT. GYM - NIGHT

     Five TV sets are on, over adjoining treadmills, Joe and
     Kevin are on two of the treadmills, walking and watching.

                    JOE
          She's not as nice as she seems on
          television.

                    KEVIN
          You've met her?

                    JOE
          She's kind of a pill.

                    KEVIN
          She's probably not as attractive as she
          seems on television either.

                    JOE
          No, she's beautiful.  But a pill.

                    KEVIN
          So you don't feel bad about basically
          destroying her livelihood not to mention
          her legacy not to mention her raison
          d'etre.

                    JOE
          It's not personal --

                    KEVIN
          It's business.

                    JOE
          Right.  Exactly.

     They look up at the television.

     INT. TELEVISION SCREEN - CONTINUOUS

     Joe onscreen, with a super: Joe Fox, Vice-President Foxbooks.

                    JOE
          I sell cheap books.  Sue me.  I sell
          cheap books, and as a result -- listen 
          to this, because it's really bad --
          more people can buy books.

     The show immediately cuts back to the newscaster.

     On Joe and Kevin.

                    KEVIN
          That's what you said?

                    JOE
               (outraged)
          That's not all I said.  I said -- I can't
          believe those bastards -- I said we were
          great, I said people can come and sit and
          read for hours and no one bothers them, I
          said we stock 150,000 titles, I showed
          them the New York City section.  I said
          we were a goddamn piazza where people
          could mingle and mix and be.

                    KEVIN
          A piazza?

                    JOE
          I was eloquent.  Shit.  It's just
          inevitable, isn't it?  People are going
          to want to turn her into Joan of Arc --

                    KEVIN
          -- and you into Attila the Hun.

                    JOE
          Well it's not me personally, it's more
          like it's the company --

                    KATHLEEN
               (on the television)
          And I have to say, I have met Joe Fox,
          who owns Foxbooks, and I have heard him
          compared his store to a Price Club and the
          books in it to cans of olive oil.

     On Joe, reacting.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

     A small rally is taking place, with picket signs.  Kathleen
     is standing on a small speaker's platform, along with the
     Borough President.

                    KATHLEEN
          My mother used to say to me that every
          book you sell is a gift from the
          heart...

     EXT. FOXBOOKS - DAY

     As 20 CHILDREN march in front of the store, holding little
     makeshift picket signs and singing songs.  "One, two, three,
     four, we don't want this Superstore."

     Customers go right through the line and into the store.

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     We can hear the pickets marching and singing outside --
     although the store is full of customers anyway.  The Fox men
     -- Joe, Nelson and Schuyler -- are sitting in the cafe.
     Nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper, which has the
     old high-school yearbook picture of William Spungeon on the
     front page and a headline: William Spungeon Emerges from
     Hiding to Support Bookstore.

                    SCHUYLER
          Who is this Spungeon anyway?

                    JOE
          He's a writer.

                    NELSON
          Well, I've never heard of him.  And
          neither has anyone else in this place.

     INT. TV SET - NIGHT

     As we see SIDNEY-ANN STRONGIN, a young and attractive PBS
     talk show hostess for a show called Inside Media.

                    SIDNEY-ANN
          The New York Literary world was shocked
          this week when William Spungeon, the most
          famously reclusive author since J.D.
          Salinger, announced that he was coming
          out of hiding because of his loyalty to a
          small children's bookstore on the West
          Side of Manhattan.  Discussing this
          tonight is a man I happen to think of as
          one of this city's most underappreciated
          assets, Frank Navasky.

                    FRANK
          Thank you.

                    SIDNEY-ANN
          This all happened because of you, didn't
          it --

                    FRANK
          Well, I knew William Spungeon loved
          children's books so I wrote a provocative
          column --

                    SIDNEY-ANN
          Your specialty.

     Frank laughs.  Sidney-Ann laughs.

                    FRANK
          And it kind of smoked him out.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     As she and Frank watch the television show.

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          Technologically speaking, the world's 
          out of hand.  Take the VCR.  The whole
          idea of a VCR is that it makes it possible
          for you to tape what's on television
          while you're out of the house.  But the
          whole point of being out of the house is
          so you can miss what's on television.
          Radio.  Now there's a medium I can get
          behind.

                    SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
          Well, we're on television... and you're
          good at it.

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          Thank you.

     Another little moment between them.

                    SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
          The bookstore.  Tell us about it.

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          Are you planning to collect radios?

                    SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
          Do you think I should?

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          The Shop Around the Corner is a true New
          York treasure.

                    SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
          As are you.  I'd love to have you back.

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          Any time.  Are we done?

                    SIDNEY-ANN ON TELEVISION
          Not at all.

                    FRANK ON TELEVISION
          Because I just want to say that the only
          show I do watch is yours.

                    KATHLEEN
               (appalled)
          Omigod.

                    FRANK
          Hey, I was just being polite.  Okay, I
          admit, I slobbered all over her.

     The show continues.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

     As we see Kathleen flip the open sign to closed.

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

     George is talking to Kathleen and Birdie, who is toting up
     the week's receipts.

                    GEORGE
          And I can't decide whether to put
          sausages into the meat sauce or just
          chopped meat.  Last time I made it,
          Detective Carter and I never even sat
          down to dinner because --
               (he makes some sort of hand
                gesture indicating that sex
                prevented them from dining)
          and last night, I made margaritas in the
          blender, and I took the ice cube and --

                    BIRDIE
          Spare us.

     George goes out the door.

     Birdie looks at Kathleen.

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't tell me.  Not the slightest
          difference?

     Birdie can't bring herself to answer.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          How could that be?  All this publicity
          and not one bit of difference?
          Oh Birdie, what am I going to do?  What
          would Mom have done?

                    BIRDIE
          Let's ask her.

     She opens the locket hanging around her neck.  There's a
     picture of Kathleen's mother inside it.  Birdie holds the
     locket up to her face.

                    BIRDIE
          Cecilia, what should we do?

     Birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens.  A pause.

                    KATHLEEN
          Birdie?

                    BIRDIE
          Shhhh.
               (after a beat, shrugs)
          She has no idea, but she thinks the
          window display is lovely.  Good night
          dearie.

     Birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag, goes out the
     door.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

     It's starting to rain.  Kathleen lowers the grate over the
     store.  As she turns to walk away, William Spungeon steps in
     her path out of the shadows.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh my goodness, hello.  What are you
          doing here.

                    SPUNGEON
          Loitering.  Lurking.  Skulking.
          Stalking.

     He laughs.  So does she.  Dramatically, he whips out an
     umbrella and opens it over the two of them.

                    SPUNGEON (cont'd)
          You look very beautiful.

                    KATHLEEN
          Thank you.  But I'm a wreck.

     He touches her cheek suddenly.  Kathleen starts.  Then he
     blows on his hand.

                    SPUNGEON
          An eyelash.  It's gone.

     Kathleen relaxes.  They start walking.

                    KATHLEEN
          Are you writing another book?

                    SPUNGEON
          I'm in the home stretch.  I'll be done in
          approximately six more years.

                    KATHLEEN
          Should I discount?

                    SPUNGEON
          It's about a man on a quest for knowledge
          who meets a woman he cannot resist.

                    KATHLEEN
          If I discount I have to fire someone
          because I can't discount with this
          overhead but whom could I fire?  I
          couldn't fire anyone.

     Spungeon suddenly puts his hand through Kathleen's hair.  She
     stops, frozen in place.

                    SPUNGEON
          You have your mother's hair.  Thick,
          wild, the color of Nebraska wheat.

     He grabs her and tries to kiss her.

                    KATHLEEN
          What are you doing?  Let me go.

     He backs her into a wall.

                    KATHLEEN
          Stop it.  Are you crazy?

     She kicks him in the shins, wiggles free and runs away.

                    SPUNGEON
               (calling after her)

     INT. NUT SHOP OF BROADWAY - DAY

     George, Kathleen and Christina in the shop.  Kathleen is
     buying more lollipops.

                    KATHLEEN
          We're meeting in a public place.

                    CHRISTINA
          Well don't go anywhere with him.  Don't
          even go out to the street with him
          afterwards.  Get a dial cab to just sit
          there and wait for you.

                    GEORGE
          Did you tell Frank?

                    KATHLEEN
          There's nothing to tell.

                    CHRISTINA
          But did you tell him?

                    KATHLEEN
          He's away.  At the 32nd anniversary of
          the Chicago Seven trial.

                    GEORGE
          And he's gone to a place where there are
          no phones.  Do you even know this guy's
          name?

     Kathleen shakes her head no.

                    CHRISTINA
          And you're going to meet him in a bar?

                    KATHLEEN
          Not a bar.  That place on 83rd with the
          cheesecake.

                    GEORGE
          And he will wear a flower in his lapel,
          and you will be carrying a copy of Anna
          Karenina with a rose in it.

     No answer.

                    CHRISTINA
          Oh God, no.

                    KATHLEEN
          Not Anna Karenina.  Pride and Prejudice.

     EXT. FOXBOOKS - NIGHT

     As Joe and Kevin walk out of the store and start downtown.

                    KEVIN
          I suppose she's carrying a copy of a book
          with a flower in it.

     Joe doesn't say anything.

                    KEVIN
          Not really.

                    JOE
          Really.

                    KEVIN
          Which Jane Austen is it?

                    JOE
          Pride and Prejudice.

                    KEVIN
          She could be a real dog.

                    JOE
          I know.  Look, I'll just stay ten
          minutes.  I'll say hello.  Drink a cup of
          coffee and split.  I'm outta here.

     He looks at Kevin.

                    JOE
          What if she has a really high, squeaky
          voice?  I hate that.  It reminds me of
          those mice in Cinderella.

                    KEVIN
          What mice in Cinderella?

                    JOE
          Gus-gus and oh shit, I can't remember the
          other one.  Why am I compelled to meet
          her?  I'm just ruining a good thing.

                    KEVIN
          You're taking it to the next level.  I
          always do that.  I always take a
          relationship to the next level, and if it
          works okay I take it to the next level
          after that, until I can finally get to
          the level where it becomes absolutely
          necessary for me to leave.

                    JOE
          I'm not going to stay long anyway.  I
          already said that, didn't I.  Christ.
          I'm a total wreck.

     As they reach:

     EXT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

     Joe stops and looks at Kevin.

                    JOE
          Kevin, this woman is the most adorable
          creature I have ever come in contact
          with.  If she turns out to be even as
          good-looking as a mailbox, I will be
          crazy not to turn my life upside down
          and marry her.

                    KEVIN
          She could be a real dog.

                    JOE
               (a total panic)
          You go look.

                    KEVIN
          Me?

                    JOE
          Just go to the window and check her out.

                    KEVIN
          You're pathetic.

     Kevin goes to the window and looks inside.

     EXT. CAFE LALO - NIGHT

     Joe and Kevin in front.

     Kevin looks in the window.

                    JOE
          See her?

                    KEVIN
          There's a beautiful, whoa, a very
          beautiful girl.

                    JOE
          Yes.

                    KEVIN
          But no book.  Let me see, let me see...
          Wait a minute.  There's a book with a
          flower, so it must be her.

                    JOE
          What does he look like?

                    KEVIN
          There's a waiter blocking, I can't see
          her face.  He's serving her a cup of tea
          and she's putting in three spoonfuls of
          sugar --

                    JOE
          Well, why shouldn't she?

                    KEVIN
          No reason.  Unless she has hypoglycemia.
          Oh, he's moving.

                    JOE
          Can you see her?

                    KEVIN
          Yes.

                    JOE
          And? --

                    KEVIN
               (clearly frustrated)
          She's very pretty.

                    JOE
          She is.  I knew she would be.  She had
          to be.

                    KEVIN
          She looks... I would say she has a little
          of the coloring of that Kathleen Kelly
          person.

                    JOE
          Kathleen Kelly of the bookstore.

                    KEVIN
          Why not?  You said you thought she was
          attractive.

                    JOE
          So what?  Who cares about Kathleen Kelly?

                    KEVIN
          Well, if you don't like Kathleen Kelly,
          I can tell you right now you ain't gonna
          like this girl.

                    JOE
          Why not?

                    KEVIN
          Because it is Kathleen Kelly.

     Joe elbows Kevin aside and looks.

                    JOE
          Oh, God.

     A long beat.

                    KEVIN
          What are you going to do?

                    JOE
          Nothing.

                    KEVIN
          You're going to let her just wait there?

                    JOE
          Yes.  Yes I am.  That's exactly what I'm
          going to do.  Why not?

                    KEVIN
          But she wrote the letters.

                    JOE
          Good night, Kevin.  I'll see you
          tomorrow.

     He walks away, leaving Kevin.

     Kevin stares after him.  Then he walks away in the other
     direction.

     INT. CAFE LALO - CONTINUOUS

     Kathleen, sitting alone, at a table for two, is drinking her
     tea.  She's starting to feel a little foolish.  She checks
     her watch.

     A loud, boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next
     to hers.  They're laughing.  A man from the group grabs the
     empty chair at Kathleen's table.

                    MAN
          Do you mind?

     Kathleen jumps up.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, yes.  I'm expecting someone.
          Please.

     She takes the chair back.  Sits down again.  She watches the
     group as they playfully fight over the menus.

     She checks her watch again.  Then she opens her copy of Pride
     and Prejudice and looks at it.  She can't focus.

     A man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at
     him.  But he's going to meet another group of people.

     As he passes her table, he knocks the book and the flower
     onto the floor.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh!

     She jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were
     precious china.

     In the window, now, behind her, Joe appears.  He watches, as
     she rearranges the book and the flower.

     He disappears from sight.

     A beat...

     He walks in the door.

                    JOE
          Kathleen Kelly.  Hello.  What a
          coincidence.  Mind if I sit down?

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes I do.  I'm expecting someone.

     Joe picks up her book, looks at it.

                    JOE
          Pride and Prejudice.

     Kathleen grabs it back.

                    KATHLEEN
          Do you mind?

     She places it back on the table, puts the rose into it.

                    JOE
          I didn't know you were a Jane Austen
          fan.  Not that it's a surprise.  I bet
          you read it every year.  I bet you just
          love Mr. Darcy, and that your sentimental
          heart beats wildly at the thought that he
          and whatever her name is are really,
          honestly and truly going to end up
          together.

                    KATHLEEN
          Would you please leave?

     Joe sits down.

                    KATHLEEN
          Please?

                    JOE
          I'll get up as soon as your friend comes.
          Is he late?

                    KATHLEEN
          The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is
          Elizabeth Bennet and she's one of the
          greatest, most complex characters ever
          written, not that you would know.

                    JOE
          As a matter of fact I've read it.

                    KATHLEEN
          Well, good for you.

                    JOE
          I think you'd discover a lot of things if
          you really knew me.

                    KATHLEEN
          If I really knew you, I know what I would
          find -- instead of a brain, a cash
          register, instead of a heart, a bottom
          line.

     Kathleen is shocked at herself.

                    JOE
          What is it?

                    KATHLEEN
          I just had a breakthrough, and I have to
          thank you for it.  For the first time in
          my life, when confronted with a horrible,
          insensitive person I actually knew what I
          wanted to say and I said it.

                    JOE
          I think you have a gift for it.  It was a
          splendid mixture of poetry and meanness.


                    KATHLEEN
          Meanness?  Let me tell you --

                    JOE
          Don't misunderstand me, I'm just paying
          you a compliment.

     He lifts the book off the table.  Kathleen grabs for it.

                    KATHLEEN
          Why are you doing this?

     She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.

                    JOE
          What have we have?  A red, no, crimson
          rose, tucked into the pages.  Something
          you read about in a book, no doubt.  One
          of those books with a lady in a nightgown
          on the cover about to throw herself off a
          cliff.

     She holds her hand out for it.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          Give it to me.

     Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.

                    JOE
          It's a joke to you, isn't it?
          Everything's a joke to you.

     She grabs the rose.  Puts it back in the book.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          Please leave.  I beg you.

     He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
     next table, with his back to her.

     The door to the restaurant opens.  Kathleen looks at it
     hopefully.  A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
     by a pleasant looking woman.

     For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
     wind has just gone out of her sails.  She takes out her
     compact, looks into her mirror.  She slides it over to look
     behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.  He
     turns away suddenly.

     Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.

                    JOE
          You know what the handkerchief reminds
          me of?  The first day I met you --

                    KATHLEEN
          The first day you lied to me --

                    JOE
          I didn't lie to you --

                    KATHLEEN
          You did too --

                    JOE
          I did not --

                    KATHLEEN
          I thought all that Fox stuff was so
          charming.  F-O-X.

                    JOE
          I never lied about it --

                    KATHLEEN
          "Joe.  Just call me Joe."  As if you were
          one of those stupid 22-year-old girls
          with no last name.  "Hi, I'm Kimberley."
          "Hi, I'm Janice."  What's wrong with
          them?  Don't they know you're supposed to
          have last names?  It's like they're a
          whole generation of cocktail waitresses.

     She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go off
     on.  But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
     table.

                    JOE
          I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --

                    KATHLEEN
          That's not what I meant --

                    JOE
          And when I said the thing about the Price
          Club and cans of olive oil, that wasn't
          what I meant either --

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.  I
          feel so sorry for you.

     The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
     in a boa comes in the door.

                    JOE
          I am going to take a wild guess that this
          isn't him, either.  Who is he, I wonder.
          Not, I gather, the world's greatest
          living expert on Julius and Ethel
          Rosenberg, but someone else entirely.
          Will you be you be mean to him too?  Will
          you start out sweet as sugar candy and
          then suddenly, miraculously, like a bolt
          from the blue, find that sharp little 
          tongue of yours?

                    KATHLEEN
          No, I won't.  Because the man who's
          coming here tonight is completely unlike
          you.  The man who is coming here is kind
          and funny -- he has the most wonderful
          sense of humor --

                    JOE
          But he's not here.

                    KATHLEEN
          If he's not here, he has a reason,
          because there is not a cruel or careless
          bone in his body.  I can't expect you to
          know anything about a person like that.
          You've nothing but a suit.

     A beat.  Joe gets up.

                    JOE
          That is my cue.  Good night.

     Joe leaves.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER THAT NIGHT

     Kathleen comes down the street.  She drops the rose in the
     trash can.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - A MINUTE LATER

     Kathleen comes in, drops the book on the table, takes off her
     coat and goes immediately to the computer.  She clicks on
     American Online.  Waits impatiently to connect.  Looks with
     anticipation at the mail box.

     THE COMPUTER SCREEN - NO MAIL

     Hold on Kathleen as a tear starts down her face.

     She takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her
     face and blows her nose.  Then looks at her handkerchief and
     tosses it over her shoulder.

     She goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of
     her shoes.

     Then she lies down on the bed, fully clothed.  She reaches
     up to turn out the light.

     INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As Joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket.
     The computer is on the desk, and the light on it illuminates
     the room.

     Patricia is in the next room, eating matzos.

                    PATRICIA (O.C.)
          So I said to her, "If you think I will
          even talk to you about paying that kind
          of advance for an author whose last book
          is being used as trivets all over the
          world, you are completely crazy."

     On Joe's face, barely bearing.

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     As Kevin and Joe walk through the store.

                    KEVIN
          But underneath that disagreeable exterior
          she could turn out to be --

                    JOE
          A real bitch.  Let's not talk about it.
          I'm going back to the office.  You must
          have work to do.

                    KEVIN
          Not really.  This place is humming like a
          top.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     As Kathleen comes around the corner.  Christina is waiting.

                    CHRISTINA
          What happened?

                    KATHLEEN
          He never came.

                    CHRISTINA
          He stood you up?

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER

     As Kathleen puts her purse into the drawer.

                    KATHLEEN
          I think something happened, something
          terrible and unexpected that made it
          impossible for him --

     George walks in.

                    GEORGE
          What happened?

                    KATHLEEN
          He wasn't able to make it.

                    GEORGE
          He stood you up.

                    KATHLEEN
          What could have happened?
               (continued)

     George looks suddenly stricken.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          Why didn't he come?  Maybe he showed up,
          took one look at me and left.

                    CHRISTINA
          Not possible.

                    KATHLEEN
          Maybe there was a subway accident.

                    CHRISTINA
          Absolutely.

                    KATHLEEN
          A train was trapped underground with him
          inside.

                    CHRISTINA
          And no phone.

     George continues to look stricken.  He's starting to shake
     his head.

                    KATHLEEN
          Or an automobile accident.  Those cab
          drivers are maniacs.

                    CHRISTINA
          They hit something and you slam right
          into that plastic partition.

                    KATHLEEN
          His elbows could be in splints -- so he
          can't really dial --

                    CHRISTINA
          Or he could be in the hospital in one of
          those semi-private room with like --
                    
                    CHRISTINA & KATHLEEN
               (together)
          -- no phone.

     They look at George.  Still shaking his head.

                    KATHLEEN
               (to George)
          What?

     George hands them a New York Post.  They look at the cover:
     COPS NAB ROOFTOP KILLER

                    KATHLEEN
          What are you saying?

                    GEORGE
          It could be.

     Dead silence.

                    GEORGE (cont'd)
          He was arrested two blocks from the
          cheesecake place.

                    CHRISTINA
          Is there a picture?

     There it is.  It's of a man with his jacket pulled over his
     head.

     They all look at it.

                    CHRISTINA
          So that explains it.

                    GEORGE
          He was in jail.

                    CHRISTINA
          And there was a phone --

                    GEORGE
          -- but he got only one call and he had to
          use it to call his lawyer.

                    CHRISTINA
          You are so lucky.

                    GEORGE
          You could be dead.

                    KATHLEEN
          Are you crazy?  This man couldn't
          possibly be the rooftop killer.

                    CHRISTINA
          Remember when you thought Frank might be
          the Unabomber?

                    KATHLEEN
          That was different.

                    CHRISTINA
          How long did you sit there all alone?

                    KATHLEEN
          Not that long.  Joe Fox came in --

                    CHRISTINA
          Joe Fox!

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't want to talk about it.
               (closes her eyes)
          Let's get to work.

     They look around.  There's no one in the store and nothing to
     do.

     A pause.

                    KATHLEEN
          There must be something to do.  There's
          always something to do.

     They hear the jingle of the front door.  They look hopefully
     toward it.  It's only Birdie.

                    CHRISTINA
          He stood her up.

     Hold on Kathleen as the computer sound begins.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I have been thinking about you.  Last
          night I went to meet you and you weren't
          there.  I wish I knew why.  I felt so
          foolish.
               (continued)

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     As she types.  And we cut from her face to the screen as we
     hear a voice-over:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          And as I waited, someone else showed up,
          a man who has made my professional life a
          misery, and an amazing thing happened --
          I was able, for the first time in my
          life, to say the exact thing I wanted to say
          it.  And of course, afterwards, I felt
          terrible.  Just as you said I would.

     INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

     The E-mail from Kathleen continues as Joe reads.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I was cruel, and I'm never cruel.  And
          even though I can hardly believe what I
          said mattered to this man -- to him, I'm
          just a bug to be crushed -- but what if
          it did?  No matter what he's done to me,
          there's no excuse for my behavior.
          Anyway, you are my dear friend, and I so
          wanted to talk to you.  I hope you have a
          good reason for not being there last
          night, but if you don't, and if we never
          really connect again, I just want to tell
          you how much it has meant to me to know
          you were there.

     Joe sits there a second.  A moment of intense ambivalence.
     Then he hits the Menu key and signs off.

                    COMPUTER
          Goodbye.

     Joe stands and leaves the room.

     The computer sits there.

     Hold on the computer.  We hear him open the refrigerator 
     door. We hear him close the refrigerator door.  He passes
     the den without even looking into it.  A moment later he
     comes back into the room, stares at the computer.  He starts
     for the bedroom, changes his mind.  Circles the computer.
     He's going to go cold turkey if it kills him.

     Fuck it.  He sits down.  Sign on.  Starts to type.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I am in Vancouver.

     He stops... Hits the delete button and erases the message.
     He starts typing again:

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I was stuck in a meeting, which I
          couldn't get out of it, and there was
          no phone.

     He backspaces to erase "there was no phone."

     Screen now reads: I was stuck in a meeting, which I couldn't
     get out of it.  Joe sits there thinking for a moment.  Then he
     starts typing.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          The electricity went out in the building
          and we were trapped on the 18th floor and
          the telephone system blew too.

     He stops and looks at it.  Then he types:

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          Amazingly enough.

     He sits looking at it.

     Then he deletes the whole thing.

     Sits looking at the blank screen.

                    JOE
          Fuck you.

     He clicks the Yes box.

     Then he starts to type again.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Dear friend: I cannot tell you what
          happened to me last night, but I beg you
          from the bottom of my heart to forgive me
          for not being there.

     He deletes "for not being there."

     Then types again, after "to forgive me".

                    JOE (V.O.)
          -- for what happened.  I feel terrible
          that you found yourself in a situation
          that caused you additional pain.  But I'm
          absolutely sure that whatever you said
          last night was provoked, even deserved.
          And everyone says things they regret when
          they're worried or stressed.  You were
          expecting to see someone you trusted and
          met the enemy instead.  The fault is
          mine.
               (continued)

     EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

     As Kathleen and Christina walk down the street together.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          Someday I'll explain everything.
          Meanwhile, I'm still here.  Talk to me.

                    CHRISTINA
          Did he say anything about meeting again?

                    KATHLEEN
          Not really.  It doesn't matter.  We'll
          just be like George Bernard Shaw and Mrs.
          Patrick Campbell and write letters our
          whole lives --

     They go into an apartment building.

     INT. BIRDIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     A large rent-controlled West Side apartment.  Birdie is 
     pouring tea.  There's a plate of cookies.

     Christina is looking at the picture of Birdie as a young
     woman, dressed in a sort of Carmen Miranda getup.

                    CHRISTINA
          Where was this taken, Birdie?

                    BIRDIE
          Seville.

                    KATHLEEN
          When you had the thunderbolt?

                    BIRDIE
          Yes.  What did you decide, dearie?

                    KATHLEEN
          Close.  We're going to close.

                    CHRISTINA
          Close.

                    KATHLEEN
          Although it feels like such a failure.
          It feels like I'm quitting.  It feels
          like... Mom...

     She closes her eyes.

     Birdie sits down on the loveseat next to Kathleen, puts her
     arms around her.  Hold on them.

                    BIRDIE
          Keeping the store open doesn't keep your
          mother alive, although sometimes I think
          we all think it does.

     Christina looks over at the picture of Birdie.

                    CHRISTINA
          Who was it, Birdie?  That you had the
          thunderbolt over?

     Birdie shakes her head.  She's not going to tell them.

                    CHRISTINA (cont'd)
          It's so romantic.

                    BIRDIE
          But it wasn't meant to be.

                    CHRISTINA
          Why not?

                    BIRDIE
          He ran Spain.

                    CHRISTINA
          Spain?

                    BIRDIE
          The country.  He ran it.  That was his
          job.  And then he died.  Just as well.

     INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE - NIGHT

     As Frank and Kathleen go up the escalator, on their way to a 
     movie.

                    FRANK
          She fell in love with Generalissimo
          Franco?

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't say that.  We don't know that for
          sure.

                    FRANK
          Who else could it have been?  It was
          probably around 1960 --

                    KATHLEEN
          I mean, it's not like he was something
          normal, like a socialist or an anarchist
          or something --

                    FRANK
          It happened in Spain.  People do really
          stupid things in foreign countries.

                    KATHLEEN
          Absolutely.  They buy leather jackets,
          they go see Flamenco, they ride in
          gondolas, they eat in restaurants where
          guitarists sing Malaguena sola Rosa, but
          they don't fall in love with fascist
          dictators.

     They enters one of the theatres.

     INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS

     As they find seats and sit down.  A trailer is playing.

                    KATHLEEN
          Birdie is a very kind person, she's
          practically my surrogate mother.

                    FRANK
          Well she's out of her mind.

                    KATHLEEN
          She is not.

                    FRANK
          I could never ever be with anyone who
          doesn't take politics as seriously as I
          do.

     The person in front of them turns around.

                    PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
          Do you mind?

                    FRANK
          A hot dog is singing.  You need quiet
          while a hot dog is singing?

     The two of them sit there.

                    KATHLEEN
          I have something to tell you.  I didn't
          vote.

                    FRANK
          What?

                    KATHLEEN
          In the last mayoral election, when Rudy
          Giuliani was running against Ruth
          Messinger, I went to get a manicure and
          forgot to vote.

                    FRANK
          Since when do you get manicures?

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, I suppose you could never be with a
          woman who gets manicures.

                    FRANK
          Forget it.  It's okay.  I forgive you.

                    PERSON IN FRONT OF THEM
          Shhhhhh.

                    KATHLEEN
          You forgive me.

     Hold on them a beat.

     Kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre.

     INT. SONY LINCOLN SQUARE THEATRE ESCALATOR - NIGHT

     Kathleen on the down escalator.  Frank scrambling to catch up
     with her.

                    FRANK
          What's going on?

     Kathleen's upset.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
          Hey.  What is it?

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

     As they walk uptown.

                    FRANK
          Look, this has been a big week, you're
          closing the store --

                    KATHLEEN
          It's not that, Frank, really it's not.
          It's just... Frank...

                    FRANK
          I know, that was terrible of me.

                    KATHLEEN
          What was?

                    FRANK
          To jump all over you when I'm the one
          who's really...  Oh, God, I don't know
          how to say this --

                    KATHLEEN
          What is it?

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

     As we see Kathleen and Frank being served drinks in a glassed-
     in extension of a restaurant.

     INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     As Kathleen looks at Frank, waiting for him to begin.

                    FRANK
          You're a wonderful person, Kathleen.

                    KATHLEEN
          So are you.

                    FRANK
          And I'm honored that you want to be with
          me because you would never be with anyone
          who wasn't truly worthy --

                    KATHLEEN
          I feel exactly the same way about you.

                    FRANK
          Oh, God, don't say that, please, that
          just makes it worse.

                    KATHLEEN
          What?
               (he shakes his head)
          You don't love me?

     Frank shakes his head no.

                    KATHLEEN
          Me either.

                    FRANK
          You don't love me?

     Kathleen shakes her head no.

                    FRANK
          But we're so right for each other.

                    KATHLEEN
          I know.

     A long beat.

                    KATHLEEN
          That woman on television, right?
          Sidney-Ann.

     Frank nods.

                    FRANK
          I mean, nothing's happened or anything.

                    KATHLEEN
          I think she's a Republican.

                    FRANK
          I can't help myself.

     Kathleen pats him.

                    FRANK (cont'd)
          What about you?  Is there someone else?

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, somewhere out there, I'm sure.
          Somewhere --
               (she throws up her hands)
          In cyberspace.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     As Frank, carrying a typewriter, walks out off Kathleen's
     building and puts it into the back of a taxicab.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

     As a sign goes up in the window: "Closing This Week: All
     Stock 40% off."

     INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - LATE THAT DAY

     The store is crowded.  People are buying stacks of books.
     We hear brief snatches of conversation: Birdie telling a
     customer she's planning to travel, Christina saying she's
     finally going to have to finish her dissertation, George
     saying he's been offered a job at Foxbooks but even though
     it's okay with Kathleen, he wouldn't work there if it were
     the last place on the earth.

     There is a frantic, rummage sale atmosphere.

     Kathleen, busy at the cash register, looks up for a minute at
     her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures.  We hear the
     sound of the computer and hear her voice-over:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          My store is closing this week.
          I own a store.  Did I ever tell you that?
          Probably not.  It's a lovely store --

     As a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table.

                    WOMAN SHOPPER
          This is a tragedy.
               (yelling across the shop to her
                husband)
          Honey, grab a copy of The Trumpet of the
          Swan.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
          -- and in a week, it will be something
          really depressing, like a Baby Gap.  I
          am being amazingly brave --

                    WOMAN SHOPPER
          What are you going to do with yourself?

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't know.  I'm going to take some
          time.  I have a little money saved.  I'm
          almost looking forward to it --

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
          I am so cheerful I would make Pollyanna
          throw up.

                    SECOND SHOPPER
          I came here every Saturday when I was a
          little girl.  I remember when your mother
          gave me Anne of Green Gables.  "Read it
          with a box of Kleenex," that's what she
          told me.

                    THIRD SHOPPER
          She's looking down on you right now.

                    KATHLEEN
          I'm sure she is.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
          I have promised myself I'm not going
          to cry.

     A FORTH SHOPPER approaches the counter with a stack of books
     up to his chin, and manages to slide the stack on the 
     counter.

                    FOURTH SHOPPER
          We should bomb Foxbooks.

                    KATHLEEN
          It's not their fault.  The truth is, the
          world is just... different.

     She starts ringing up the sale.

     EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

     As Kathleen walks home.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.,cont'd)
          Soon we'll just be a memory.  In fact,
          someone, some foolish person will
          probably think it's a tribute to this
          city, the way it keeps changing on you,
          the way you can never count on it, or
          something.  I know, because that's the
          sort of thing I'm always saying.  But the
          truth is, I'm heartbroken.  I feel as if
          part of me has died,  and my mother has
          died all over again, and no one can ever
          make it right.

     She stops in front of the window, watching the customers
     lined up to buy books.

     EXT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

     As Kathleen enters and looks around.

     She goes up the stairs.

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT

     As Kathleen walks into it.

     It's huge, of course.  With its reading area, and stage, and
     room for displays, and child-size furniture, and so many
     books and so many customers.

     Kathleen sits down on a little child-size chair, completely
     wilted.

     KATHLEEN FROM ANOTHER P.O.V.

     And now we see Joe watching her, from a distance.  She doesn't
     see him.

     A woman browsing, stops a sales person.

                    WOMAN SHOPPER
          Do you have the "Shoe" books?

                    SALESPERSON
          The "Shoe" books?  Who's the author?

                    WOMAN SHOPPER
          I don't know.  My friend told me my
          daughter has to read the "Shoe" books, 
          so here I am.

          Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes and
          Theater Shoes and Movie Shoes...
               (she starts crying as she tells
                her)
          I'd start with Skating Shoes, it's my
          favorite, although Ballet Shoes is
          completely wonderful.

                    SALESPERSON

                    WOMAN SHOPPER
          Thank you.

     As she walks away.

          They know nothing, they know absolutely
          nothing.

     ON JOE

     as he watches her.  We hear the sound of the computer.

     She starts out of the store.  And hold on him.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I'm sorry.

     INT. JOE'S COMPUTER SCREEN

     A screen which says Reply and which now reads "I'm sorry."

     INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

     On Joe at his computer, staring at the screen.

                    JOE
          Asshole.

     He backspaces, deleting.  Starts typing again.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say.
          Truly I don't.  And anything I do say
          will sound trite.  I hope you feel
          better.

     He sits there, appalled at his own triteness.

     EXT. JOE'S STREET - NIGHT

     As a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of Joe's
     building.

                    PATRICIA (V.O.)
          What I was thinking was she'd probably
          make a great children's book either.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Why would you think that?

     They get out of the cab.

                    PATRICIA
          She knows everything.  She has flawless
          taste.  She's famous for it.
          The salesmen swear by her.  If she likes
          it, it sells.  Period.

     INT. JOE'S LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

     As they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator.

                    JOE
          So you're going to offer her a job?

                    PATRICIA
          Why not?  What else has she got to do?

                    JOE
          Now that she's destitute --

                    PATRICIA
          Thanks to you.

                    JOE
          Well, I can't imagine her working for
          you.

                    PATRICIA
          Why not?

                    JOE
          She has a horrible personality, she's...
          nice to everyone all the time.  It's
          exhausting.  And her staff turnover is
          ... non-existent.  They've been there
          forever.  Until... recently, when they
          all found out they were going to lose
          their jobs.

                    PATRICIA
          Thanks to you.

     The elevator door is closing.

                    PATRICIA (cont'd)
          Hold the elevator!

     They get in.

     INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

                    JOE
          Hello, Charlie, Veronica.

                    PATRICIA
          Last time, we rode in an elevator, we
          made the deal of the century.  What is
          going to happen this time?

                    CHARLIE
          Miss Grant's going to get me a part in
          one of her movies, that's what's going
          to happen.

                    VERONICA
          In your dream, Charlie.

                    PATRICIA
               (back to the conversation with
                Joe)
          I love how you've totally forgotten you
          had any role in her current situation.
          It's so obtuse.  It reminds me of someone
          ... Who?  Who does it remind me of?
               (thinks for a moment)
          Me!

     The elevator suddenly stops.

                    PATRICIA
          Shit.

                    VERONICA
          Shit.

                    JOE
          It is stuck?

                    CHARLIE
          Could be.

     He pushes the open button.  Nothing.  Turns the key, hits the
     open button, flicks the emergency switch.  The he starts
     hitting the buttons in every possible combination.

                    JOE
          Charlie, what are you doing?

                    CHARLIE
          Bang the door.

                    PATRICIA
          Really.

     Joe bangs the door.  Nothing.

                    CHARLIE
          I hope this thing doesn't plummet to the
          basement.

                    VERONICA
          Can it do that?

                    JOE
          No.

     He picks up the phone.

                    JOE
          This is Joe Fox.  Who is this?  Hi, Juan.
          We're stuck on the sixth floor.  There
          are four of us --

                    PATRICIA
               (grabs the phone)
          -- and if you don't get your ass up here
          in two shakes and get us out --

     He hangs up.

                    JOE
               (to Veronica)
          Are you all right?

                    VERONICA
          It's hot.

     Joe hands her his handkerchief.

                    CHARLIE
          Everyone should jump in the air.

                    PATRICIA
          What?

                    CHARLIE
          We jump.  The elevator thinks that no one
          is here and it opens.

     Everyone stares at each other.

                    JOE
          One -- two -- three --

     They all jump into the air.

     They all land.

     Nothing happens.

     INT. ELEVATOR - A LITTLE LATER

     Patricia is sitting on the elevator floor, polishing her
     nails.

     We hear the fire department banging outside...

                    VERONICA
          If I ever get out of here, I'm going to
          start speaking to my mother.  She slept
          with Oscar, and maybe it was Oscar's
          fault, I don't know, and then she sold
          the story to Inside Edition.
          That could have been Oscar's idea, too.
          Who knows?  But I divorced him.  I wonder
          what she's doing right this minute.  I
          think of her... whenever I hear about a
          new pill.  Ecstasy, Zoloft, Fenphen, I
          just think, I hope Mama knows about that.

     She takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes.

                    PATRICIA
          Maybe you can make up on Rosie.  That
          would be so great for the book.

                    CHARLIE
               (trying to figure it out)
          If I ever get out of here...

                    PATRICIA
          If I ever get out of here, I'm having my
          eyes lasered.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm marrying Oreet.  I love her.  I
          should marry her.  I don't know what's
          been stopping me.

     He takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of Oreet,
     shows it to Joe.

                    JOE
          If I ever get out of here, I'm going to --

     He stops, he looks at Patricia who is fishing through her
     purse.

                    PATRICIA
          Where is my TicTacs?
               (looks at Joe)
          What?

     The firemen crowbar open the elevator door.

     EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - NIGHT

     Joe and Brinkley walk out on the dock toward Joe's boat.  Joe
     is carrying Brinkley's pillow, his laptop and a suitcase.

     He boards his boat and goes below.  A light goes on.  We hear
     the sound of the computer.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          I came home tonight and got into the
          elevator to go to my apartment.  An hour
          later, I got out of the elevator and
          Brinkley and I moved out.  Suddenly
          everything had become clear.
               (continued)

     INT. BOAT - NIGHT

     A small sleeping area with a berth and a little table, where
     Joe's laptop has been hooked up to the phone.

     Joe is on the narrow berth, as is Brinkley.

                    JOE (V.O., cont'd)
          It's a long story.  Full of the personal
          details we avoid so carefully...

     Joe puts Brinkley on the floor, on his pillow.  Brinkley
     jumps back onto the berth with Joe.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Kathleen is making tea.  She starts toward the bedroom.  We
     see her computer, now hooked up in the living room, where all
     of Frank's typewriters used to be.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I wonder whether change isn't a kind of
          infection.  You start with one thing --
          something you never ever thought would
          change and it does --
               (continued)

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          and the next thing you know even your bed
          is in a different place.
               (continued)

     Kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has
     been rearranged.

     She gets into bed and turns on the television set.

     EXT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - DUSK

     The bookshelves are empty.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O., cont'd)
          Six months ago, when you and I first met,
          I knew everything about myself -- what I
          would be doing for the rest of my life
          and even the person I would be doing it
          with.  Now I know nothing.

     On the door is a small sign.  "After 42 years, we are closing
     our doors.  We have loved being part of your lives."

     Kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door.

     The little bell over the door jingles.

     Kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches
     it.

     Then she comes out of the store, carrying the bell.

     Kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate
     for the last time.

     The grate starts to lower.

     Kathleen looks at her store, one last time.  Then she walks
     off, carrying the bell.  We hear it jingle in the night.

     And hold on The Shop Around the Corner, and it slowly turns
     into a computer-enhanced version of itself.

     And then, suddenly, it vanishes with a poof, leaving an empty
     screen.

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     George is now the head of the children department at the
     store and he is sitting in the children's section on an itty-
     bitty chair.  His staff is sitting on little itty-bitty
     chairs too.

                    GEORGE
          Then, in the 19th century, Caldecott
          revolutionized the publishing of
          children's books by the introduction of
          color illustrations --

     We see:

     Several are dozing.

     EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE & 72ND - DAY

     Joe walks past the Eleanor Roosevelt statue.  He's with
     Annabel and Matt:

                    JOE
          What about going to the Children's Zoo?

                    ANNABEL
          I don't want to go to the Children's Zoo.

                    JOE
          Okay.  The Staten Island Ferry.

                    ANNABEL
          I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

                    MATT
          I want to go to the Storybook Lady.

                    JOE
          Well we can't go to the Storybook Lady.

     INT. JAPANESE NOODLE RESTAURANT - DAY

     Annabel is sitting in her chair, staring glumly at a bowl of
     Japanese soup and noodles.

                    JOE
          I'll read you a story.

                    ANNABEL
          Where did she go?

                    JOE
          She had to close her store.

                    ANNABEL
          Why?

                    JOE
          She didn't have enough business.

                    ANNABEL
          Why?

                    JOE
          Well.  Her store was very close to our
          store, and you know our store sells books
          at a slightly lower cost --

                    ANNABEL
          Why?

                    JOE
          Why do we sell at a lower cost?  So more
          people can buy books.

                    ANNABEL
          Why couldn't she sell that way too?

                    JOE
          Because she's small and we're big.  How
          about we go get some candy?

                    ANNABEL
          So now she's gone and it's all your
          fault.

                    JOE
          It's business, Annabel.  It's not
          personal.  How about we go get so much
          candy you'll be bouncing off the walls
          for days?

                    MATT
          What's personal?

                    ANNABEL
          Personal means that she's gone forever,
          and now we'll never get another book from
          her as long as we ever live.

     She burst into tears.  Matt bursts into tears too.

                    JOE
          Remember the man who worked with her?

                    ANNABEL
               (a wail)
          No.

                    JOE
          Well I hired him.

                    ANNABEL
          You killed the Storybook Lady.

     Matt throws himself on the ground, crying.

     Annabel sobs hysterically.

     INT. FOXBOOKS SUPERSTORE - DAY

     George is wearing the same pointed hat Kathleen wore as the
     Storybook Lady.  There's a sign that says: Storybook Person.

     Several children are listening.

     We see:

     ANNABEL

     She's glowering.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Kathleen is in bed with a huge box of Kleenex.  She has a 
     terrible cold.  Her nose is red, her eyes are watery.  On the
     bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers, pills, etc.

     We hear the sound of computer keys clicking.

                     JOE (V.O.)
          Why haven't you written?

                         KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I have a cold.

     INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

     We see Joe on his computer.

                         JOE (V.O.)
          How's your cold?

                         KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          My ears are blocked, my nose is clogged.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     She's drinking cranberry juice.  Joni Mitchell on the stereo.

     The sound of computer keys clicking again.

                         JOE (V.O.)
          Are you feeling any better?

                         KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I'm lying in bed listening to Joni
          Mitchell and drinking cranberry juice
          which I am sorry to say is the exact same
          color as my nose.  I keep thinking about
          my future.  What future?  What am I 
          going to do?

     EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - LATE AFTERNOON

     As Joe is walking Brinkley back to the boat.  A limousine has
     pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags.
     Joe stops to see the passenger: his father, Nelson Fox.

                    JOE
          What are you doing here?

     EXT. 79TH STREET BOAT BASIN - DUSK

     Next to Joe's boat is a larger yacht.

     INT. YACHT - NIGHT

     In the main cabin Joe and Nelson are having drinks.  Nelson
     lifts his glass in a toast.

                    NELSON
          To us.

                    JOE
          Father and son, together at last.  That
          happened with Gillian?

     Nelson ignores the question.

                    NELSON
          I've stayed here after, let's see, your
          mother, Laurette that ballet dancer --

                    JOE
          -- the nanny --

                    NELSON
          Was she the nanny?  I forgot that.  How
          ironic.  Then there was the ice skater --

                    JOE
          -- also the nanny --

                    NELSON
          Really.  How amazingly ironic.  Sybil the
          astrologer.

                    JOE
          Whose moon turned out to be in somebody
          else's house, as I recall.

                    NELSON
          Just like Gillian.

                    JOE
          Gillian ran off with someone?

                    NELSON
          The nanny.

                    JOE
          Nanny Maureen?  Gillian ran off with
          Nanny Maureen?  That's incredibly
          ironic.

                    NELSON
          True true.

                    JOE
          There's no other word for it.

                    NELSON
          Who did you break up with?

                    JOE
          Patricia.  You met her.

                    NELSON
          Would I like her?
               (cracks himself up)
          Just kidding.  Isn't this great?  Have
          some peanuts.  Of course I have to live
          out of a suitcase for a least three
          weeks, and then there's the inevitable
          legal hassle, more of your inheritance
          down the drain.

                    JOE
          Don't worry about it.

                    NELSON
          I won't.  But then I get to meet someone
          new.  That's the easy part.

                    JOE
          Oh, right, a snap to find the one single
          person in the world who fills your heart
          with joy.

                    NELSON
          Don't be ridiculous.  Have I ever been
          with anyone who fits that description?
          Have you?

                    JOE
          On to the next.

                    NELSON
          Isn't it a beautiful night?

     Hold on Joe.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S STREET - DAY

     Joe, on his way to Kathleen's apartment building, carrying a
     bunch of daisies, wrapped in cellophane.

     Joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer.
     Sees Kelly, 3A.  He presses.  Nothing.  Presses again.

                    KATHLEEN
               (voice clogged, through
                intercom)
          Who is it?

                    JOE
          Joe Fox.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     Kathleen, in her pajamas, at the intercom, horrified.

                    KATHLEEN
          What are you doing here?

                    JOE
          May I please come up?

                    KATHLEEN
          It's really not a good idea.

     Someone else walks up to the door, unlocks it and walks in.
     Joe follows.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

                    KATHLEEN
               (into the intercom)
          I have a terrible cold, can you hear it?
          I'm sniffling and not really awake --

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

     As Kathleen continues to talk through the Intercom to an
     empty stoop.

                    KATHLEEN'S VOICE
          and I'm sleeping practically twenty-four
          hours a day, and taking echinacea --

     INT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

                    KATHLEEN
               (into intercom)
          -- and vitamin C, so I would really
          appreciate it if you would come some
          other time --

     There's a knock on the door right next to her.  Kathleen
     practically jumps out of her skin.  She looks through the
     peephole.  There he is.

                    JOE
          Kathleen?

                    KATHLEEN
          Just a second.

     She puts on a robe, runs frantically about picking up various
     scattered wadded-up Kleenexs, opens the front door.  Joe is
     holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper.

                    JOE
          Hello.

                    KATHLEEN
          What are you doing here?

                    JOE
          I heard you were sick and I was worried
          and I wanted to --
               (he hears voices)
          Is someone here?

                    KATHLEEN
          Just the Home Shopping Network.

                    JOE
          Bought any porcelain dolls?

                    KATHLEEN
          I was thinking about it.
               (beat)
          You put me out of business --

                    JOE
          I know that --

                    KATHLEEN
          And now you turn up with flowers?  Did
          you come to gloat?

                    JOE
          No.

                    KATHLEEN
          To offer me a job --

                    JOE
          No, I wouldn't think of --

                    KATHLEEN
          Because I have plans, I have lots of
          offers.  I've been offered a job by --
          well, actually by --

                    JOE
          My former?

                    KATHLEEN
          Former?

                    JOE
          We broke up.

                    KATHLEEN
          That's too bad.  You seemed so perfect
          for each other.
               (she claps her hand over her
                mouth)
          I don't mean to say things like that.  No
          matter what you have done to me, there is
          no excuse for my saying anything like
          that.  But every time I see you --

                    JOE
          Things like that just seem to fly out of
          your mouth.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm starting over.
               (sharply)
          Thank you for coming.  Goodbye.
               (she says it again, a little
                more nicely)
          Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

     She starts to the door.

                    JOE
          I bought you flowers.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh.
               (trying as hard as she can)
          Thank you.

     She takes them.

     He takes them back.

                    JOE
          Why don't I put them in water?

     He heads for the kitchen.  A beat, while she stares after him.
     Then follows.

     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     When Kathleen gets to the kitchen, Joe is checking the kettle
     for water.  Turns on the stove.

                    JOE
          You're sick.  Sit down, please.

     He pulls out a kitchen chair.  Kathleen sits.  She's a little
     woozy.

                    JOE
          Vase?

                    KATHLEEN
          Upper left.

     He gets out a vase.  Fills it with water.

                    JOE
          George says hello.  He told me you
          weren't feeling well.

                    KATHLEEN
          How is George?

                    JOE
          Great.  He's revolutionizing the place.
          No one is allowed to work in his
          department who doesn't have a Ph.D. in
          children's literature.

     He unwraps the paper around the flowers.  Daisies.  Puts them
     in a vase.

                    KATHLEEN
          I love daisies.

                    JOE
          You told me.

     He puts the vase on the kitchen table.  Kathleen plays with
     the petals.

                    KATHLEEN
          They're so friendly.  Don't you think
          they are the friendliest flower?

                    JOE
          I do.

                    KATHLEEN
          When did you break up?

                    JOE
          Oh, a couple of weeks ago.

                    KATHLEEN
          Everyone is breaking up.  You.  Me.  This
          other person I know broke up with someone
          in an elevator.  I think it was in an
          elevator.  Or just outside it.  Or after
          it.  It got stuck.  I think.  And suddenly
          everything became clear.  When I saw you,
          at the coffee place, I was waiting for him
          and I was --

                    JOE
          -- charming.

                    KATHLEEN
          I was not charming.

                    JOE
          Well, you looked charming.

     The teakettle whistles.  Joe turns off the burner.

                    JOE
          Tea?

                    KATHLEEN
          Upper right.

     He gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water.

                    KATHLEEN
          I was upset.  And I was horrible.

                    JOE
          Honey?

     Kathleen nods.  He puts in two spoonfuls, gives it to her.

                    JOE
          I was horrible.

                    KATHLEEN
          True.  But I have no excuse.

     She picks up the daisies and carries them into:

     INT. KATHLEEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Joe follows her.  They both sit.

                    JOE
          Whereas I am a horrible person and have
          no choice but to be horrible, is that
          what you're saying?

                    KATHLEEN
          No I am not saying that because I am done
          saying horrible things, even to you.

                    JOE
          You did it again.

     She claps her hand over her mouth.

                    JOE
          I put you out of business.  You're
          entitled to hate me.

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't hate you --

                    JOE
          But you'll never forgive me.  Like
          Elizabeth.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who?

                    JOE
          Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice.
          She was too proud --

                    KATHLEEN
          I thought you hated Pride and Prejudice.

                    JOE
          -- or was she too prejudiced and Mr.
          Darcy too proud?  I can never remember.
               (beat)
          It wasn't personal --

                    KATHLEEN
          -- It was business.  What is that
          supposed to mean?  I am so sick of that.
          All it means is it's not personal to you,
          but it's personal to me, it's personal to
          a lot of people.
               (she shrugs helplessly)
          What's wrong with personal anyway?

                    JOE
          Nothing.

                    KATHLEEN
          I mean, whatever else anything is, it
          ought to begin by being personal.

     Kathleen stands up, picks up the daisies.

                    KATHLEEN
          My head's starting to get funny.  I have
          to go back to bed.

     They walk to...

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it.
     She fluffs up the pillows, pulls up the blankets, surrounds
     herself with Kleenex and Evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze.

                    KATHLEEN
          Why did you stop by?  I forget.

                    JOE
          I wanted to be your friend.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh.

                    JOE
          I knew it wasn't possible.  What can I
          say?  Sometimes a person just wants the
          impossible.  Could I ask you something?

                    KATHLEEN
          What?

                    JOE
          What happened with that guy at the cafe?

                    KATHLEEN
          Nothing.

                    JOE
          But you're crazy about him --

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes.  I am.

                    JOE
          Then why don't you run off with him?
          What are you waiting for?

     A long beat.

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't actually know him.

                    JOE
          Really.

                    KATHLEEN
          We only know each other -- oh God, you're
          not going to believe this --

                    JOE
          Let me guess.  From the Internet.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes.

                    JOE
          You've Got Mail.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes.

                    JOE
          Very powerful words.

                    KATHLEEN
          Yes.

     Joe sits on the edge of the bed.

                    JOE
          I'm happy for him.  Although -- could I
          make a little suggestion?  I think you
          should meet him.  No.  I take it back.
          Why meet him?

                    KATHLEEN
               (starting to get sharp again)
          I hardly think I need advice from someone
          who --

     He reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth.  And
     holds it there.  It's unexpectedly tender and sexy.

                    JOE
          I concede I bring out the worst in you,
          but let me help you not to say something
          you'll just torture yourself about for
          years to come.

     She starts to smile and he removes his hand.

     They look at each other.

                    JOE
          I hope you're better soon.  It would be 
          a shame to miss New York in the spring.

     Joe stands.

                    KATHLEEN
          Thank you for the daisies.

     He starts for the door.

                    JOE
          Take care.

                    KATHLEEN
          I will.

                    JOE
          Goodbye.

                    KATHLEEN
          Goodbye.

     We hear the door close.

     Hold on Kathleen.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

     Christina is running.  She sees a good-looking MALE RUNNER
     coming toward her.  She has no hope that he will notice her,
     and starts to look away as they get close to one another.

                    MALE RUNNER
          Hi.

                    CHRISTINA
          Hi.

     He passes her.  Christina can't believe it.

     She does a little dance of joy.

     Camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a 
     beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin.

     Then she resumes her morning exercise, running on.

     INT. THE SINGLES TEMPLE - FRIDAY EVENING

     Patricia comes in.

     The place is packed.  There are hundreds of young Jewish New
     Yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora.  The Rabbi
     is dancing among them.

     Patricia sees the rabbi, leading the dance.

     The rabbi whirls madly toward her, like a human dreidel.

                    RABBIT
          Shabbat shalom!

     He grabs Patricia's hand, and to her surprise, they go
     whirling off together.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Kathleen at the computer, typing.

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I have been thinking about this and
          I think we should meet.

     She clicks the send button and then exits from American On
     Line.

     On her computer screen we now see the standard screen with
     several icons: American On-Line, Word, Recycle Bin, etc.

     She clicks Word.

     She goes to File: New.

     There are several choices of format.

     She stares at the choices.  Then she clicks Book format.

     A blank page appears in the computer.

     She starts to type:  "Once upon a time there was a little
     girl named..."

     She pauses for a moment and looks around the room.  She sees
     the flowers that Joe brought her.

     And then she types: "Daisy."

     As she goes on typing...

     INT. JOE' BOAT - NIGHT

     On Joe typing.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          We should meet.  And we will meet.  But
          I'm in the middle of a project that
          needs...
               (he pauses to think of the
                right word)
          ... tweaking.

     A look of calculation on his face.

     EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY

     We can see Kathleen through the window, drinking a cup of
     coffee.

     And now we see Joe walk into Starbucks.  He waves at her,
     pretending surprise at seeing her.  Has he been watching the
     store and waiting for her to come in?  We'll never know.

     INT. STARBUCKS - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     He's sitting next to her at the counter in the window.

                    JOE
          Tweaking?

                    KATHLEEN
          That's what he said.

                    JOE
          He's probably married.

                    KATHLEEN
          That's a terrible thing to say.  It's not
          possible.

                    JOE
          Have you asked him if he's married?  Have
          you said, "Are you married?"

                    KATHLEEN
          No.

     Joe looks at her, shrugs.

     INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     As she types:

                    KATHLEEN (V.O.)
          I know this is probably a little late to
          be asking, but are you married?

     INT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     As he answers:

                    JOE (V.O.)
          Am I married?  What kind of a question is
          that?  How can you ask me that?  Don't
          you know me at all?  Oh wait, I get it.
          Your friends are telling you the reason
          we haven't met is that I'm married.  Am I
          right?

     INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - ANOTHER DAY

     Kathleen and Joe having nachos.

                    JOE
          So he didn't exactly answer.

                    KATHLEEN
          He did too.  He nailed me.  He knew
          exactly what I was up to.  Which is just
          like him.

                    JOE
          But he didn't exactly answer, did he?
          Did he?

                    KATHLEEN
          No.

                    JOE
          Maybe he's fat.

                    KATHLEEN
          I don't care about that.

                    JOE
          You don't care that he might be one of
          those guys who's so fat he has to be
          removed from his house with a crane?

                    KATHLEEN
          That's very unlikely.

                    JOE
          Why else do you think he's putting off
          meeting you?  Although... maybe that's
          not it.  Maybe...

                    KATHLEEN
          What?

                    JOE
          Never mind.

                    KATHLEEN
          What????

                    JOE
          He could be waiting til he's paroled.

                    KATHLEEN
          Oh, you won't believe this, there was a
          moment when George thought he might be
          the rooftop killer, which was completely
          ridiculous --

     Her voice trails off, as she considers whether it could be
     true.

                    JOE
          What's his handle?

     She shakes her head.

                    JOE
          Come on, I'm not going to write him.  Is
          that what you think?

                    KATHLEEN
          NY 152.

                    JOE
          One five two.  One hundred fifty two.
          Very interesting.  He's 152 years old.
          He has 152 hairs remaining on his head.
          He's had 152 moles removed and now he
          has 152 pockmarks.

     EXT. FARMER'S MARKET ON BROADWAY - LATER

     As they walk past tables of bread and flowers, etc.

                    JOE
          His combined college board scores.

                    KATHLEEN
          His IQ.

                    JOE
          The number of women he's slept with.

                    KATHLEEN
          The number of times he's seen The
          Godfather.

                    JOE
          That's the first good thing I've heard
          about him.

                    KATHLEEN
          His address.  No, no, no.  He would never
          do anything that prosaic.

     On Joe, looking a little wounded.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          The only thing I really care about
          besides the married thing... and the
          jail thing... is the boat thing.

                    JOE
          The boat thing?

                    KATHLEEN
          I could never be with anyone who has
          a boat.

                    JOE
          Oh.

                    KATHLEEN
          So that clinches it.  We'll never be
          together.  I'll take care of these.

     He picks up a mango, squeezes it.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          I could never be with anyone who likes
          Joni Mitchell.
               (singing, imitating Joni)
          "It's cloud's illusions I recall, I
          really don't know clouds at all."  
          What does that mean?

     Joe waits for Kathleen to say she likes Joni Mitchell.

     But Kathleen doesn't say anything.

     She starts intently picking over apples, trying to find some
     she wants.

                    JOE
          How's your book coming?

     EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

     As they walk away from the market, going uptown.

                    KATHLEEN
          There's a children's book editor I know,
          from the store, and she's excited to 
          read it.  When I finish it.  Who would 
          ever have thought I'd write?  I mean,
          if I didn't have all this free time, I
          would never have discovered --

     She stops, realizing what she's saying.

                    KATHLEEN (cont'd)
          The truth is, he was the one who made me
          start thinking about writing --

                    JOE
          Mister 152 Felony Indictments --

                    KATHLEEN
          Mister 152... insights into my soul.

                    JOE
          Yes.  Well.  Can't compete with that.

                    KATHLEEN
          Well.  I keep bumping into you.  Hope
          your mango's ripe.

                    JOE
          I think it is.  Want to bump into me
          Saturday?  Around lunchtime?

     EXT. COMPUTER SCREEN - NIGHT

     As Joe types.

                    JOE (V.O.)
          How about meeting Saturday?  The first
          day of spring.  4 P.M.  There's a place
          in Riverside Park at 88th Street where
          the path curves and when you come around
          the curve, you'll find me waiting.

     INT./EXT. SATURDAY - GREY'S PAPAYA - THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING

     Kathleen and Joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs.

                    JOE
          Today?

                    KATHLEEN
          Today.

                    JOE
          Whoa.

                    KATHLEEN
          I know.  In Riverside Park.

                    JOE
          Isn't that amazing?  Maybe I've seen him,
          and I don't even know it.

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - DAY

     As they walk uptown, eating their hot dogs and drinking
     papaya drinks.

                    JOE
          He could be the Zipper Man.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who's that?

                    JOE
          This guy on Amsterdam who repairs
          zippers.  You'll never have to buy new
          luggage.

                    KATHLEEN
          Stop teasing.

                    JOE
          Timing is everything.  He waited until
          you were primed.  Until you knew there
          was no other man you could ever love.

                    KATHLEEN
               (almost believe it)
          Yes.

                    JOE
          Sometimes I wonder...

                    KATHLEEN
          What?

     They stop walking, they look at each other.

                    JOE
          If I hadn't been Foxbooks and you hadn't
          been The Shop Around the Corner and we'd
          just met --

                    KATHLEEN
          Don't.

                    JOE
          I would have asked for your phone number
          and I wouldn't have been able to wait 24
          hours before calling and asking, "How
          about coffee, drinks, dinner, a movie,
          for as long as we both shall live?"

                    KATHLEEN
               (almost a swoon)
          Joe...

                    JOE
          And then we would never have been at war.

                    KATHLEEN
          No.

                    JOE
          The only fight we'd ever have is what
          video to rent on Saturday night.

                    KATHLEEN
          Who fights about that?

                    JOE
          Some people.  Not us.

                    KATHLEEN
          We would never.

     A long beat.

                    JOE
          If only...

                    KATHLEEN
          Please.  I have to go.

     She doesn't move.

                    JOE
          Let me ask you something?  How come
          you'll forgive him for standing you
          up and you won't forgive me for a 
          little tiny thing like putting you
          out of business?

     Kathleen looks at him.  Shakes her head.

     They look at each other.

                    JOE
          Oh how I wish you would.

     It's all Kathleen can do not to forgive him.

     It's all Joe can do not to kiss her.

                    KATHLEEN
          I really do have to go.

                    JOE
          You don't want to be late.

     She's in agony.

     He turns and walks away.

     After a moment, she does too.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

     As we see Kathleen come down the street and walk into her
     house.

     EXT. KATHLEEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

     As she comes out of the apartment house, having changed her
     clothes.

     EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - LATER AFTERNOON

     As she comes toward the entrance to the park.

     EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

     As Kathleen comes down a path in the park, near 88th Street.

     She comes to a stop.

     Looks around.

     A young woman in running clothes passes by.

     A young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers
     runners use to push babies in.

     Kathleen looks at her watch.

     Suddenly she hears a noise.  A dog barking.

     And Brinkley comes around the corner.

                    VOICE
          Brinkley!  Brinkley!

     And hold on Kathleen as she sees.

     JOE

     And she starts to cry.

     And he comes to her.  And puts his arms around her.

                    JOE
          Don't cry, Shopgirl, don't cry.

                    KATHLEEN
          I wanted it to be you.  I wanted it to
          be you so badly.

     And as they kiss, we hold on them.

     And crane up and away as we see them, a couple kissing in the
     park on a beautiful spring day.

     A dog is leaping around them.

     And as we get further and further away from them, the screen
     turns into

     CYBERSPACE

     And the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops.

     And we tilt up to see the clouds and the sky

     and hear the sound of computer keys, clicking, clicking,
     clicking

                         FADE OUT
