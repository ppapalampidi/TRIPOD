1   INT. KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY                                      1

    ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control,
    walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.

                        ABBY
              Morning, Freddy.

                        SECURITY GUARD
              Morning, Abby. Another peaceful
              day?

                        ABBY
              If you say so...

2   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                  2

    JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.

                        JOY
                  (panicked)
              We've got problems.

                         ABBY
              There are no problems, Joy.   Only
              solutions.

                        JOY
              The sky-cam on the traffic copter
              has a cracked lens and they can't
              fix it.

                         ABBY
              Okay, that's a problem.
                (thinking, then...)
              Call Matt Hardwick down at Media
              Services. He's got a few Sky Cams
              and he owes me. Now, where are my
              weathermen?

    Joy opens a door to a waiting area.

3   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS                 3

    Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.

                           LATINO MEN
              Hey there!

                           ABBY
              Hi, guys!

    Abby waves back and closes the door.

                 What's with the pot bellies?

                           JOY
                 Research shows people like fat
                 weathermen. It makes them feel
                 safe.

                           ABBY
                 I like the one in the green and the
                 one in the brown, but I want to see
                 the one in the green with less
                 sideburns and the one in the brown
                 with more, then I'll make my
                 decision.

                           LARRY (O.S.)
                 Abby!

    LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to
    them. He wears a makeup bib.

                           ABBY
                 Morning, Larry.

                           LARRY
                 I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
                 but I don't think I can work with
                 her anymore. It's bad enough I
                 have to take her criticism at home.
                 I can't do it on air, too. A man
                 can only take so much.

    Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done
    this before.

                           ABBY
                 You're not a man, Larry...
                     (off his look)
                 You're a newsman. A newsman isn't
                 defined by the easy times, Larry,
                 he's defined by the difficult ones.
                 Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris
                 Hansen or Anderson Cooper having
                 their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,
                 because they couldn't handle it.
                 But you can. You've got balls the
                 size of Volkswagens. Don't think I
                 haven't noticed.

                  (re his balls)
              I've only thought of them as blue
              as of late, but you're right. They
              are quite sizeable. But not
              disproportionately so.
                  (with pride)
              I like to think of them as
              aesthetically pleasing --

    Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore
    than she has to.

                        ABBY
              I think I've made my point.

    Larry nods, appeased, as she reaches the door marked ABBY
    RICHTER, PRODUCER, "ALBUQUERQUE A.M." She enters and...

    ...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry
    news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.

                        DORI
              Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a                              *
              crap about trees in Alaska! It's
              not newsworthy.

                        JOSH
              Oh, but full coverage on David
              Beckham's new tattoo is vital?!

    Larry's wife and co-anchor, GEORGIA, 40 and coiffed to the
    gills, storms in, followed by the show's GUEST CHEF.

                        GEORGIA
              He's trying to kill me! He knows I
              can't eat crab, I'm allergic to it!
                  (to the room)
              Does anyone see this? Is this a
              hive?

                        JOSH
              It looks like syphilis to me.

                        DORI
                  (to Josh)
              See that? You wouldn't even know
              what syphilis looks like if it
              weren't for my story on Paris
              Hilton.

                 She doesn't eat crab or beef or
                 fish. She doesn't eat anything but
                 chicken. You don't need a chef on
                 this show. You need a box of
                 McNuggets.

    Everyone shouts at each other. Abby calmly pulls out a
    whistle, puts it to her mouth and BLOWS.

    Cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set.
    Georgia and Larry taste samples of what he's prepared.

                 I have to tell you, Bruce. This is
                 the best Chicken Kiev I've ever
                 tasted.

                           GUEST CHEF
                 Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes
                 an excellent alternative for
                 chicken, Georgia.

    JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite.

                           JAVIER
                 Can I take home the leftovers?

    They all laugh.

                 preserve the ancient forests of

    Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly
    general manager.

                           STUART
                 Have you seen the ratings for
                 yesterday? We got beat by all the
                 network shows, plus a rerun of
                 "Who's the Boss". The one where
                 the vacuum breaks.

                           ABBY
                 It's a temporary setback. This week
                 we'll do better.

                            STUART
                 The guy with the cable access show
                 on Channel 83 does better. If we
                 programed Jerry Springer re-runs,
                 we'd do a nine share at a quarter
                 the price.

    Abby looks worried.

                           ABBY
                 Please tell me you're not thinking
                 of killing the show.

                           STUART
                 I'm not, but I can guarantee you
                 that's what the new management's
                 thinking.

                 We're not a family-run station
                 anymore, Abby. You're good at what
                 you do, but you've got to get me
                 some numbers. I've got two
                 daughters in college and a son in

                  What? I'm married. I live
                  vicariously through your dating
                  life. And I really think that this
                  could be our next boyfriend. C'mon,
                  he had nine out of ten items on
                  your checklist.

                            ABBY
                  Well, technically eight and a half.
                  He said he could cook, but when I
                  pressed him, he was completely
                  unfamiliar with cumin. Don't you
                  think that's a little suspicious?

     Off Joy's look, we CUT TO...

                  Hi. I'm looking for a guy with
                  sandy brown hair, athletic build,
                  and blue eyes... he's 5'9 which --
                  I know what you're thinking -- it's
                  a little short, but he's read The
                  Great Gatsby twice, so we'll just
                  live with it, okay?

                            JIM (O.S.)
                  Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.

     She turns, mortified, to see JIM, 30's and good-looking.
     Actually, he's better looking in person than in his photo.
     Abby gulps.

                  Shall I show you to your table?

     Abby and a mildly perturbed Jim follow, clearly not off to a
     banner start.

11   INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT                                11

     Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.

                  You know what? This is not the best
                  angle. We should get the table over
                  there. Then we both get a view,
                  instead of one of us looking at the
                  busboy station.

                            JIM
                  I'm fine here.

                            ABBY
                  No, trust me. It'll be better over
                  there.

     He looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move.

                  Can I get you some water for the
                  table?

                            JIM
                  Bottle of flat, please.

                            ABBY
                  You know, they've done studies that
                  show tap water is no different from
                  bottled water. And they passed a
                  law recently to have all
                  restaurants filter their tap water.
                  So, technically it's not tap water.

                  It's filtered water, which is
                  exactly what bottled water is,
                  except you don't have to pay $7 for
                  it.

                  Yeah, I still like the way it
                  tastes better.

                  I do, I just feel like having a
                  scotch right now.

     She looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.

                  Actually, my associate producer
                  did. She likes me to be prepared.
                  Not that I'm ever not prepared.
                  Kudos on your comprehensive car
                  insurance policy, by the way.

                  That wasn't in my profile.

               Good point.

     There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out
     another piece of paper, and hands it to him.

               I printed out some talking points
               for us just in case this happened.

                         JIM

               sure this goes as smoothly as
               possible.

     As Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.

                            JIM
               Thank you.

     He takes a huge sip, relieved. Abby looks at him.

               You realize the ice in that scotch

                  FYI, be sure to eat this by
                  tomorrow. With curry, you can't
                  smell if it's gone bad, so after
                  three days, you should just toss
                  it. Really, don't even give it to a
                  pet or anything.

                  wasted on self-help psycho­babble.

     Mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them
     ablaze. Then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a
     marshmallow. Begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Now listen up, ladies, cause I'm
                  only gonna say this once tonight
                  and it's just three little words.
                  No, they're not "I love you." Here
                  goes... MEN. ARE. SIMPLE. We can
                  not be trained. All this "Men Are
                  From Venus" bullshit is a waste of
                  your time and money.

                  You want to be a lonely hag, then
                  keep reading these stupid books.
                  You want a relationship, here's how
                  you get one: it's called a
                  Stairmaster. Get on it and get
                  skinny and get some trashy lingerie
                  because at the end of the day, all
                  we're interested in is looks. No
                  one falls in love with your
                  personality at first sight, they
                  fall in love with your tits and
                  your ass. And they stick around
                  because of what you're willing to
                  do with them. You want to win a man
                  over? You don't need ten steps. You
                  need one. And it's called a blow-
                  job.

     Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth.

21   INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                        21

     Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.

     WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike
     continues his rant.

                            MIKE
                  Men don't fall in love. Men fall in
                  "want." We want things. We're
                  hunters and gatherers. We're the
                  same as we were when we were
                  cavemen and a gillion years of
                  evolution hasn't done squat. Trust
                  me, there was a Pamela Anderson of
                  cave women and all the cave guys
                  were trying to stick their dicks in
                  her.

     Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it.
     He crosses it out and writes "LUST."

                            MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Now girls, if you want to think
                  lust is the same as love, that's
                  fine, but you're delusional. Let's
                  take some more calls.
                      (picks up the phone)
                  You're on the air.

     Abby is now on the phone.

                            ABBY
                  So you're saying men are incapable
                  of love?

                            MIKE
                  Did I burst your little Harlequin
                  Romance bubble?

     Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.                 *

                            ABBY
                  The only thing you burst is your
                  credibility. Men are absolutely
                  capable of experiencing love.

                            MIKE

                  who's so capable of love. Who is

                  Well, he's not like you, that's for
                  sure.

                  Thank you very much. Go on.

                  He's successful, but in a job that
                  means something. He loves red wine,
                  classical music, Cary Grant
                  movies...

                            MIKE
                  This is a guy in America, right?
                  You're not calling from Europe or
                  anything.

                  No, please. I'm loving this.

                             ABBY
                  He works out, not because he's
                  vain, because it's healthy. He's
                  socially liberal but fiscally
                  conservative. He likes dogs but
                  he's a cat person. He never gets

               Why are those qualities so
               threatening to you? Perhaps because
               your complete lack of any one of
               them is the real reason why women
               aren't interested in you. At least

                         STUART
               His name is Mike Alexander.

                            ABBY
               And he's a    quintessential
               misogynist    uber-moron who
               represents    everything wrong with
               television    and society at large...

                         DORI
               I get crap every time I suggest we
               do something even remotely fluffy
               and now you're gonna put this
               douchebag on the air?

                         STUART
               He's got a point of view. We don't
               have to like him, we're news
               people. We're objective. Stone
               Phillips interviews terrorists,
               doesn't mean he likes them. It's
               good for ratings.

     Abby holds up a piece of paper.

                         ABBY
               I've got a whole list of ideas on
               how to improve ratings. We don't
               need him.

     Stuart takes the memo, reading it.

                         STUART
               A live debate on immigration
               policy? Never work.

               What are you talking about?
               Albuquerque is 45% Latino.

     At this moment, MIKE walks in. Abby stares at him, appalled.

                         MIKE
               Yeah, and as you can tell by all
               the screaming rugrats in this town,
               Latino guys like to have a lot of
               sex. Which means they'd rather
               listen to me tell them how to bang
               hot chicks than hear about why they
               can't bring grandma across the
               border.

                         STUART
               See, what did I tell you? He's
               great.

                         MIKE
               Thanks, boss.

     Abby spins to face Stuart.

     A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears.

                         MIKE
               Hey, no hard feelings, right?

                         ABBY
               You don't even knock?

                         MIKE
               I knocked. I got no response.

                         ABBY
               So, essentially your knock was
               negated by your complete lack of
               adherence to the social etiquette
               of what follows a knock.

                  This is channel two. You do know

                  right? More people watch. So don't

               Alexander to go down in flames. I
               want Mike Alexander to be nothing
               but a pile of ash on the seat next
               to you. I want the janitor to come
               in with his Dustbuster and vacuum
               up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and
               then when he throws the ashes into
               the dumpster outside, I want the
               rats to vomit and then defecate on

                  about lowering television
                  standards. But many believe that

                  access show, "The Ugly Truth," have
                  brought things to a new low. With
                  that, we welcome Mike Alexander.

     In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out.

                         GEORGIA
               Well, what am I supposed to do,
               give up the money, so he can get an
               erection?

                         MIKE
               I agree. You've economically
               emasculated your husband to such a
               point that he's afraid to desire
               you. Sure, you can dump his ass,
               but honey, have you seen the
               eligible men in Albuquerque? It's
               slim pickings out there for a woman
               in her forties. You're not going to
               do any better than Larry. You just
               have to let him be a man. LET HIM
               BE A MAN, GEORGIA!

     Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of
     resistance, she melts into his arms. The crew goes crazy.
     Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set.

     It's pitch black. Suddenly a closet door is opened. Joy and
     Stuart stand in the doorway.

               Found her.

     Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet.

               One thousand, one hundred and forty-
               seven calls and over three hundred
               E-mails. And fifty-three percent of
               them were women. This guy's a

     Mike enters his apartment, throws his keys on the counter and
     hits play on his answering machine.

                  threw up in my car.

                  Last week on your show, you said
                  you should always be mean to hot
                  girls because they'll want you
                  more. I tried it today, she cried,

                  First of all - don't listen to what
                  I say on my show. Second of all,
                  you're supposed to do that to 25-
                  year-old girls who think they're
                  hot and can get any guy they want.
                  Not 14-year-old girls. They're
                  going through puberty. They have
                  enough problems.

                  Mom said when she was fourteen, she
                  was the prettiest girl in the
                  class.

                            MIKE
                  Well, I was there when she was
                  fourteen and let me tell you
                  something -- she lied.

     Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's
     uniform and holding a cake box.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he
                  was blind from masturbating too
                  much.

                            MIKE
                  Oh, that's a nice thing to tell
                  your son --

                            ELIZABETH
                  It's nothing worse than what he's
                  heard on your show.

     She hands him the cake box.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Let's hope you can clean it up now
                  that you're on a network. Congrats.

     She gives him a kiss on the cheek.      He grins.

                            MIKE
                  Thanks.

     He opens the box.

                  And camera one. Action Mike.

     Abby slips out of frame just in time. Mike looks to the

                  Ugly Truth," where we'll be taking
                  a few minutes every day to talk
                  about men, women and relationships.
                  Let's start with men. Men are
                  simple. To illustrate my point --
                  on my left we have the best our
                  world has to offer.

     He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner
     placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside
     the table, a man plays violin.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  You have a gourmet meal, fine wine,
                  classical music and great
                  literature.

     He picks up a copy of "Ulysses" from the table.

               Ah, I see you ladies have started
               without me.

     He smiles at TWO BLONDE TWINS IN BIKINIS, who wrestle in a
     kiddie pool of Jello.

     We INTERCUT with the control room.

     Colin step out of the shower. Abby takes a deep breath as he
     crosses to the mirror, giving her a look at his abs.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Oh, my, my...

     Abby leans closer to see Colin start flossing, wearing only a
     towel.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                      (a delighted gasp)
                  He flosses...

     Suddenly we hear a CRACK, and the branch breaks. Colin looks
     out the window and makes eye contact with Abby just as --

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Ahhhh!

     D'Artagnan leaps to another branch as Abby falls. As she
     plummets, her foot gets caught between some branches, leaving
     her now HANGING UPSIDE DOWN.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Help!

     The front lights SWITCH ON and Colin, still in a towel, races
     out of his condo. As he runs up to the tree --

                            COLIN
                  Just stay calm. You're gonna be
                  fine.

     The branch breaks.

               Ahhh!!!

     Abby FALLS to the ground but --

     Colin CATCHES her. But only for a moment.

     She DROPS out of his arms and onto the ground. As she goes,
     his TOWEL GOES WITH HER. Landing on her face.

                           COLIN
               Whoops.

     She pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye
     contact with the one-eyed trouser snake staring back at her.

                         ABBY

     Mike plays poker with his     buddies: DWAYNE (30's, chubby),
     STEVE (30's, Latino), and     GARY(30's, bespectacled). While
     Mike tries to concentrate     on the game, but the guys are more
     interested in reading his     fan mail.

                         DWAYNE
                   (reading)
               "Dear Mike, I know I'm the girl who
               can change you and make you fall in
               love. Here's a photo of me and my
               iguana."

     Steve looks at the photo.

                         STEVE
               I thought iguanas only liked dry
               places.

     He passes it to Gary.

                         GARY
               We might need to call animal
               control on this one.

                         MIKE
               Guys, enough with the fan mail.

                         STEVE
               What? You don't want to add her
               into your rotation?

39   INT. COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        39

     Unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays
     on the stereo. Colin, now in sweats and a t-shirt, examines
     Abby's ankle.

                            ABBY
                      (impressed)
                  You're a doctor?

                            COLIN
                  An orthopedic surgeon.

     She glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and
     a half empty wine glass sitting on a table.

                            COLIN
                  I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but
                  I do get the occasional foot. You
                  seem to be fine. No sprain.

                            ABBY
                  Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky
                  D'Artagnan picked your tree to
                  climb. Dave in the next unit over
                  sells lawn furniture. I don't know
                  that I would have been as confident
                  with his diagnosis.

                            COLIN
                  I'm here whenever you need me.

     Abby puts on her shoes as Colin opens his wallet and hands
     her a card.

                  My home number's on the back. If
                  the ankle starts giving you
                  problems, just give me a call.

     Colin picks up the cat, who starts purring.

                            ABBY
                  Wow, he doesn't usually like men.

                            COLIN
                  Dogs are great, but...well, you're
                  a cat person. You know.

     Abby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and
     utter perfection.

                            ABBY
                  Well, I guess I should get going
                  now.

     She remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling
     awkward, makes a move to open the door.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Thanks again for saving me.

                              COLIN
                  Any time.

     She walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he
     still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find --

     Abby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE. Startled, she quickly
     composes herself.

                            COLIN (CONT'D)
                  You forgot your cat.

                            ABBY
                      (re the dance)
                  Oh. Thanks. There was a -- spider.
                  On me. But it's gone now.

     He chuckles, hands her D'Artagnan.

                            COLIN
                  Good night.

     He closes the door.

                         ABBY
               I'm such an idiot --

     She starts doing a SELF-HATING SPAZZY DANCE, mocking her
     previous dance. Just as Colin opens the door again --

                         COLIN
               You alright?

     She freezes.

                         ABBY
               Yes. I'm going now. Good night.

     She walks off, trying to maintain her dignity.

               For your information, I happened to
               meet him last night.

                         MIKE
               I really hope he's real this time,
               because otherwise this is just sad.

                         ABBY
               Oh, he's very real. Not to mention
               stunningly handsome and morally
               sound. His name's Colin.

     Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while
     going over patient files.

                  Oh, hi. Everything okay?

     We INTERCUT.

                            ABBY
                  Couldn't be better. I just wanted
                  to call and tell you how much I
                  enjoyed meeting you.

     Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at
     him, but she can't stop him.

                            COLIN
                  Oh, thanks.

                            ABBY
                  So... I was just thinking that we
                  should have dinner.

                            COLIN
                      (not great)
                  Oh... great.

     Mike shakes his head, knowing where this is going.

                            ABBY
                  There's this new French Bistro that
                  got fantastic reviews and there's a
                  gallery opening in Old Town on
                  Friday. So, if you want, we could
                  have dinner, then go to the
                  opening.

                            COLIN
                  Hmmm, Friday... wow.

                  unsettled with the move and
                  everything so I`m really not --

                  He was not.

     She moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to
     stop her.

                            MIKE
                  Don't! He'll be expecting you to
                  call him back. When you don't,
                  he'll call you.

                            ABBY
                  How do you know?

                            MIKE
                  Because I know men. If you want it
                  to work out with this guy, you'll
                  listen to me and do exactly as I
                  say. You already did irreparable
                  damage with your psycho-aggressive
                  control freak phone call. It might
                  even be too late. Even if you do
                  salvage the situation, you'll
                  probably never be more than Abby,
                  his desperate neighbor.

                             ABBY
                  I'm not desperate!
                      (then)
                  Why, did I sound desperate?

                  Listen to you -- desperately asking
                  me if you sound desperate.

               Even if it's constructive?

                         MIKE
               Never. Men are incapable of growth,
               change or progress. For men, self-
               improvement ends at toilet-
               training. Rule number two. Laugh at
               whatever he says.

                         ABBY
               What if what he's saying isn't
               funny?

                         MIKE
               That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is
               like a fake orgasm.

                         ABBY
               And a fake orgasm is good?

                         MIKE
               No, but a fake orgasm is better
               than no orgasm at all.

                         ABBY
               A fake orgasm is no orgasm.

                            MIKE
                  Only to you. You're not the only
                  person in the room, you know. Let's
                  not be selfish.

     Abby giggles. Mike is struck by the sound of her laughter.

                            MIKE (CONT"D)
                  That was perfect. You have a
                  perfect laugh. Real or fake?

                            ABBY
                  You'll never know.

     He raises an eyebrow, impressed.

     Mike and Abby wait for their lattes.

                            MIKE
                  Rule number three. Never talk about
                  your problems. Men don't really
                  listen or care.

                            ABBY
                  Some men care.

                            MIKE
                  No. Some men pretend to care. When
                  we ask you how you're doing, it's
                  just guy code for "let me put my
                  dick in your ass."

                            ABBY
                  Okay, I'm trying to decide whether
                  I should just walk away right now,
                  or run.

                            MIKE
                  I know you think Colin is above it
                  all, but he's a guy. If he's even
                  remotely into you, he's thought
                  about each one of your orifices at
                  least ten times.

                            ABBY
                  I love how you assume every man is
                  as perverse as you are.

                            MIKE
                  I don't assume. I know.
                                                                 52.

50   EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    50

     Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.

                          MIKE
               Rule number four. Men are very
               visual. Ninety percent of a
               relationship is based on how good
               the woman looks. We have to change
               your look.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with my look?

                         MIKE
                   (taking her in)
               Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies?
               Nurse shoes?

                          ABBY
               These aren't nurse shoes! They're
               Lady Keds.

                         MIKE
               Abby, you're a very attractive
               woman but you are completely
               inaccessible. You're all about
               comfort and efficiency.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with comfort and
               efficiency?

                         MIKE
               Nothing. Except no one wants to
               fuck it.

     With that, a MONTAGE BEGINS...

51   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                                       51

     Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie.

                         ABBY
               I am not getting breast implants.

                         MIKE
               Size isn't everything. Breasts just
               have to be friendly. They have to
               say, "Hello, everybody! Look at
               me!"

     Abby looks down at her breasts, curiously.

                            MIKE
                  Uh, "I'm reading Tolstoy and I
                  don't want to be disturbed"?

                            ABBY
                  Really? I hate Tolstoy.

     A SALESWOMAN passes them.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Excuse me ma'am, but we need some
                  bras that will make my friend's
                  boobs say, "Put me in your mouth --
                  I taste good."

     The saleswoman looks disturbed, but hands him a push-up water
     bra.

                            SALESWOMAN
                  This should do the trick.

                            MIKE
                  Sweet.
                      (to Abby)
                  Strap it on, flapjacks.

     Abby glares at him as we CUT TO --

                  I look like a hooker.

                            MIKE
                  That's a good thing.

     She falls, KNOCKING OVER a large display of shoes.

                            MIKE (cont'd)
                  Well, you're on your back, so that
                  works.

                      (re her current hairdo)
                  A ponytail implies that you are
                  either operating heavy machinery or
                  emptying the litter box. Neither of
                  these things inspires an erection.

     The hairdresser shoves her head under the sink and douses her
     with water.

     Mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.

                            ABBY (O.S.)
                  I just don't want to be perceived
                  as a bimbo.

                            MIKE
                  I don't want you to be a bimbo. You
                  need to be two people, the saint
                  and the sinner, the librarian and
                  the stripper. It's a delicate
                  balance. On one hand, you have to
                  push the guy away with cold
                  indifference and yet on the other
                  hand be a sexually teasing tornado.

     Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and
     sling backs. Her hair and make-up are sexy but not trashy.

                  Well just don't sit there. Say

                  But I wear contacts. Besides,
                  doesn't the woman usually remove
                  glasses during a makeover?

                             MIKE
                  Yeah, but we're going for a
                  stripper­librarian thing. Right
                  now, I wouldn't trust you to find

               Oh my God!

                         MIKE
               Told you he'd drop by.

                          ABBY
                    (panicking)
               I'm not ready for this. Am I? I'm
               not.

                         MIKE
               Calm down. Keep the conversation
               under a minute. Be mysterious. Keep
               him guessing.

     Mike leaps over the couch and hides. As Abby walks over to
     the door and opens it. Colin stands there.

                            ABBY
               Oh. Hey.

                         COLIN
               Hi. Wow, you look great.

                            ABBY
               Thanks.

                         COLIN
               What happened to you today?

                         ABBY
               What do you mean?

                         COLIN
               You put me on hold and didn't call
               me back.

                         ABBY
               That was you? I'm so sorry.

     She hustles him out the door.

               Bye.

     Colin bangs on the door.

                         COLIN (0.S.)
               Abby wait...

     Mike pops up from under the couch. He gives her the thumbs
     up.

               Do you want to go the Lobos game on
               Saturday?

     She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy
     dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness.

                         MIKE
               What the hell is that?!

     Colin walks with Abby, who adjusts something in her ear. Now
     she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other
     end...

     MIKE'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- A different angle of Abby

                  Just relax. You're gonna be fine.
                  I'll walk you through this.

     Colin looks at Abby and smiles as they take their seats,               *
     popcorn in hand.                                                       *

     We INTERCUT with Mike.

                  There's no right answer to that
                  question. Do something non-
                  committal...

     Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin
     hooks at her, confused.

                            COLIN
                  I'm really more of a fair weather
                  fan myself. I do like watching Mike
                  DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing
                  bone structure.

                               MIKE
                  Laugh.

     Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks
     at her.

                            COLIN
                  What's so funny?

                               ABBY

                            MIKE
                  Shit, he was serious?

     Feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, Abby takes out her              *
     floss.                                                                 *

               guy wants to hear that!

                          ABBY
               No, no, I take full responsibility.
               So...
                   (sticking out her hand)
               ...Thanks.
                   (as he shakes her hand)
               But, hey, at least your pants are
               clean.

     He smiles, amused.

                         COLIN
               You're not what I'm used to.

               Actually, that's a good thing. I'm
               used to women I can figure out in
               five seconds. I can't do that with
               you.

     Mike rolls his eyes.

                         MIKE
               He's an idiot. I figured you out in
               two.

                  ...And walk away.

     She starts to walk away when Colin stops her, grabbing her
     arm and pulling her in for a kiss.

                            COLIN
                  That definitely made up for my wet
                  crotch.

                      (off his look; realizing)
                  Just -- scratch that.

     Colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends
     to enter her house until she sees Colin close his front door.
     Then, she turns around and rushes over to --

     MIKE. She throws her arms around him, embracing him.

                            ABBY
                  You did it! You did it!

     Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.

                             MIKE
                  I didn't do anything. It was you.
                  Don't ask me why, but I think he
                  likes you.

     Abby puts her key in the door.

               I'm going to ignore that because
               I'm in a very good mood.

               Yeah, I heard, wet crotch.

     Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is
     walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking.

59   INT. ELIZABETH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -       NIGHT                59

     Jonah and Mike sit on the couch, playing "Fight Night."

                         JONAH
               So, no date tonight?

                         MIKE
               As a matter of fact, I did have a
               date. It wasn't mine, but it was a
               date. I was helping out a friend.

                         JONAH
               Guy or girl?

                           MIKE

                         JONAH

                  If you know so much about chicks,

     Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her

     A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla
     suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR.
     LESTER.

                            DR. LESTER
                  Of all primates, Bonobos are the
                  closest relatives to human beings,
                  both genetically and socially ­-
                  especially when it comes to sex.
                  For the Bonobo, sex is a way to
                  ease stress and diffuse tensions.

                            MIKE
                  So summing up Bonobo-land, the
                  chicks look great, get freaky in
                  bed and in turn, they get to sit on
                  their asses and boss their men
                  around all day.

                            DR. LESTER
                  That's one way of looking at it.

                            MIKE
                  If that's not an argument for
                  evolution, I don't know what is.

               Well, you need to start. Because if
               you don't want to have sex with
               you, why the hell should Colin?

61   EXT. ABBY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                     61

     Abby opens the door to find a gift bag on her doorstep, with
     a card that reads: "This present isn't for you. It's for your
     bean. Love Mike."
                                                                 71.

62   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           62

     Abby sits on the couch staring at a box of ELECTRIC
     UNDERWEAR.

     She opens the box, dumping out a pair of underwear and a
     REMOTE CONTROL. When she turns on the remote the underwear
     VIBRATES, startling her. She turns it off.

63   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT                               63

     Abby checks herself out in the mirror. Now in the underwear.
     She downs a glass of wine, sits on the bed and picks up the
     remote. She turns it on. Nothing happens. She tries again.
     Nothing.

                            ABBY
               Great.

     Abby smacks the remote a few times. The DOORBELL rings.

                   (shouting)

     Abby quickly throws on her skirt and hurries toward the
     living room.

     Abby heads toward the door, but quickly realizes she's still
     holding the remote. She tosses it in her purse, then opens
     the door.

     Mike stands there out of breath, dressed in a suit.

                         MIKE
               You have to come with me.

                            ABBY
               Where?

                         MIKE

               want to fuck it up.

     Mike pops out from behind Abby.

                  I'm Mike. Change in plans. Grab

     who sits in the back.

                  We'll just stay for one drink. I'm

     As Abby, Mike and Colin walk into the bar, two buxom blonde
     twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike.

                            MIKE
                  Hey, ladies. You're looking quite
                  fetching.

                              BAMBI
                  Hi, Mike!

                            CANDI
                  Do you like my dress?

     She leans over and displays her cleavage.

     She tries to control her displeasure, as Stuart walks in with
     two guys in suits, BOB and HAROLD, in their 50's.

     The group sits down at the table.

                  So, you guys here to give me a
                  raise, or what?

     UNDER THE TABLE

     Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks
     over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for
     her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE
     NEXT TO THEM.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his
     skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks
     it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

     AT ABBY'S TABLE

     As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back.

                            STUART
                  That's my guy. Always with the
                  jokes.

     of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers.

     Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the
     table, clutching her head and looking around frantically,
     trying to figure out who has the remote.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher.

     Abby's eyes roll back. She looks like she's on three hits of
     ecstasy.

                         COLIN
               Are we ready to go?     I know Abby
               is.

     Harold and Bob shake hands with Mike.

                         HAROLD
               Keep up the good work, Mike.

                         BOB
               And thanks for introducing us to
               our future ex-wives.

                         MIKE
               You kids play safe.

     They take off with the twins.     Mike turns to Abby and Colin.

                         MIKE
               So, what's next? A little three-way
               Scrabble? Some Twister? Maybe a
               massage chain? We could write in
               each others' diaries...

                         COLIN
               I think we've got it from here.

     Mike's truck pulls up and he gets in.

                         MIKE
               Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

     He drives away. Abby smiles at Colin, as a punk rock version
     of "Getting To Know You" PLAYS and a MONTAGE BEGINS...

71   EXT. SANDIA MOUNTAIN - DAY                                        71

     Colin and Abby ride the tram up the mountain, snuggling.

     Abby and Colin are watching "TO CATCH A THIEF." Colin puts
     his arm around Abby.

                         COLIN
               I can't believe I've never seen
               this before.

     Abby grins, pleased.

     Mike's on set rehearsing with a HOT GIRL next to him. NEARBY,
     Abby gets flowers delivered. Mike tries not to be distracted
     by Abby's delighted expression as she reads the card.

74   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                            74

     At the counter, Abby introduces Colin to Joy. As Colin turns
     away to get his latte, Joy falls to the ground in a MOCK
     SWOON. Colin sees this and, concerned, rushes to help Joy up.

75   INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT                                           75

     Mike stands at the sports bar with Dwayne, Steve and Gary, as
     a DRUNK GUY praises Mike.

                         DRUNK GUY
                   (to Mike)
               Dude, you got me laid three times
               last month. Drinks are on me.

                         MIKE
               Just doing my job.

     Just then a CUTE BRUNETTE in a tight t-shirt and ridiculously
     gynormous implants walks up.

                         CUTE BRUNETTE
               I got implants, just like you said!

                         MIKE
                   (horrified)
               Indeed you did.

                         DWAYNE
               Here's to implants!

     Steve clinks his beer bottle against Mike's.

                         STEVE
               You're a rock star, bro.

76   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           76

     A waiter takes Colin and Abby's order.

                            WAITER
                  A bottle of water to start?

                            COLIN
                  Yes, a bottle of flat, please.

     She starts to say something, then smiles at the waiter.

                            ABBY
                  I'll have one, too.

     Colin smiles at her as THE MONTAGE ENDS.

     Mike has a beer and enjoys the scenery as Abby sits across
     from him at their table, making notes.

                            ABBY
                  The Balloon Fiesta is coming up,
                  so, I was thinking for sweeps, we
                  could do a segment on "how men are
                  full of hot air."

     He doesn't answer.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  I was kidding --

     Mike isn't even listening. He's watching a trashy redhead at
     the bar. Abby notices.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  Colin would never like a girl like
                  that.

                            MIKE
                  I forgot, Colin only likes "women

                  I didn't say that...

                            ABBY
                  Exactly my point. Man-whores want
                  women who wear slutty clothes and
                  suck lots of cock.

                             MIKE
                  Every man wants that. And for your
                  information, I was only with the
                  one who can read.
                      (then)
                  Did you just say cock?

                            ABBY
                  What? I can say cock. You don't own
                  that word. Cock. There. I said it
                  again.

                             MIKE
                  A week ago you cried at the thought
                  of a vibrator. Now you're all "cock
                  this,""cock that."
                      (then)
                  You had sex with Colin, didn't you?

               So there you have it. Never assume
               a girl is easy, or assume she's a
               prude. There are many layers in
               between and it's your job,
               gentlemen, to peel back those
               layers and figure out exactly what
               type of woman you are dealing with.

     NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby.

                         JOY
               What happened to him? That sounded
               almost enlightened.

     Abby doesn't know weather to be pleased or worried.

                         MIKE
               Because once you do peel back those
               layers, my friends, her lady garden
               awaits. And I'm pretty sure you're
               gonna want to fertilize that patch
               of petunias. And that there is the
               Ugly Truth.

                         JOY
               And -- he's back.

                  three years. Now go.

     A pissed Abby sits in the cab, having a conversation with
     herself.

                            ABBY
                  Hi, stupid motherfucker who'd still
                  be on cable access if it weren't
                  for me. I hear you're moving to
                  NBC.

     The CAB DRIVER looks at her.

                            CAB DRIVER
                  What did you just call me?

                            ABBY
                  Nothing. Just practicing my speech.

     Mike walks out of the lobby, as Abby gets out of a cab,
     suitcase in hand.

                              MIKE
                  Abby?    What are you doing here?

     Abby glares at him, about to show her true feelings, but then
     quickly covers. Smiling.

                  Apparently, he felt that you needed
                  a producer more than I needed to
                  get laid.

85   INT. TOWN CAR - DAY                                               85

     Abby and Mike sit in the backseat.      Abby looks down at her
     notes.

                            ABBY
                  Okay, so let's go over the pre-
                  interview questions.

     Mike studies her.

                            MIKE
                  I'm sorry you didn't get to meet
                  little Colin this weekend. And by
                  little, I don't mean undersized,
                  although I highly suspect that's
                  the case.

                            ABBY
                  Really? Colin's penis? That's what
                  you want to talk about right now? I
                  was thinking maybe we should talk
                  about what you're gonna say on the
                  show.
                      (doing Jay)
                  So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly
                  Truth" start?

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, I had a sales job where
                  I drove around a lot, listening to
                  talk radio. I started calling in
                  and lo and behold, people liked
                  what I had to say. Then I decided
                  what the hell, I need my own show.
                  I have a message people need to
                  hear.

     Abby rolls her eyes, still angry with him.

                            MIKE
                  Excuse me, lady, but you have a
                  boyfriend right now because of me.

                            ABBY
                  It may have started because of you,
                  but it's lasted because of me.

                            MIKE

                  normal control freak psycho self in

                  I'm not a control freak.

                  When you checked into the hotel,
                  did you or did you not insist on
                  getting an "Eastern-facing" room on
                  "a floor not below seven"?

                  view.

                            MIKE
                  My point is, Colin likes the Mike
                  version of Abby, not the Abby
                  version of Abby. So, don't go
                  knocking my words of wisdom when
                  you're living proof that they work.

     Abby sits there, fuming that he's right.

                            ABBY
                  I could be having sex right now --

     A "Tonight Show" handler in a headset readies a visibly
     nervous Mike backstage. Mike's Agent stands next to him,
     giving him a pep talk as Abby watches skeptically.

                  Dude, this is awesome. You're about
                  to go on Leno! NBC is going to give
                  you the moon --

     Mike shoots him a "shut up" look. Abby pretends not to
     notice.

                            AGENT
                  -- in a gift basket, of course.

                  This isn't helping.

                            AGENT
                  Just do what you always do.

                            MIKE
                  What do I always do?

                  That might be the nicest thing
                  you've ever said to me.

                            ABBY
                  Your welcome.

     She smiles at him. Looking a little calmer, he smiles back
     at Abby. The Agent rolls his eyes. The handler gives Mike
     the nod, as we HEAR --

                  So what's your number one piece of
                  advice to all the people out there
                  who are trying to find love?

                            MIKE
                  Don't do it. Try to find lust
                  instead. It's a lot easier and a
                  lot less messy. Blue balls only
                  last a few hours. A broken heart
                  can last years.

     head.

                  The girl who screwed you up. She
                  must have been a doozy.

     Mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly.

                  Like I said, better a floozy than a
                  doozy.

     Abby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction.

                            JAY
                  Well, what do you say to guys like
                  me who have been happily married
                  for twenty-seven years? We can't be
                  the exception to the rule, can we?
                  There's plenty of us out there.

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, let me tell ya --

     He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him
     an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.

                            MIKE
                  Marriage starts off great. She's
                  cute, you're cute, the world's

                  still be on Channel 83. So don't
                  worry, I'm not going anywhere.

                            ABBY
                  Really?

                  Relax. Drink. Enjoy. You did your
                  job. I'm re-signing with you. Now
                  let's stop talking about work.

     Abby sips her mojito, studying Mike.

                            ABBY
                  So...who was the doozy?

                            MIKE
                  What are you, trying to kill my
                  buzz?

                             ABBY
                  No, I'm interested. In what makes
                  you...you.

     Mike sighs, deciding to level with her.

                            MIKE
                  It wasn't just one...it was more
                  like a parade. By the time I hit
                  thirty, I realized you can only
                  have so many bad relationships
                  before you figure out there's no
                  such thing as a good one.

                            ABBY
                  You can't really believe there's no
                  such thing as a good relationship.

                            MIKE
                  To my very core.

     Just then, the waitress walks up.

                            WAITRESS
                  Two more mojitos?

                            ABBY
                  And some water, please.

                            WAITRESS
                  Still or sparkling?

                            MIKE
                  Just bring us tap water.

     She nods and leaves. Abby stares at him.

                         ABBY
               So I've been told.

     He stands up.

                         MIKE
               C'mon, let's dance.

                         ABBY
               I don't think so.

                         MIKE
               I'm serious. I've seen your spazzy
               dance, now I want to see the real
               thing.

     Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst
     dancers are great.

                         ABBY
               I can't dance like that.

                           MIKE
               I can.

     Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto --

91   INT. EL FLORADITA - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                           91

     Mike and Abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor.

                         MIKE
               You'll be fine.

     Abby looks at him, sure that he's about to make a fool of
     them both.

     Then, he takes her in his arms, completely self-assured, and
     starts leading her in a salsa dance and...

     ...he's good. But not just good. Great.

     She follows his moves, half-shocked and half-turned on. He
     pulls her in a bit closer, and for the first time, she allows
     herself to be led without trying to control the situation.

     For about five seconds.          Then she looks at her watch.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  We've got an early flight tomorrow.
                  We should go.

     Mike and Abby ride up the elevator.

                            ABBY
                  So the car's picking us up
                  downstairs at eight. You want me to
                  call you?

                            MIKE
                  I'll get a wake up call.

                               ABBY
                  Good idea.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                            ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I had a great time.

     The elevator comes to a stop.

     They hug. It's long hug. They give a quick kiss.

     Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby.
     And suddenly --

     They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER.

     In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their
     furious groping blocks it, until --

     A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at
     each other.

                            MIKE (cont'd)

     Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked. The
     doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned.

                  I want to do it again?

     There's a KNOCK at the door. She leaps up, smooths her hair,
     checks her reflection, and goes to the door. Opening it with
     a smile, she finds --

     Standing there, bottle of red wine in hand, is... Colin.

                  Since you couldn't come to Santa
                  Fe, I decided to come to you.

                  Well, you told me you were
                  spontaneous. Guess the proof is in
                  the pudding.

                  Sorry, about that. He was upset
                  about his performance on Leno.

                            COLIN
                  No worries. The rest of the night
                  is ours.

     He pours her a glass of wine.

                            COLIN (cont'd)
                  To the first of many romantic
                  evenings to come.

     Abby takes the glass and drinks.      And keeps drinking.

                            COLIN (cont'd)
                  Whoa --

     Abby finishes the glass and looks at him.

                            ABBY
                  Why do you like me?

                  Well, you're beautiful, you're
                  smart --

     Abby smiles, pleased, then he continues...

                            COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  You're open, you laugh at my jokes,
                  you never criticize...

     Abby's smile fades.

                            COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  You never try to control the
                  situation, and I've got to say,
                  it's a breath of fresh air. A lot
                  of women I know are total control
                  freaks -- and it's a nightmare. I
                  love that you're not like that.

     Abby looks at him, nodding, then --

                To be honest, I didn't like the way
                you poured the wine. I would have
                decanted it. And I was editing that
                speech as you were giving it.

                Miss, we're going to need you to

                   closed a deal with him. Corporate's
                   having a shit fit. What the hell

                   so you can learn how to get chicks.
                   Let me assure you, you're in good
                   hands. You're looking at a guy
                   who's personally had sex with over
                   137 women. Most of them conscious.

      Abby looks at Joy, panicked.

                             ABBY
                   He's ad-libbing. Why is he ad-
                   libbing? There's no ad-libbing.

107   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                            107

      Mike sits down on the couch to watch.

                             MIKE
                   Oh, this is beautiful.

      ON TV -- Jack Magnum just makes it worse.

                             JACK MAGNUM (ON T.V.)
                   We're here at the Balloon Fiesta,
                   and I'm supposed to be telling you
                   men are full of hot air, but I
                   think we all know, it's the ladies
                   that are full of crap. Just because
                   she says no, doesn't mean she means
                   no.

      At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon
      basket. After a moment --

      A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

                             ABBY (ON T.V.)
                       (nervous)
                   Hi! I'm sorry, but Jack Magnum will
                   no longer be able to do "The Ugly
                   Truth" segment. Which should really
                   come as no surprise. Because men
                   are completely unreliable.

108   INT. KPHX - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                     108

      Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room, in shock.

                             CLIFF
                   What is she doing?

      The PHONE RINGS. Stuart picks up, then blanches.

                              STUART
                       (into phone)
                   Hey, Harold. Yes, I know -- we're
                   fixing it.

109   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    109

      Abby stands in the basket, still nervous, but flying on
      adrenaline. Joy gives her a "keep going" hand gesture.

                             ABBY
                   Take Mike Alexander, for instance.
                   He up and quit the show without so
                   much as a word. You think you know
                   what men are going to do, you think
                   you know what they want to do...but
                   when it comes down to the moment
                   where they actually have to nut up,
                   they turn around and do something
                   completely different.
                                                                107.

110   INT. MIKE'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                         110

      Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys.

                          MIKE
                Oh, I'm all over this.

      He races out, as Jonah calls after him.

                          JONAH
                I don't think she's into you,guy!

111   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    111

      Joy and the camera guy watch as Abby gains steam, ranting to
      the camera. B-CAMERA, strapped to the basket, also records.

                          ABBY
                The big, strong, romantic men we've
                been reading about in novels and
                watching in movies since we were
                nine? They're fallacies. "Blue
                Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.
                Men are not strong. Men are not
                brave. Men are afraid.

112   INT. KPHX - "SACRAMENTO AM" SET - DAY                            112 *

      From the news desk, Georgia and Larry watch the monitor,
      confused.

                          LARRY
                    (offended)
                I love "Blue Lagoon".

      Georgia squeezes his hand.

                          GEORGIA
                I know you do, honey.

113   EXT. FIELD - PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      113

      Mike's truck careens into the parking lot. He gets out,
      racing towards the field.

114   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    114

      Abby is now on a total tear.

                          ABBY
                ...They're afraid to say what they
                feel. Afraid to grow up. Afraid to
                tell the truth.
                                                                108.

      Jonah watches, entranced.

                          JONAH
                It's like she's in his brain!

116   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    116

      Mike pushes through the crowd of balloon lovers.

117   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    117

      Abby continues her impassioned tirade.

                          ABBY
                Even if they have a moment in a
                hotel elevator that's totally
                romantic and filled with potential,
                men are completely incapable of
                copping to it. Because men are
                weak.

                          MIKE (O.S.)
                Let me tell you something about
                women.

      She turns to see --

      MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the
      balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.

                            ABBY
                Hey --

                          MIKE
                    (ignoring her; to camera)
                Women would have us believe that
                they are the victims. They aren't.
                They want us to think that we break
                their hearts for sport. That's
                crap. They say they want romance.
                They say they want true love, but
                all they want is a checklist. Is he
                perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a
                doctor?

118   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      118

      A confused Cliff looks at Stuart, who's still on the phone.

                          CLIFF
                I thought he quit.

                   See? I told you she'd get him back.

119   EXT. FIELD - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                 119

      Abby glares at Mike.

                             ABBY
                   That is not true.

      BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.

                             JOY
                   Well, kinda true.

      Mike continues his rant.

                             MIKE
                   You men that fit the criteria --
                   don't kid yourselves. They're not
                   sleeping with you. They're sleeping
                   with a carefully calculated set of
                   venal choices. Money over
                   substance. Looks over soul. Polish
                   over principles. No gesture, no
                   matter how real or romantic, will
                   ever compensate for a really
                   impressive list of credentials.

                             ABBY
                   Says the man who's never made a
                   gesture except for this one --

      She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

                             MIKE
                   So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?

                             ABBY
                   The elevator was a moment of
                   passion, followed by a moment of
                   panic on your part, apparently.

120   INT. KPHX - CONTROL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                   120

      Stuart looks at Cliff.

                             STUART
                   What elevator?
                                                             110.

      Mike glares at Abby.

                          MIKE
                I came by your room!

                          ABBY
                And then you ran away.

                          MIKE
                Well, that wasn't panic,
                sweetheart. It was an unwillingness
                to compete with the walking
                checklist that was in your bed. You
                should be thanking me.

      NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.

                          JOY
                We have ten seconds.

      An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.

                          PILOT
                Are we ready to soar up, up and
                away?

      IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera.

                          MIKE
                And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A
                girl in heat for two guys will
                always pick the one with the better
                resume.

      BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon.

                          ABBY
                That is bullsh --

      The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC
      violation.

      The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to
      rise.

                          JOY
                ...And we're out.

      Abby glares at Mike, not realizing they're still on the air.

                          ABBY
                    (freaked)
                I hate you so much I just swore on
                live television.

                          MIKE
                No, you hate yourself for being so
                shallow.

                             PILOT
                Off we go!

      Abby and Mike spin around to look at him.       Realizing the
      balloon is now soaring upwards.

                          ABBY
                Where are we going?!

                          MIKE
                I'm not going anywhere with you.

      Mike starts to climb out.

                          ABBY
                What a shock. You're bailing.

                          PILOT
                I wouldn't recommend that...

      Mike looks down to see --

      They are now FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. And rising.         He
      stops climbing, as the balloon continues to float up and
      away.

                          PILOT (cont'd)
                So, who wants champagne?

      Now holding champagne glasses, a disgusted Mike and Abby look
      at opposite ends of the sky, hating that they are trapped
      together.

                          MIKE
                Hey! I know -- we can pass the time
                with you telling me how much fun
                you and Colin had having sex in Los
                Angeles.

                          ABBY
                I broke up with Colin in Los
                Angeles, jackass.

      Mike is thrown, turning to look at her.

                            MIKE
                What?

                          PILOT
                To our left, we have the Sandia
                Mountains, glistening in the
                afternoon twilight...

      Abby ignores the pilot.

                          ABBY
                Oh, that got your interest? If you
                think we're going to finish what we
                started in LA, you're out of your
                mind. You lost your chance.

                          PILOT
                And to our right, you'll see the
                Rio Grande River winding its way
                through the diochramatic
                landscape...

      Mike ignores the pilot as well.

                          MIKE
                I never had a chance with you.

                          PILOT

                   You're right. I had a momentary
                   lapse in judgement where I thought
                   you might be more than you are. But
                   you aren't. Clearly.

                             MIKE

                   Yeah, it is "scary." It's fucking
                   terrifying. Especially because I'm
                   in love with a psycho like you.

      Abby stares at Mike.

                          ABBY
                I am not a psycho.

                          MIKE
                I just told you I loved you and all
                you heard was "psycho". You are the
                definition of neurotic.

                           ABBY
                The definition of neurotic is a
                person who suffers from anxiety,
                obsessional thoughts, compulsive
                acts and physical ailments without
                having any objective evidence of
                disease --

                          MIKE
                Again, I just told you I'm in love
                with you and you're standing here
                giving me a vocabulary lesson.
                    (to the Pilot)
                Back me up on this, buddy...who
                here is afraid?

                You're in love with me.      Really.
                Why?

                          MIKE
                Beats the shit out of me, but I am.

      Abby opens her mouth, about to make a retort, then realizes
      what's been said to her. For the first time in her life, she
      stops thinking and --

      Grabs Mike and kisses the hell out of him. The sheer force of
      her kissing THROWS them into the pilot, causing --

      The torch to FLAME radically.

      The balloon WHOOSHES upwards.

      Abby finally loosens her grip on Mike. Hair askew, he looks a
      little like he's been hit by a cyclone.

                          ABBY
                    (breathless)
                If you say "just kidding", I'm
                going to throw you out of this
                balloon and watch your body
                splatter to the ground.

                          MIKE
                Are you going to threaten me with
                death when we have sex? Because it
                might be distracting.

      The Pilot looks worried for his safety.

                          PILOT
                May I suggest you wait until we
                land?

      Abby and Mike keep kissing as the balloon sails into the

                   As many of you know, sometimes a
                   guy's gotta admit what he thought
                   was the truth isn't necessarily the
                   whole truth. Yes, women have a
                   checklist, but sometimes that list
                   includes a foul-mouthed idiot who
                   took way too long to realize he was
                   in love.
                       (holds up a finger)
                   Let's continue this conversation in
                   a second.

      WE PULL BACK to REVEAL --

      Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of WEDDING
      GUESTS seated behind him. An altar with flowers and a
      minister wait patiently.

      Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his
      way up to the altar.

      As he arrives he greets his groomsman, JONAH, also wearing a
      tux. He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid.

                             JONAH
                       (to Joy)
                   Has anyone ever told you you have a
                   stupendous bosom?

                             JOY
                   Not lately, so feel free to say it
                   again.

      A string quartet's version of "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" begins,
      as we PAN OVER to see --

      ABBY, in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle.
      Looking absolutely beautiful.

                             MIKE
                       (wowed; to camera)
                   Zoom in on this, guys. I want the
                   whole city to see how lucky I am.

      The cameraman ZOOMS IN on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and
      smiles.

      IN THE AUDIENCE, Elizabeth takes photo after photo. Her date
      -- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused.

      AT THE ALTAR, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike.

                    (re the cameras)
                What's this?

                No, what's Jorge doing so close?
                We need a master.

                    (surprised)
                You knew about this?

                Hello...I'm the producer. It's
                sweeps week. How do you think I
                got them to pay for this?

      She gestures to -- BOB and HAROLD from Corporate, who sit in
      the audience.

      Mike looks momentarily surprised, then --

                          MIKE
                God, I love you.

      He turns to the camera.

                          MIKE
                So, here it is, guys. The games,
                the manipulation, the ploys, the
                tactics... all the things we do to
                think we're in control. But guess
                what? We never are.
