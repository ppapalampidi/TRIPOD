            here.

            like you to take him around the
            place as soon as we are through.

                         WATSON
            Fine.

            What line of work are you in now?

                         JACK
            I'm a writer um... Teaching has
            been more or less a way of making
            ends meet.

            Well, I'm looking for a change.

                         ULLMAN (OFF)
            Our people in Denver recommended
            Jack very highly, and, for once, I
            agree with them.

                         ULLMAN
            Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I
            was about to explain that eh... our
            season here runs from oh May 15th
            to October 30th and then we close
            down completely until the following
            May.

            Do you mind if I ask why you do
            that?  It seems to me that the
            skiing up here would be fantastic.

                         ULLMAN (OFF)
            Oh, it sure would be

M.S. ULLMAN

                         ULLMAN (CONT'D)
            but the problem is the enormous
            cost it would be to keep the road
            to the Sidewinder open.  It's a...
            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
            gets an average of 20 feet of snow
            during the winter, and there's just
            no way to make it economically
            feasible to keep it clear.  When
            the place was built in 1907, there
            was very little interest in winter
            sports, and this site was chosen
            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.

            Well, it's certainly got plenty of
            that.

JACK laughs.

                         ULLMAN
            That's right.  And did they give
            you any idea in Denver about what
            the job entails?

                                                            8.


                         JACK
            Only in a very general way.

                         ULLMAN
            Well...

            ...the winters can be fantastically
            cruel, and the basic idea is
            to...to cope with the very costly
            damage and depreciation which can
            occur.  And this consists mainly of
            running the boiler, heating
            different parts of the hotel on a
            daily rotating basis, repairing
            damage as it occurs and doing
            repairs, so that the elements can't
            get a foothold.

            Physically, it's not a very
            demanding job.  The only thing that
            can get a bit trying up here during
            the winter is eh... the tremendous
            sense of isolation.

            five months of peace is just what I

            hired a man named Charles Grady, as
            the winter caretaker.  He came up
            here with his wife and two little
            girls of about eight or ten.  And
            he had a good employment record,
            good references and from what I've
            been told, I mean, he seemed like a
            completely normal individual.  But
            at some point during the winter, he
            must have suffered some kind of a
            complete mental breakdown.

            Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you
            have anything to worry about.  I'm
            quite sure there is nothing
            physically wrong with Danny.

            absolutely fine now, but you should
            have seen him.

                         DOCTOR
            Oh I know.  Kids can scare you to
            death, but believe me these episodes
            are not at all uncommon, and they
            look much worse than they are.

                         DOCTOR
            Mrs. Torrance, most of the time
            these episodes with kids are never
            explained.  They are brought on by
            emotional factors, and they rarely
            occur again.

            They're more akin to auto-hypnosis,
            a kind of self induced trance.  If
            it re-occurs which I doubt

            so we kept him out for a while,
            and, yeah, I...I guess that's about
            the time when I first noticed that

            Well it's just one of those things.
            You know... purely an accident, um.
            My husband had oh... been drinking,
            and he came home about three hours
            late, so he wasn't exactly in the
            greatest mood that night.  And well
            Danny had scattered some of his
            school papers all over the room...
            and my husband grabbed his arm, you
            know, and pulled him away from them.
            It's...it's just the sort of thing
            you do a hundred times with a
            child - you know, in a park or on
            the streets - but on this particular
            occasion my husband just... used
            too much strength and he injured
            Danny's arm.

            Yes, very cosy for a family, and if
            you feel like spreading out you
            have the rest of the hotel to move

                         ULLMAN
            This is our famous hedge maze.
            It's quite an attraction around
            here.  The walls are thirteen feet
            high and the hedges are about as
            old as the hotel itself.  It's a
            lot of fun,

They walk from end of Maze towards Hotel in b.g.

                         ULLMAN (CONT'D)

                         ULLMAN
            Ah... construction started in 1907.
            It was finished in 1909.  The site
            is supposed to be located on an
            Indian burial ground, and I believe
            they actually had to repel a few
            Indian attacks as they were building
            it.

ULLMAN points to red Snowcat at entrance of garage.

                         ULLMAN
            That's our Snowcat.  Can you both
            drive a car?

                         JACK & WENDY
                   (together)
            Yes.

They walk towards SNOWCAT.

                         ULLMAN
            That's fine because basically the
            Snowcat operates very much like a
            car and it won't take you long to
            get the hang of it.

            just last year to refurbish this

                         WENDY

            I'm afraid you're not going to do
            too well here unless you've brought
            your own supplies.  We always

            No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just

            some don't.  I guess you could say
            the Overlook Hotel here has
            something about it that's like
            shining.

            is ready.

                         JACK
            What time is it?

                         WENDY
            It's about eleven thirty.

CAMERA TRACKS FORWARD to JACK & WENDY reflected in mirror.

            Eleven thirty - Jesus!

                         WENDY
            I guess we've been staying up too
            late.

                         JACK
            I know it.

JACK sticks his tongue out.  WENDY picks up plate and glass
of orange juice.

                         WENDY
            I made 'em just the way you like
            'em, sunny side up.

                         JACK
            Hmm, nice.

WENDY walks forward to JACK and puts plate down cam.L.  She
hands him glass of orange juice and he drinks it.

                                                           47.


                         WENDY
            It's really pretty outside.  How
            about taking me for a walk after
            you've finished your breakfast?

                         JACK
            Oh I suppose I oughta try to do
            some writing first.

He puts empty glass down cam.L and picks up plate of eggs
and bacon.

                         WENDY
            Any ideas yet?

                         JACK
            Lots of ideas.  No good ones.

WENDY sits down cam.R.

                         WENDY
            Well, something'll come.  It's just
            a matter of settling back into the
            habit of writing every day.

                         JACK
            Yeah... that's all it is.

JACK starts to eat bacon.

                         WENDY
            It's really nice up here, isn't it?

                         JACK
            I love it.  I really do.  I've
            never been this happy, or
            comfortable anywhere.

            get used to such a big place.  I
            tell you, when we first came up
            here, I thought it was kinda scarey.

WENDY laughs.

                         JACK
            I fell in love with it right away.
            When I came up here from my
            interview, it was as though I had
            been here before.  We...we all have
            moments of deja vu, but this was
            ridiculous.  It was almost as
            though I knew what was going to be
            around every corner.  Ooohhhhh...

WENDY laughs.

            you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a

            It could have happened to anybody.

He raps on counter with hand.

            The little fucker had thrown all my

            Mr. Grady, you were the caretaker
            here.  I recognize you.  I saw your
            picture in the newspapers.  You
            eh... chopped your wife and
            daughters up into little bits, and
            eh... and you blew your brains out.

            they are.
