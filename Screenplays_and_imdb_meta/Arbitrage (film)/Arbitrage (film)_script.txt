          Over CREDITS we HEAR:
                         
           MARIA (O.S.)
           ...but you took a huge bet on the
           housing crisis in the middle of the
           biggest boom anybody'd ever seen. Why?
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           I'm a child of the 50's. My father
           welded steel for the Navy. And my
           mother worked at the VA.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - DAY 1
                         
          As the conversation continues we see:
                         
          1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany
          table.
                         
          2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting
          room.
                         
          3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long
          winding staircase.
                         
                          ROBERT
           They lived through the Depression,
           Pearl Harbor, and the Bomb. And they
           didn't think bad things might
           happen; they knew they would happen.
                         
                          MARIA
           Is that what's happening now?
                         
                          ROBERT
           When I was a kid my favorite
           teacher was Mr. James. Mr. James
           said that world events always
           revolve around five things:
           (extending his fingers one-
                          BY-ONE)
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 2
                         
          And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER
          (60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a
          CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a
          nearby MONITOR.
                         
                          ROBERT
           M-O-N-E-Y.

                          MARIA
                          (LAUGHING)
           Was this freshman econ?
                         
                          ROBERT
           This was fifth-grade econ.
           (smiles, off her laugh)
           But this is something we've seen
           over and over again, time and time
           again, that competition for this--
           limited amount of dollars out
           there, can make even the best of us
           manic. So it's not surprising that
           we see these asset bubbles, but
           when reality sets in of course,
           they burst.
                         
          CUT TO BLACK.

          CLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A:
                         
          FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH
                         
          And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine,
          as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing...
                         
                         
          INT. FALCON 3
                         
          A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas.
                         
          At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed
          tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper.
                         
          In the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it
                         BACK TO
                         
                         ROBERT
                         
          who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit,
          scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT
          DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all-
          commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man.
                         
                          GAVIN
           (handing him the coffee)
           Here you go...
                         
          Robert sips it.

                          GAVIN (CONT'D)
                          (SITTING)
           You're disappointed.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Quants? Derivatives structures?
           What was that about?
                         
                          GAVIN
           It makes no sense.
                         
                          ROBERT
           That's what you said last week.
           Why'd we go down there?
                         
                          GAVIN
           To sign.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And did we sign?
                         
                          GAVIN
           No.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No. We did not. Instead I fly two
           thousand miles for a marketing
           meeting... And where was Mayfield?
           What was this "emergency"? What was
           that about?
                         
                          GAVIN
           (after a beat)
           Did you speak to the auditors?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Why?
                         
                          GAVIN
           What if... we don't don't close this
           week...
                         
          We push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what
          this would mean.
                         
                         
          EXT. WESTCHESTER AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER 4
                         
          The ROAR of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass.
                         
                         
          EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 5
                         
          Robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac,
          followed by Gavin and the aides.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 4.
                         
          They approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file
          BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads
          them into the trunk.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS 6
                         
          The blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and
          towards the city and Park Avenue and finally approaches
                         
                         
          EXT. GRACIE SQUARE - ROBERT'S MANSION - CONTINUOUS 7
                         
          An enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed
          red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined.
          Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS 8
                         
          It's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't
          disappoint. It's an 1850's Tudor given a full once-over,
          maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist
          flair. It actually works.
                         
          A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters,
          handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.
                         
          We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN
          laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement
          and anticipation.
                         
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 9
                         
          A party in progress, dinner already served.
                         
          Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's
          wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's
          son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and
          THREE GRANDCHILDREN.
                         
          Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (LIGHTING UP)
           Look, your grandfather's here!
                         
          The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the
          table, hugging them all.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hi, guys!
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 5.
                         
                          GRANDCHILD
           Hi Grampi! What did you bring us?
                         
          Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a
          frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to
          Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.
                         
          They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast
          to his behavior towards their kids.
                         
                          BROOKE
           It's your birthday, Dad, not theirs.
           You're spoiling them rotten.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (GRINNING)
           It's my job! It's my job. You guys
           turned out fine!
                         
                          BROOKE
                          (HALF-SMILE)
           Debatable.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (to Peter, as they hug and
                          SMILE)
           How you doin', son? Good?
                         
          Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as
          she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.
                         
                          ELLEN
           We had to eat. The kids were
           starving...
                         
                          ROBERT
           (hugging her, happy)
           No, no that's okay. Where's my
           drink, is this mine, here?
                         
          Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday
          candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.
                         
                          ALL
           HEY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! YAY!
                         
          Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a
          toast.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Thank you, thank you, thank you all
           very much, it's such a surprise, I
           didn't even know it was my birthday!
                         
          Everyone laughs a little.

                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           What did Mark Twain say about? He
           said-- old age... is clearly a case
           of mind over matter. If you don't
           mind, it doesn't matter.
                          (MORE LAUGHTER)
           I've done a lot of things in my life,
           worked very hard, but being here,
           looking around-- at all these shining,
           radiant faces, I know that my best
           work is right here in this room, right
           now... I'm deeply proud of all of you.
           That's the best gift your mother and I
           could have hoped for,
                          (KISSES ELLEN)
           so, thank you...
                         
                          PETER
                          (CALLING OUT)
           ...and to have sold the company
           to Standard this morning!
                         
          They all LAUGH.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SMILES)
           That, too, Peter, but- no business
           tonight-- no business!
                         
                          ELLEN
           Oh, here we go!
                         
          More group LAUGHTER.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Although your one-track mind assures
           me you've got not only your mother's
           genes, but you've got mine, too!
                         
          More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter
          across the room.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, I'm aware that may seem
           uncharacteristic, but maybe it's taken me
           sixty years to realize what's truly
           important -- and it's you guys so thank
           you all very much.
                         
                          ALL
           (as they applaud)

          INT. STUDY - MOMENTS LATER 10
                         
          A warm, clubby room, kept traditional. Robert pours out two
          SCOTCHES.
                         
                          ROBERT

           I don't know about me as a mom.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, no no, you should have-- I want
           more "you's" around.
                         
          Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests
          with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.
                         
                          BROOKE
                          (LAUGHS)

           Four... and nineteen.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, yeah yeah...
                         
          Brooke nods, tries to smile.
                         
                          BROOKE
           So what was that all about?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          BROOKE
           The last time you made a speech like that
           we lost the Firestone bid.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS)
           Yeah, well... I just... wanted it
           to be about the family tonight.
                         
          She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.
                         
                          BROOKE
           You see this?
                         
          He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story:

           (shakes his head)
           Yeah... Oy. You know how I feel
           about that. Trash can.
                         
                          BROOKE
           Peter's got a copy pinned up in the

                          ROBERT
           (sits back, takes a drink)
           Well, you gonna keep skirting around it?
                         
          Brooke leans back and stares at him.
                         
                          BROOKE
           Why sell our company? We make a
           great return, we give money to the
           causes we believe in...
                         
                          ROBERT
           My darling, you are still in your 20's.
           I am 60. That's a big difference in
           point of view.
                         
                          BROOKE
           Dad, you're not that old.

                          (LAUGHS)
           It catches up alright. And maybe
           there's some other things I'd like to
           do. Maybe I would like to spend a
           little more time with you guys...
           outside the office.
                         
          Brooke shoots him a look.

                          (GROWING IMPATIENT)
           What?
                         
          Staring at him, then
                         
                          BROOKE
                          (LAUGHS)

          INT. ENTRY HALL - LATER 11
                         
          Ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds
          down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.

                          ELLEN
           Where are you going?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Office.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Now?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah I gotta finish up that thing.
                         
          She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (SMILES)
           But, I haven't given you your
           birthday present yet...
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SMILING BACK)
           I'll be back as soon as I can.
                         
          He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.
          Hold on her.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT 12
                         
          A TAXI stops in front of a large frosted-glass apartment
          entrance. Robert exits, paying the DRIVER through the window.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (into his phone)
           Yeah, Gavin, it's me, uhh... When
           you get this -- I want you to call
           Chris Vogler at Fremaut, tell him I
           need to see him right away, okay?
                         
                         
          INT. LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT 13
                         
          JULIE CÔTE (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the
          exquisite space. It's the modern mirror of Robert's mansion,
          the lines carried through fully this time. And Julie is the
          modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.
                         
          She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack
          of INVITATIONS for the "Julie Côte Gallery - Paintings by Victor
          Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE.
          She's got a seating chart out that she's working on.
                         
          The INTERCOM RINGS. Julie heads over, sees Robert's face on
          the VIDEO MONITOR. She holds a beat.

          EXT. LOFT APARTMENT - SAME 14
                         
          Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie
          watches him from inside the loft, not moving.
                         
          After a second, the door BUZZES open.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAME 15
                         
          Robert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing.
          She's arranging 4 POLAROIDS of different paintings on a wall,
          along with a SEATING CHART. He walks down the long hall.
                         
          He comes up behind her, running his arms across her stomach.
                         
                          JULIE
           (standing in frustration)
           Okay...
                         
          She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine,
          lights a cigarette. Robert trails.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm
           late. I'm always late-- you know
           that-- and I'm sorry. And I'm
           always saying I'm sorry about being
           late.
           (crosses to her)
           It doesn't mean I wouldn't rather
           be here with you.
                         
          They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then
          stubs it out. He gestures to the dining table.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           The show's gonna be beautiful.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (FINALLY--)
           You gonna be there?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (slight beat, then
                          DEFINITIVE)
           I will be there.
                         
          She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge
          and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (LAUGHING)
           Oh wow, that's great.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 11.
                         
                          JULIE
           I made this for you.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You made this? This is amazing. One
           candle, thank you very...
                         
          She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her
          hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE.
                         
          The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they
          kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes
          him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.
                         
                         
          INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY 16
                         
          Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate
          18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark
          contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking
          British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive
          glass conference room. They arrive at
                         
                         
          INT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME 17
                         
          The receptionist escorts Robert in. Standing to greet him is
          JEFFREY GREENBERG (53), handsome and charming.
                         
                          JEFFREY
           Thank you, Diane.
                         
          She exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence.
                         
                          JEFFREY (CONT'D)
           So?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm here.
                         
                          JEFFREY
           Guess what's not?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Jeffrey, I told you, I'm...
                         
                          JEFFREY
           "...working on it," yeah. Well, while
           you're doing that, lemme tell you what's
           not working...
                         
                          ROBERT

                          (LOUDER)
           ...what's not working is my four
           hundred twelve million dollars that's
           sitting in your account so you can
           pass your audit, the four hundred
           twelve million that you needed, you
           said, for two weeks, and which has
           been languishing now for
           (looks down at paper)
           thirty-two days, while it could be
           elsewhere invested, earning an actual
           return, instead of couching the absurd
           lie that you're spinning.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What do you want me to say?
                         
                          JEFFREY
           That you're gonna get a signature
           from Mayfield, and that my hostage
           money and my fee are going to be sent
           to me promptly, say... by tomorrow?
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I am solving the problem. I am getting
           you your money and your fee. You will
           have them very shortly.
                         
                          JEFFREY
           When?
                         
                          ROBERT
           As soon as they sign the contract.
                         
                          JEFFREY
                          (BEAT)
           You know, I'm not the one with the
           liability, pal. I just made a loan.
           You're looking at jail for a
           thousand years for fraudulent
           conveyance and...
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...Stop it! You don't have to talk
           to me like that!...
                         
                          JEFFREY
           I didn't get you into this mess!
                         
                          ROBERT
           You were a friend of mine!...

                          JEFFREY
           ...remember when you asked me if it
           was a good idea to divert half your
           liquid assets into a fucking copper
           mine? What did I tell you?

           Are we done here? I think we're
           done here.
                         
          Jeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment, then
          appears to reach some sort of conclusion.

                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           You can't do that...
                         
                          JEFFREY
           ...the fuck I can't, it's in an escrow bill

                          ROBERT
           ...I need the money there until they
           sign, Jeffrey. What if they check again?
                         
                          JEFFREY
           That's really not my problem, is it?
                         
                          ROBERT

          His phone VIBRATES a TEXT, from Julie: "See you at 8!" He
          stares at it, breathes in deeply.

                          ROBERT
           Is this too blue?
                         
                          ELLEN
           It's the third one you've tried.
                         
          She finishes tying it. He looks in the mirror.

           Ay, yay yay. I look old.
                         
                          ELLEN
           You look regal, and wise, and granted
           a little worried. What is going on?
           Are you afraid of this meeting?

           They haven't signed the papers.

           (rubbing his eyes)
           So did I, but for some reason
           they're stalling. I didn't get any
           sleep on the plane and...
                         
                          ELLEN
           Now come on. It will all work out.
           Just follow the plan.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What plan is that?

                          ELLEN
           They're your words, actually.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Then you married an idiot.

                          (BEAT)
           Okay, but I was thinking, idiot,
           that, after the deal is done, which
           it definitely will be, why don't we
           just take off? Pete's in the best
           place he's ever been, your daughter
           is always as brilliant, right? So,
           I wanna have some fun. I wanna have
           fun with you!

           Let's go to Ravello- the house there.
           We haven't been there forever..

                          ELLEN
           We have to make time. We go for a
           year. Let's take a year and get fat
           and have fun and go on an adventure. I
           mean-- seriously-- how much money do
           we need?. Do you wanna be the richest

          As Brooke catches up with her father in the hallway.
                         
                          BROOKE
           Did you get my message?

           No. What's up?
                         
                          BROOKE
           We need to sit down.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What is it?
                         
                          BROOKE
           I don't want to talk about it here.

           What kind of entries?

           Yeah.

           See if you can find out what
           happened to Mayfield.
                         
          26 She nods, as Robert dashes down the hall. 26

           Robert exits his MAYBACH in front of a big scene in progress:
           trendy FOLKS overflowing into the street, cameras FLASHING...
                         
                         
           INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS 26
                         
           The space is cavernous, modern luxe -- a Liagre design with
           thirty-foot columns and slab granite. The ART COLLECTION on
           display is indeed beautiful- photo-realist paintings -- and
           each one tells a strange story.
                         
           Robert enters and scans the room. No Julie. He approaches the
           gallery ASSISTANT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           How're they doing?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Great. Everyone loves them.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, but how are they doing?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           So-so.
                         
           He scans the party further. No Julie.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Where's Julie?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           She's in the back.
                         
                         
           INT. GALLERY - OFFICE IN BACK - CONTINUOUS 27
                         
           We pick up on Julie bumping two rails of COCAINE.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 21.
                         
          She's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair
          coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything,
          we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world
          success.
                         
          Julie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main
          gallery...
                         
                         
          INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS 28
                         
          Where she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the
          crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office...
                         
          But she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her.
                         
          She stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly:
          "Go away."
                         
          She turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS,
          including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING
          YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her?
                         
          Robert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie.
          She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him.
          He stands there, until--
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hey, Julie.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh...
           (to the group)
           This is Robert Miller, one of our
           collectors. This Katrina Stanton, and
           Alex Stanton and their daughter Ava,
           who is a talented young artist.
                         
          Robert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries,
          especially kind to young AVA (15).
                         
                          ROBERT
           Oh, really? Painter?
                         
                          AVA
           Drawings.
                         
          Julie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LOOKING AROUND)
           Yeah, that's great.
           (as he notices Julie
           leave, to the group)
                          (MORE)
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 22.
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           I like the size of the paintings, I wanna talk
           to you about them in a second.
                         
          Robert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out
          to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           What? Why are you doing this?
                         
                          JULIE
           Go -- away.
                         
          Julie heads back to the buyers.
                         
          Dismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out
          towards the entry desk.
                         
          He approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier
          and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I will take
                          (POINTING)
           those two. And the Rubik's cube on
           the back wall.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           (pointing to list)
           Right there, number seven.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Don't tell her it was me.
           (off her nod)
           I mean it.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           You got it.
                         
          Robert walks out and hails his driver.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER 29
                         
          Off Robert, in bed with Ellen who is asleep. He gets up and
          stumbles to the bathroom, puts on a robe.
                         
                         
          INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR 30
                         
          He approaches the basement level carrying a folder of
          papers...
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 23.
                         
          INT. SERVICE KITCHEN 31
                         
          And sits at the counter, staring at a REPORT of some kind. He
          refills a glass of SCOTCH, downs it.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - NIGHT 32
                         
          Julie's a touch worn from the evening, but she's still
          composed. She sits with five guests including her gallery
          assistant, the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN from earlier, TWO WOMEN,
          and TWO GUYS who look like painters. One does a line of
          COCAINE off a "Fantom" magazine.
                         
                          PAINTER
           ...fucking Dalwood wouldn't know a Van
           Gogh from a Van Eyck. And they call it
           a "State of Contemporism..."
                         
          Julie's phone RINGS. She looks at the Caller-ID, (which shows
          her home line calling) confused.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Who's this?
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           It's me.
                         
                          JULIE
           What do you want?
                         
           ROBERT (O.S.)
           I'm here.
                         
                          JULIE
           Where?
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM 33
                         
          Robert watches Julie through a crack in the doorway. He's on
          her CORDLESS phone. We INTERCUT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm in your bedroom. Can you get
           those people out of here?
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you serious?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Look down the hall. Do you see me?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 24.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (LOOKING)
           I see you.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Okay, so I'm serious.
                         
          She hangs up and begins to clear out the guests.
                         
          Robert sits, unbuttoning his collar.
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - LIVING ROOM 34
                         
          The guests finally leave. Julie heads to the bedroom...
                         
                         
          INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM 35
                         
          And finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.
                         
                          JULIE
           You just come in and out whenever
           you want?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I thought we should talk...
                         
                          JULIE
           (laughs, then in a rage)
           One damn night in a month I told
           you was important to me, et tu es
           meme pas capable d'etre la...
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...I was working, do you
           understand? I'm under enormous
           pressure, I have obligations...
                         
                          JULIE
           ...I don't want to hear about your
           obligations. If you cared -- YOU
           WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE!
                         
                          ROBERT
           I was there! I was there! I was
           late, but I was there. And I'm
           here now.
                         
                          JULIE
           No, no, no. You're here when it's
           convenient for you to be here.
           C'est pas ca l'amour. Love means
           YOU FUCKING SHOW UP!
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 25.
                         
          She walks off into the
                         
                         LIVING ROOM
                         
          Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she
          downs a red wine.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          JULIE
           Why did you buy those paintings?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Because I liked them.
                         
          Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and
          her anger.
                         
                          JULIE
           Okay, thank you for helping me get
           started. But if I'm gonna fail--
           then let me fail!
                         
                          ROBERT
           Julie, you're not gonna fail. Why
           would you fail?
                         
          He crosses towards her.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           You know, I'm not the kinda guy who
           wants to throw money away but if
           you wanna start a business, you
           have to project a certain image.
                         
                          JULIE
           What image?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Success.
                         
          He sits down next to her.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           The market's a disaster right now;
           nobody's moving anything. That's
           why you gotta show sales. People
           look at you then and they say
           "Whoah, how'd she do that?" -- and
           that's what they remember. Always.
                         
          She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...

                          JULIE
                          (QUIETLY)
           You're never gonna leave her.
                         
          Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
                         BEDROOM
                         
          Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.
                         
          Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Come away with me. Let's just take
           your car and go...
                         
                          JULIE
           ...Where?...
                         
                          ROBERT
           There's a place upstate. Very
           beautiful, on the water. We can
           wake up there together- just you
           and me. I'd like that.
                         
          She's keeps crying, but...
                         
                          JULIE
           Me, too.
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT 36
                         
          A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards
          Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More
          Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie
          rests her head on Robert's shoulder.
                         
          And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled
          next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into
          tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's
          respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off
          into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...
                         
          A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to
                         
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY 37
                         
          Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where
          the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,
          flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

          INT. CAR 38
                         
          Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly
          injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement
          returns...
                         
          He looks over at Julie.
                         
          It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly
          decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck.
                         
          Shock, followed quickly by panic.
                         
          We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak...
                         
          Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at
          the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up.
                         
          He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT 39
                         
          He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still
          rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP
          BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.
                         
          He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger
          side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to
          touch her, then stops.
                         
          Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in
          his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.
                         
          Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIELDS - DEAD OF NIGHT 40
                         
          Robert walks and walks through tall grass.
                         
          In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the
          sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating
          the car and its contents.

          Robert cleans himself up in the sink, applying soap and water
          to his cut stomach, scrubbing frantically, He takes all the
          paper towels and puts them in his pocket.

          Robert picks up a PAYPHONE by the bathrooms, cradling it to
          his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger
          through his shirt fiber.
                         
                          ROBERT

          EXT. CAR WRECKAGE SITE 43
                         
          POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred
          CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble.
                         
          DET. MICHAEL BRYER (43) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup
          of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a
          bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS.
                         
          MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking
          his head. Bryer gets out of the car.
                         
                          BRYER
           You gotta be fucking kidding me.
                         
                          MILLS

           I'm not so sure about this...
                         
          Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued.
                         
          Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side.
                         
                          MILLS (CONT'D)

           were down there.
                         
          Bryer immediately sees what he means-- dented metal, even in
          the burnt door.
                         
                          BRYER
           ... So who kicked out the door?
                         
          Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side,
          looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just
          moments before.

          About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting.
          Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.

           Let's go.
                         
          They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty
          banged up.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You gonna tell me what this is?
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's better you don't ask.
                         
                          JIMMY
           So all you're sayin' is, you need a
           ride somewhere.

          That's correct.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Because I want to be very clear
          about this: you called me to give
          you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.
                         
                          ROBERT
          No, you're not. We're not here.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?
                         
                          ROBERT
          We're both alseep right now. At

          Right.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Because if anyone checks...
                         
                          JIMMY
          Why is anyone gonna check?
                         
                          ROBERT
          They're not, as long as we're not here.
          Anybody know you're here?
                         
                          JIMMY
          No.
                         
                          ROBERT

          No!
                         
                          ROBERT
          But somebody knows-- you're not there.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Well, my girl...

          A beat.

           Do you trust her?

           Is this the kinda shit you used to

           Yes, I fucking trust her!

           Good. So you're at home, and I'm at
           home. My wife gets up at five am for
           Pilates -- I will be there next to

           This is some pretty fucked up shit.

           Jimmy...
                         
                          JIMMY
           No, man, come on, I don't hear from
           you since the fuckin' funeral, you
           call me up out of the blue, using
           my father's name, ask me...
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...what do you want, you want
           money? I will give you five
           thousand dollars! I will give you
           ten thousand dollars! I'll give you
           whatever you fuckin'...
                         
          Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.

                          JIMMY
           You wanna talk to me like that you
           can get the fuck outta my car and
           you can walk! You want that?! You
           wanna fuckin' walk home?!
                         
                          ROBERT
           (after a beat)
           Listen... I'm sorry. I'm not
           myself. I need your help.
                         
          Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.
                         
          Robert winces in pain.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You alright?
                         
          Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees
          the awful purple bruise from the steering column.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
           Jesus, man! We gotta get you to a hospital.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, I just... have to get home...
           I'll deal with it in a couple of
           hours.
                         
                          JIMMY
           What if you don't make it a couple
           of hours?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Then I don't make it.
                         
                         
          EXT. THIRD AVENUE - NIGHT 46
                         
          The SUV stops a few blocks from Robert's house.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (through the window)
           Call me, alright, and let me know
           it's okay.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as he exits)
           Better we don't talk for a while.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (can't believe it--
           through the window)
           So what you get in a bind and just
           call up the only nigger you know?

          Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm sorry, Jimmy. I really am. Just
           go home.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yeah, alright, man. Take care of that.
                         
          Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT 47
                         
          Robert enters the basement. He runs into a security
          monitoring room. We see a street view of cameras outside the
          door he just entered. He pulls DISCS out of VIDEO RECORDERS.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - SERVICE KITCHEN 48
                         
          Robert stands in front of a bin marked INCINERATOR. He is
          wearing a new T-SHIRT and SLACKS.
                         
          He places all of his bloodied clothes and the video discs
          into the incinerator, pouring LIGHTER FLUID on top of them.
          Staring at the clothes, he notices one cuff link is missing.
                         
          He strikes a match, setting the items on fire and closes the
          hopper.
                         
          As he exits the burning area--
                         
                          SERVANT
           Everything okay, sir?
                         
          Robert turns, startled.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm fine, Glen. Go back to bed.
                         
          The servant shuffles off.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 49
                         
          Robert quietly undresses, leaving on the white UNDERSHIRT. He
          presses at his rib, winces again. Then he gets into bed and
          stares at the ceiling.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (HALF-ASLEEP)
           Where did you go?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 34.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (DREAMY)
           I woke up for a minute, you weren't
           here...
                         
                          ROBERT
           I just went to... eat some ice cream.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Was it good?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (pained, shifting his body)
           Yes...
                         
                          ELLEN
           Good. Don't forget to take your Lipitor in
           the morning...
                         
                          ROBERT
           Ellen...
                         
                          ELLEN
           What?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Do you still love me?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Of course I do...
                         
          She rolls over. Hold on Robert's face.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY 50
                         
          SYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert.
                         
                          SYD
           Hypothetically, the situation
           you're describing would be
           involuntary manslaughter.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And such a person...
                         
                          SYD
           ...would be in a lot of trouble,
           especially if that person was closing
           a merger with a large public bank
           where any publicity or arrest could
           delay or derail the transaction.

           But that's only if there was some
           evidence that could link him to
           the crime.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Fingerprints, DNA?
                         
                          SYD
           Very hard to collect after an explosion.
           The real world's different from television.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What about cell phone records?
                         
                          SYD
           Did this person make any calls from the area?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Not from a cell phone, no.
                         
                          SYD
           Then they won't be able to place him there.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What would you advise such a person
           to do?
                         
                          SYD
           To confess immediately.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Failing which?
                         
                          SYD
           To put as much distance between himself
           and the event as possible, if possible.
           But let me tell you something, and I'm
           speaking to you as a friend now: there
           are about fifty things that person
           wouldn't have thought of. And the more
           time that passes, the more lies that
           are told, the worse it gets for him.
                         
          Robert stands.

           Yeah.

                          SYD
           An accident's not the worst
           trouble. If we talk to them now we
           can probably work it out.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You tell me what happens if the
           Standard deal does not close, and I
           gotta tell my investors about our
           real losses?
                         
                          SYD
           Nothing good.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And what'd you say about the Justice
           Department? Depending on what they
           decide to arrest me on-- fraud
           conviction gets me twenty years?
                         
                          SYD
           I did.
                         
                          ROBERT

           Well, Standard wants to prepare for
           it now. So I was asked to go through
           every one of your trading books and
           reconfirm their assets.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No. Absolutely not. That's impossible.

           Don't worry. I put the team on

           GAVIN (O.S.)
           No, Brooke has a friend on the
           executive committee who said he's
           taking meetings in his room...
                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Maybe he's settling in.

          those Bryce Marden's there. They
          went up in value very quickly, and

          Why would you lease an apartment
          for Ms. Côte? Is that something you
          normally do for your employees?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Actually I said that she wasn't an
          employee, but-- I think she'd just come
          over from Paris if I remember, and she
          needed a place to entertain buyers.
                         
                          BRYER
          So you leased her this apartment.
                         
                          ROBERT
          It was through our holding company.
          You seem a little confused by all
          this...
                         
                          BRYER
                          (LAUGHS)
          I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Alright.
                         
                          BRYER
          Now, I don't mean to be
          indelicate...
                         
                          ROBERT
          But you're going to be
          indelicate...
                         
                          BRYER
          Well, from what I've been able to
          gather, she wasn't exactly an art
          star. I mean, she worked for a
          couple a dealers in Paris, but...
                         
                          ROBERT
          Oh, okay, I get it, so why would
          I invest in her and help her find
          a place?
                         
                          BRYER
          Something like that, yeah.
                         
                          ROBERT
          It's very simple, detective. I invest
          in people I believe in. I thought
          she'd do well, so I backed her, she
          did. It's is simple as that.

           Well that seems to make sense.
                          (BEAT)
           So we're all good with the
           apartment, then?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Sure.
                         
                          BRYER
           Thanks.
                         
          Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           What happened to your head?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          BRYER
           That's a nasty cut; I've been
           looking at that for the last five
           minutes. Does it hurt you?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (touching the cut)
           Oh, no, I just hit it on the
           medicine cabinet.
                         
                          BRYER
           Last night?
                         
                          ROBERT
           This morning.
                         
                          BRYER
           Hate when that happens.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah. Me, too.
                         
                          BRYER
           Well, thanks for the chat.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No problem.
                         
          Bryer heads out.
                         
          We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

          Ellen exits the building, passes the doorman and then Bryer,
          who is waiting in his car outside the multi-unit townhouse
          where she keeps her office.
                         
          She doesn't notice him as she passes and enters a TOWNCAR.
          She's about half-way into the car when he approaches.

                          BRYER
           Yeah, I was hoping to talk to you.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Well, I don't have time right now,

           Just take a couple a seconds. It's
           about your husband.

           Well, fine, but, make an appointment.
                         
          She closes the door and rides away. Bryer smiles in
          frustration, walks back to his car.

           Well, the wife blew me off-- which
           was interesting. And he didn't
           admit to the affair, but then he
           wouldn't, would he?

          Mills exits the car.
                         
                         
          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 67
                         
                          MILLS
           Mr. Grant?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes?
                         
                          MILLS
           NYPD Homicide, would you mind
           stepping into the car?
                         
                          JIMMY
           What's this about?
                         
                          BRYER
           (through the window)
           Just get in the car, Jimmy.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Am I under arrest?
                         
                          BRYER
           (through the window)
           You wanna be?
                         
                         
          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 68
                         
          Jimmy sits across the table from Mills and Bryer. They show
          him PHOTOS of Julie's burned body at the crash site.
                         
                          BRYER
           So let's do this again.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Man, for what? My answers ain't
           gonna change.
                         
                          BRYER
           You were asleep.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Right.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 51.
                         
                          BRYER
           And your phone rings.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Right.
                         
                          BRYER
           And it's a wrong number.
                         
          Jimmy doesn't answer.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Why do you accept the charges on a
           collect call from a wrong number?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I don't think I wanna answer any
           more questions.
                         
                          BRYER
           And you stay on the phone a minute and
           a half on a wrong number? What the
           fuck do you talk about, area codes?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I want to talk to my lawyer.
                         
                          MILLS
           Listen, kid, we know you went out
           there. We ID'd your photo with your
           neighbor who saw you getting into
           your truck ten minutes after this
           call was made.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Well if you got all that, what the
           fuck you need me for, officer?
                         
                          BRYER
           I don't think you understand the
           gravity of the situation here,
           Jimmy. This is a homicide.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Lawyer.
                         
                         
          INT. SYD'S LIMO - DAY 69
                         
          Robert rides with Syd. He reviews a DOCUMENT entitled
          "MAPLE LANE TRUST - James L. Grant - Beneficiary."
                         
          Robert signs the document, closing the folder.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 52.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're gonna sign him out?
                         
                          SYD
           I called in Earl Monroe.
                         
                          ROBERT
           The basketball player?
                         
                          SYD
           Civil rights attorney. You remember
           Crown Heights?
                         
                          ROBERT
           He's the best?
                         
                          SYD
           He's the best above 96th Street- and
           that doesn't make him any cheaper.
                         
          Robert slumps back, staring out the window.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You've gotta get Jimmy out of this.
                         
                          SYD
           It might not be that easy. If he
           doesn't cooperate they're likely to
           indict him on obstruction.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What would he be looking at?
                         
                          SYD
           Hard to say. With his prior... Five
           years, maybe ten.
                         
          Robert's silent.
                         
                         
          INT. BOND RELEASE AREA - DAY 70
                         
          Jimmy stands at the counter as EARL MONROE (50s, Black) signs
          papers. Bryer waits.
                         
                          BRYER
                          (TO JIMMY)
           This is not going to go away.
                         
          Jimmy ignores him and exits with Earl.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 71
                         
          Jimmy and Earl exit the buidling.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 53.
                         
                          EARL
           I'll call you tomorrow if there's any
           news. Don't worry about anything. And
           don't talk to anyone else. You take care.
                         
          Jimmy nods and walks up the street towards Syd's limo in the
          distance.
                         
                         
          INT. SYD'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS 72
                         
                          ROBERT
           Come on, get in.
                         
          Jimmy enters. The limo drives off.
                         
                          JIMMY
           All you said was you wanted a
           fucking ride! You didn't tell me
           you killed that girl!
                         
                          ROBERT
           Jimmy...
                         
                          JIMMY
           I'm trying to put my life back
           together. Okay, I appreciate you
           helped us, but now you're pushing
           it too far.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Like it was your ass sitting in
           there? Like you know a fucking
           thing about how it's gonna be?
                         
                          ROBERT
           We've got you the best criminal lawyer--
                         
                          JIMMY
           --Don't you got your own son for this?
           Why the hell you didn't call him?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Cause he woulda fucked it up, okay?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Well I'm sorry your son's a fuckin'
           idiot, but that ain't my fault.
                         
                          SYD
           This isn't productive.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 54.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Oh, okay. So tell us then, Syd,
           what happens now?
                         
                          SYD
           We meet with Earl and we go from
           there. I understand that right now
           they don't have enough to charge
           you with anything.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Your under suspicion.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Under suspicion? Motherfucker, I'm Black!
                         
                          ROBERT
           I am aware of that.
                         
                          JIMMY
           And what exactly would you like me
           to do about it?
                         
                          SYD
           (BUZZING the driver)
           Gentlemen, my driver will take you
           where you wanna go, but I cannot be
           a party to this conversation, so
           this is where I get out...
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET 73
                         
          Syd steps out of the limo and watches as it rolls away up
          Tenth Avenue.

                          JIMMY
           Why couldn't you have just stayed?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I couldn't.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Why not?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Because I have responsibilities.
           And if I stayed there, a lot of
           people would've been hurt.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Somebody was hurt.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 55.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Other people, Jimmy. I've got business
           troubles, you understand...? People
           rely on me.
                         
          Jimmy chews on this, dissatisfied.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Listen... I want to talk to you a second.
           Come here. I wanna show you something.
                         
          Jimmy slides over to sit next to Robert.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Now, you know, your father asked me
           to look after you.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yeah.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, I know I messed up, alright?
           I'm sorry. But I do want to help
           you, you know that.
           (handing Jimmy the folder)
           So I've been able to set up a
           situation for you.
                         
                          JIMMY
           What's that?
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's a trust. In your name, assets
           of $2 Million dollars. Take a look
           at that.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (ASTOUNDED)
           Are you serious? You think money's
           gonna fix this?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What else is there?
                         
          Jimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (to the driver)
           Yo, yo man, pull over.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (stares at him)
           What are you gonna do?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 56.
                         
                          JIMMY
           I look like a fucking snitch to you?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I don't know, Jimmy. I don't know.
           Are you?
                         
          Jimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Wait, wait, wait. Sorry. Just--
           read it. Just take it home and read

          Brooke sits alone in the accountant's office we saw earlier.
          She reviews SPREADSHEETS on his COMPUTER and compares them
          with PRINTOUTS from a FILE CABINET that she has broken open.
                         
          Numbers from the screen reflect across her reading glasses as
          she stares in disbelief. She DIALS a number.

          Brooke taps the keyboard and a PRINTER spits out pages.
          Suddenly, BEN (40s), an accountant we saw earlier, appears.

           shoulder to stop her.

           jury room... Look, Ray. We like
           this kid. I don't wanna lose him.
           Think about it: if we flip him, you
           get Robert Miller. What's that
           worth to Rittenband, and to you for
           that matter...?
                          (HARD)
           Twenty years, Ray. Twenty fucking
           years, we watch these guys- they
           out-lawyer us, they out-buy us. I'm
           fucking sick of it. Where's the
           consequence? The guy did it. He
           does not get to walk just cause
           he's on CNBC.

          Robert enters, moving much slower. As he approaches Cindy, he
          sees a worried look on her face.

          Robert enters. Brooke's at the window in a chair. It's clear
          that she has been crying.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (APPROACHING HER)
           Sweetie, you okay? What's wrong?
                         
          Brooke holds out her hands. She has two copies of the "Old

          Robert stands there a moment, staring at her.

          They walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake.
          Robert sits, motions to Brooke.

          You remember Alexanderov? Well he
          came to see me one day last year.
          He said "Robert, we've got a great
          opportunity- there's a copper mine,
          it's in Russia, it's under-
          exploited- there's billions under
          the ground, and to get it out, all
          we need is a couple hundred
          million, you put in a hundred,
          we'll put in a hundred- we'll
          triple it all in six months." So, I
          go check it out. And the geological
          survey's right, friendly
          government. And to lock it in, you
          hedge it, right? Sell the copper
          ahead on the commodities exchange
          and it all works, it's fine, and
          you're making a fortune.

          But then there's something I hadn't
          accounted for-- variation margin--
          and that friendly Russian
          government all of a sudden not so
          friendly anymore and they're
          blocking the export of the copper
          so I gotta make it up, I gotta put
          the cash in to cover the hedge. But
          I'm not worried about it because
          it's still springing money, there's
          so much money coming out of the

          Nobody's getting arrested. That's why
          I borrowed the money from Jeffrey.
          Plug the hole, I put it there for a
          month, they see the books are fine, I
          transfer the company, I pay back
          Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all

           Really?
                         
          Jimmy's silent.

           You lied to me. You lied to the
           police. You obstructed justice.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Talk to Earl, Detective.
                         
                          BRYER
           Fuck Earl! You see this?
           (holds up the grand jury
                          DOCKET)
           This means that tomorrow, grand
           jury hears your case in court. And
           tomorrow in court I'm gonna ask for
           a felony obstruction indictment,
           and with with your prior, you are
           going to prison for fifteen fucking
           years... You might get out in ten.
           You'll be what then? Thirty-three,
           with no job, no girl, no life.
                         
          Bryer pulls the car over.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Look: I know you think Miller's
           your friend.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Who's Miller?
                         
                          BRYER
           I know about your father.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (beat, then hard)
           You don't know a Goddamn thing
           about my father.
                         
                          BRYER
           I know Miller paid his bills while
           he was dying. I know he got Syd
           Felder to get you out of trouble on
           your gun charge. That doesn't add
           up to this.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You done?
                         
                          BRYER
           Okay, he's driving, he crashes- he
           runs away- who does he call? Calls
           you. Why do you think that is?

           `Cause you're disposable- you're
           the one person he could call that
           just doesn't fuckin' matter. You're
           a- you're a throwaway. You're just
           another part of his transaction.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (tries to open the locked door)
           Will you open the door?
                         
                          BRYER
           So what, what? You're his new
           nigger now?
                         
          Jimmy grabs at the door violently. It's locked.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Open-- OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!
                         
                          BRYER
           You didn't kill that girl. He did.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (containing his rage)
           Will you -- open -- the door?
                         
                          BRYER
           He's using you. I know it - you
           know it. Do the right thing. Now
           get outta my fuckin' car.
                         
          Bryer unlocks the door. Jimmy exits and walks up the block.

          It's nearly empty. Ramon, the limo driver, plays Solitaire at
          a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.
                         
                          SYD
           He's gonna walk.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're certain?
                         
                          SYD
           Courts aren't for certainty, but he
           says he was at home, why shouldn't
           he be? A phone call doesn't make
           him a liar.
           (off Robert's nod)
           But what's baffling to me, though,
           despite your sentimental history
           together, is why you would put your
           family's future in this kid's hands.

           She's good. Fine.
           (stops packing, looks up)
           Why?
                         
                          SYD
           I heard something...
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yes...?
                         
                          SYD
           She met with Gil Deuchman.
                         
                          ROBERT
           The estate lawyer?
                         
                          SYD
           Yeah. Has she mentioned anything?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Not to me.
                         
          They sit in silence.
                         
                         
          INT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY 88
                         
          We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The
          prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next
          to Jimmy.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           That was the early morning of April 11th.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.

           You received a phone call?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Who called you?
                         
          Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.
                         
                          JIMMY
           It was a wrong number.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           That's a lie, isn't it, Mr. Grant?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           You stayed on the phone one-and-a-
           half minutes... Mr. Grant, isn't it
           the case that you know exactly who
           called you and exactly why? Why are
           you lying to this court?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I'm not lying.
                         
          DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He
          picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I'm going to introduce into evidence
           People's A. This is a toll booth
           photograph taken in the northbound ninth
           lane of the Triborough bridge. Mr. Grant,
           directing your attention to the
           photograph, would you please read the
           date and time stamp indicated on the
           lower right hand corner?
                         
          Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.
                         
                          JIMMY
           This is crazy.
                         
                          EARL
           (whispers in Jimmy's ear)
           You're gonna have to answer that.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Mr. Grant, please answer the question.

                          DEFERLITO
           Mr. Grant, directing your attention
           to the same photograph, would you
           please read the license plate
           number of the vehicle passing
           through the toll?

                          DEFERLITO
           (handing in another sheet)
           This is People's B, a printout from
           the Department of Motor Vehicles
           plate registry... Mr. Grant,
           directing your attention to that
           printout, are those numbers on the
           toll photograph the same ones that
           are on your own license plate?
                         
          Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           Yes, the numbers are the same?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Yes.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           How do you explain that?
                         
                          JIMMY
           I can't.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           But that is your car in this
           photograph, isn't it?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           No, that is not your car?
           (off his silence)
           Answer the question, Mr. Grant.

                          JIMMY
           This is not my car in this picture.
           I don't know how you all did that,
           but this is not my car.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           You expect this grand jury to
           believe that that is not your car
           when there is a printout from the
           department of motor vehicles...
                         
                          EARL
           That's asked and answered, Mr. Deferlito.
                         
                          DEFERLITO

          Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.
                         
                          EARL
           Jimmy. Jimmy-- what was that?
                         
                          JIMMY
           They're lying!
                         
                          EARL
           Okay, now here's what...
                         
          Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over
          to them.
                         
                          BRYER
           I can halt the decision.
                         
                          EARL
           We need a minute, Detective.
                         
                          BRYER
           What about you, Jimmy? You need a minute?
                         
          Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Cause if you do we could...
                         
                          JIMMY
           You can get the fuck outta my face.
           How `bout that?.

           you ready to tell me something?
                         
                          EARL
           Detective, I need to talk to my client.
           Now if you would just please...
                         
                          JIMMY
           How you- How you all just gonna lie
           like that? Huh? How you all just
           gonna lie?!
                         
                          BRYER
           We didn't lie. You lied.
                         
                          JIMMY
           That wasn't my car.
                         
                          EARL
           ...Jimmy, don't say anything else.
                         
                          BRYER
           Sure it wasn't. And it was a
           telemarketer called you from the pay
           phone? He stopped at the Chevron to
           make a late night sale?
                         
                          JIMMY
           That picture was some bullshit...
                         
                          EARL
           ...Jimmy, stop! Detective, what's
           going on?
                         
                          BRYER
           Well, tell him. Go ahead, Jimmy.
           Tell him. See how the boss'll like
           this one.
                         
          Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.
                         
                          BRYER (CONT'D)
           Last chance.
                         
          Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.
                         
                          EARL
           (rising, to Jimmy)
           Wait here.
                         
          Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

          Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards
          Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.
                         
                         
          INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY 90
                         
          About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front
          are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.
                         
          Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art
          opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at
          him quietly, then quickly looks away.
                         
          There is no organized service; people are just walking up to
          the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and
          holds a moment at the casket.
                         
          The gallery assistant comes up behind him.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Mr. Miller. I would like to introduce
           you to Julie's mom, Sandrine.
                         
          A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert
          approaches as she stands.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I am so, so sorry.
                         
                          SANDRINE
           (nods, then)
           I just wanted to thank you for what
           you did for my daughter.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (shaking his head softly)
           No...
                         
                          SANDRINE
           You believed in her, and you gave
           her a chance. She was happy. I know
           she was happy.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's just...
                          (EMOTIONAL)
           not fair, is it?
                         
          Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           This shouldn't have happened.
                         
          Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

          Close on Brooke's legs, running on a treadmill. Ellen
          exercises on a STAIRMASTER next to her. We hear the sound of
          Ellen's small talk begin to fade in.
                         
                          ELLEN
           ...she's rail thin. She's a blond.
           I would not have known who she was
           if she hadn't come up and
           introduced herself to me. She
           looked totally different... and...
           (notices Brooke increasing
           the machine's resistance)
           You're going straight to level six
           don't you think you better pace
           yourself a little bit?
                         
                          BROOKE
           (fakes a smile)
           I'm good. I wanna run.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Everything okay with you and Tom?
                         
                          BROOKE
           We're fine.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Are you worried about the deal closing?
                         
                          BROOKE
                          (STRIDES FASTER)
           No.
                         
                          ELLEN
           You want me to guess?
                          (NO RESPONSE)
           Brookie, come on, don't be silly,
           tell me what's...
                         
          Brooke stabs "Stop" on the machine, quickly cooling down.
                         
                          BROOKE

           You know, I can't stay for
           breakfast I have to just... I have
           to get in to work, I don't know
           what I was thinking.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (A BEAT)
           Did you uh, finish the deal with
           the hospital?

                          BROOKE
           No.
                         
          Ellen stops her machine.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Why not?
                         
                          BROOKE

           We don't lie to each other, Brooke.
                         
                          BROOKE
           I'm not lying to you. It's
           complicated; you wouldn't understand.
                         
          Ellen crosses closer to Brooke blocking her exit.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (A BEAT)
           Uh, I know that a policeman showed
           up at the office? Do you know what
           that's about?
                         
                          BROOKE
           I honestly have no idea.
                         
                          ELLEN
           What about your father's head-
           where he cut his head and the pain
           that he's hiding in his stomach
           and, now
           (starts to tear)
           For some reason that's way to
           complicated for me to understand,
           there's no money for a routine
           gift? Does that seem a little
           strange to you?
                         
                          BROOKE
           Of course it's strange.
                         
                          ELLEN
           So tell me what's happening.

           What do you want me to say? He's my
           dad. I have to trust him.
                         
                          ELLEN
           No. You have to do what's right for
           you. Not him, not me, not anyone.
           This is your life.
                         
          Ellen grabs Brooke and hugs her hard. Brooke hugs back,
          kissing her mother on the cheek, tearing.

           I gotta go.
                         
          Hold on Ellen alone as Brooke exits.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (SOTTO)
           Fuck.

          JAMES MAYFIELD (50s) waits alone at a table. Robert enters.
          They shake hands, then sit.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You keep sending people to my
           office to "do business."
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           They're just getting acquainted.
                         
                          ROBERT

           Just coffee, please.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           You remember what it was like on
           our side of the fence. Everything
           just moves... a little slower. Plus
           this whole audit mess doesn't help.
           You know, clearing that all up...

           Fuck you.

                          ROBERT
          FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of

          did not come to you.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
          Robert, I think we're getting off

                          ROBERT
          No, no, no. Forget it, forget it...
          Forget the deal. I don't even care
          about the deal. No, I run a
          comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a
          THRIVING business, that has returned
          year-to-date 15.4% percent to our

          Million dollars from a trading
          operation that you don't have and
          that we both know that you need, or
          else you never would've called me in
          the first place. You on the other
          hand, you've taken a salary of
           (sotto from the waitress
           pouring his coffee)
          18 Million?
           (returns to volume)
          And what have you delivered? A
          falling stock price of negative 14
          dollars? Is that what it is? You've
          also lost approximately... THREE AND
          A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS-

           Your price is too high.
                         
          Robert stands.

           Four-fifty.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Five twenty-five. That's it. Yes or no?
                          (SHORT BEAT)
           And if it's no, send any further
           communication right to my trash can.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           (extending his hand)
           It's a deal.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (GRASPING IT)
           One other thing -- six months and I'm
           gonna be gone. I'm outta here. My
           daughter's gonna take it over. You
           know her, you trust her.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Alright.
                         
                          ROBERT
           And you're gonna have to make my
           son a VP.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
                          (LAUGHS)
           Robert...
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, no. He doesn't have to do
           anything, he just gets the salary,
           he gets the office. Both of `em on
           five-year employment contracts, and
           my lawyers draft them. Yes or no?
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Yes.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 82.
                         
          Robert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they
          have just outlined onto the paper menu.
                         
                          MAYFIELD (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm writing the deal.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Are you serious?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (ripping off the tablecloth)
           I'm serious. I'm very serious. Sign it.
                         
          Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu.
          Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           I'll send over a draft of the press release.
                         
          As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib.
                         
                          MAYFIELD (CONT'D)
           Are you all right?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'm fine... Before I go -- how much
           would you have paid...?
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Six hundred. And you would've taken...?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Four seventy-five.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           So we made a good deal.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as he heads away)
           Yeah.
                         
          Robert turns back to the table.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Actually, I lied. I would've taken four.
                         
          Mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of
          the restaurant, beaming.

          INT. MILLER CAPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER 93
                         
          Peter, Gavin, and many of the various STAFF we have met are
          gathered around a long conference table. Robert stands at the
          front of the room.
                         
                          ROBERT
           ...Anyway I will be seeing most of
           you at the gala tomorrow night. But
           as the sale's official as of this
           afternoon, you are now free to talk
           about it. Any questions?
                         
                          PETER
                          (JOVIAL)
           Will we get new business cards?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (NODS)
           Yes, everyone but you.
                          (HEADING OUT)
           Alright, it's a great day. Your
           hard work made it happen
                         
          They all clap as Gavin and Robert exit the room.
                         
                          GAVIN
                          (SOTTO)
           So how'd you make Mayfield come around?
                         
                          ROBERT
           I met his price. I just took it out of
           your share.
                         
                          GAVIN
           Robert?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah.
                         
                          GAVIN
           Good work.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Well, thank you. Now go get me that
           fucking hospital check.
                         
          Gavin walks off. Robert's cell RINGS.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah.

          EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK 94
                         
          Robert heads through a dark service entrance towards a
          buzzer, then down a long hallway.
                         
                          ROBERT (PRE-LAP)
           Hello.
                         
                         
          INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT 95
                         
          Reina, Jimmy's girlfriend (24, Hispanic) stands at the door
          with Robert and Jimmy. She turns and heads to the bedroom.
                         
          Jimmy heads to the kitchen.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You want something to drink?
                         
                          ROBERT
           What you got?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Not much.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You got any milk?
                         
                          JIMMY
           No.
                         
                          ROBERT
           I'll take a water.
                         
          Jimmy starts running the tap. Robert notices the moving BOXES.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Where are you going?
                         
                          JIMMY
           What?
                         
                          ROBERT
           The boxes.
                         
                          JIMMY
           I was planning on Virginia, but it
           looks like I'm not going anymore.
                         
          Jimmy returns with the water. Robert take a drink.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
           You waiting for me to say something?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 85.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I told you not to take the toll.
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yes, you did.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I said "Listen to what I have to
          tell you and follow my directions,
          listen to me closely, do the
          following just like I say."
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yes. You said all that.
                         
                          ROBERT
          But you took the toll anyway.
                         
                          JIMMY
          No, I did not.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie
          to me...
                         
                          JIMMY
          I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all
          the Goddamn way there. I did what you
          said: I didn't stop. I didn't take
          the Triborough. I followed all your
          fucking instructions.
                         
                          ROBERT
          So where'd they get the photograph from?
                         
                          JIMMY
          You tell me.
                         
                          ROBERT
          So, you're saying... it's a fake?
                         
                          JIMMY
          How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?
                         
                          ROBERT
          Don't be such a wiseass...
                         
                          JIMMY
          Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man!
          Earl's telling me it could be ten
          years? Ten fucking years! How much
          are ten years worth, Robert?
           (off his silence)
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 86.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
          Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin
          snitch, but this is bad. This is real
          bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're
          about to make happen next week!
                         
                          ROBERT
           (as Jimmy sits)
          What plan?
                         
                          JIMMY
          I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.
                         
                          ROBERT
          What business?
                         
                          JIMMY
          I bought an Applebee's.
                         
                          ROBERT
          What's an Applebee's?
                         
                          JIMMY
          It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's
          a chain restaurant.
                         
                          ROBERT
          You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?
                         
                          JIMMY
          Is this really what you came here to
          talk about? What are you gonna do?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SITS)
          It's not really that simple, Jimmy.
          I'm in a situation now.
                         
                          JIMMY
          What situation?
                         
                          ROBERT
          I told you... right now, if I were to
          speak, a lot of people would get hurt.
          Jobs, families. A lot of innocent
          people. Do you think you can
          understand that?
                         
                          JIMMY
          Yeah but what about me? What about my
          situation?
           (off his silence)
          They showed me pictures, man;
          that's fucked up what you did.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 87.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SOTTO)
           It was an accident.
                         
                          JIMMY
           And yeah, I know, all the people
           counting on you, whatever, but --
           you told me Earl was gonna make
           this right. Now you know I care
           about you, all the things you did
           for us, and for my father, but Earl
           said they're offering me a deal, no
           charges at all. I walk away. They
           just want to know who I went to
           pick up.
                          (BEAT)
           Why are you putting me in this
           position, man? Why are you putting
           me in this situation?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LEANS FORWARD)
           Can you just hang tight? Just a
           little longer?
                         
                          JIMMY
           Alright, man, but Earl said the deal's
           on the table for twenty-four hours.
           After that, they're filing the case,
           and Earl says we're gonna lose.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (nods, stands)
           Alright I hear you. I'll be back
           with you as soon as I can. Just
           hang with me a little bit.
                         
          Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the
          living room as he approaches the door and exits.
                         
                          REINA
           You gotta give him up.
                         
                          JIMMY
           You said take the money.
                         
                          REINA
           That was to keep quiet, not to go away.
                          (BEAT)
           What's he offering you now?
                         
                          JIMMY
           What can he offer me?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 88.
                         
          Reina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then
          wipes away his tears.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - NIGHT 96
                         
          The limo drives down Fifth Avenue. Robert's on the phone.
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           We went to the toll authority. They
           said they gave the tape to the cops.
           I've requested our investigator go
           examine it at the evidence room, but
           honestly what's the point?
                         
                          ROBERT
           He says he didn't take the toll.
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           And you believe him?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (after a beat)
           Does Standard have clawback?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           What? What do you mean?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Let's just say I decide to go in...
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           Have you lost your mind?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, just listen, listen to me. If I
           were to surrender, now, could they roll
           back the deal?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           (after a beat)
           No, what's done is done. There's no
           intent to defraud. You haven't warranted
           any behavior. So it's just money.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Four years, you think?
                         
           SYD (O.S.)
           At this point- I dunno, they're not
           gonna make it easy.... I really suggest
           you think about this.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 89.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (BEAT)
           Call the DA, get it started.
                         
          Robert hangs up. He stares out the window at Central Park.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT 97
                         
          He enters the foyer and ascends the steps to his bedroom.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 98
                         
          No Ellen. He looks at his watch: "8:34PM."
                         
          He moves over towards the bed and dials the tableside PHONE.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, Glen. Did Mrs. Miller say where
           she was going tonight...? Aha... No,
           I'm sure... I'll try her cell.
                         
          He clicks off and DIALS another number, hears Ellen's voice
          mail come on the line, and hangs up.
                         
          He exhales and lies down on the bed in his clothes, staring
          at the ceiling. He lies motionless a moment.
                         
          And then he sits up, thinks, and shakes his head.
                         
          He quickly picks up the phone, stabbing at the keys.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Syd...? Yeah- Did you make that call
           to the DA yet...? Thank God. No, no,
           no. No. Listen to me, call Earl, tell
           him to get his car, tell him to meet
           us at my house in twenty minutes...
           And, Syd...? Bring a notary.
                         
                         
          EXT. TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE - NIGHT 99
                         
          A steady stream of CARS passes through the toll. We follow a
          BLUE LEXUS as it approaches the far right lane.
                         
                         
          INT. LEXUS - SAME 100
                         
          Earl Monroe pays the TOLL CLERK through the window, getting a
          RECEIPT. Then he pulls his car to the side of the road, parking
          at a BUILDING labelled "Port Authority - Administration."
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 90.
                         
           He opens a LAPTOP on the passenger seat, typing numbers from
           the toll receipt into a little box on the screen. A portable
           PRINTER spits out pages. Earl stamps them with a NOTARY.
                         
                         
           INT. TOLL AUTHORITY - NIGHT 101
                         
           Earl waits at the front desk of the drab government office.
           BRENT, a balding man in his 30's, approaches.
                         
                          BRENT
           Hi I'm Brent Owens, the night
           supervisor. How can I help you?
                         
                          EARL
           (handing him some papers)
           Hello, Brent. I'm Earl Monroe. I'm
           executing a criminal evidence request.
           I need to get a look at one of your
           lane tapes.
                         
           Brent looks over the papers, confused.
                         
                          BRENT
           I don't understand. This says you
           want to look at a tape made ten
           minutes ago...?
                         
                         
           INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS 102
                         
           Robert and Syd stare ahead, silently. Syd tries to say something.
                         
                          ROBERT
           (holding up his hand)
           Wait. Wait. Just wait.
                         
          121 Syd slumps back. They keep staring at nothing. 121
                         
           A RAPPING noise on the window startles Syd, who rolls it
           down, sees Earl, and opens the door.
                         
           Earl climbs inside, removing a FOLIO from his breast pocket
           as he talks.
                         
                          EARL
           Okay, they won't release tapes
           without a court order, but they did
           give me a print out, the same kind
           they used at Jimmy's indictment.
                         
           Earl reaches inside the folio and removes the PHOTOGRAPH he
           got from the toll authority. He lays it on the counter.
                         
           It's from a toll camera, showing his car and license plate.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 91.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (TO EARL)
           The Lexus- that's your car, your plate?
                         
          Earl nods.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
                          (TO SYD)
           You got Jimmy's?
                         
          Syd lays the PHOTOGRAPH we saw earlier of Jimmy's car going
          through the toll onto the counter next to the one Earl has
          just placed there.
                         
          Robert picks up a high-end MAGNIFYING GLASS and leans over to
          look at the two photos.
                         
                         CLOSE-UP:
                         
          He scans the photograph of Earl's car, moving slowly
          through it left-to-right.
                         
          Then he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to-
          right until --
                         
          He passes back by the license plate area and stops --
                         
          The lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all
          slightly-pixelated.
                         
          He switches back to the plate on Earl's car. The lines are
          fine. Back to Jimmy's. Pixelated.
                         
          Robert puts down the magnifier, straightens, and smiles.
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           Son of a bitch.
                         
          Earl's dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY 103
                         
          Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE
          RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Well they look a little different to me,
           too... Is there a reason you haven't
           allowed Mr. Monroe's investigator to
           conduct his own analysis?
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 92.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           We've had some issues regarding
           chain-of-custody...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...You don't have them anymore.
           You're to meet him with the evidence
           in the next hour.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I'm afraid that's not possible.
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Where's the tape?
                          (ANOTHER BEAT)
           Am I not speaking loud enough?
                         
                          BRYER
           Your honor...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Yes?
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           It seems there's been...
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...Let him tell me.
                         
                          BRYER
           We don't know where it is.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Come again?
                         
                          BRYER
           It's not in the evidence locker.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Where is it?
                         
                          BRYER
           We don't know.
                         
          Silence. Rittenband leans forward.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           I'll ask you one last time,
           detective. Where is the tape?
                         
                          BRYER
           (after a beat)
           We lost it.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 93.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Hmmm... In light of these
           developments, and I would think you
           should be very happy to hear this,
           with Mr. Monroe's approval I'm going
           to offer Mr. Deferlito the
           opportunity to voluntarily dismiss
           the indictment to save us all a
           bunch of embarrassment.
                         
                          DEFERLITO
           I don't feel comfortable with that,
           your honor.
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           Further I'm going to put all charges
           against Mr. Grant under seal.
           (Bryer starts heading to
                          THE DOOR)
           This case is dismissed with prejudice
           and it is not to be refiled. HOLD ON,
           Detective.
           (Bryer stops.)
           If you have another suspect in the
           automobile death then you are to present
           him, but Mr. Grant is free from any
           further inquiry in this matter. This is
           over. Do I have your understanding?
                         
                          EARL
           Thank you.
                         
          Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

           Close the door, detective,
           please...
                         
          Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

           You finessed these, didn't you...?
                         
                          BRYER
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          RITTENBAND
           ...You finessed it. I know it, and
           you know it.

                          RITTENBAND (CONT'D)
           I know who you're after. I saw all the
           evidence, not just the toll photo. You
           gotta get him the right way.
                         
                          BRYER
           Oh, okay.
           (approaches the judge)
           So let me get this straight: What
           you're telling me is I'm supposed to
           sit around with my thumb up my ass
           and my fingers crossed hoping that
           one of these fucking days, somewhere
           down the line, one of these rich
           assholes is gonna say the wrong thing
           LOUD enough so that we can't choose
           to ignore it anymore?

           Get the fuck outta of my office.
                         
                          BRYER
           Yes, your honor.
                         
                         
          INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - MOMENTS LATER 104
                         
          Mills waits on a nearby bench, watching as Bryer exits the
          chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and
          grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.
          Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.
                         
                          BRYER
           (on the phone)
           Well when do you expect her...? When
           do you expect her? Okay, well so I
           don't have to call a ninth time, will
           you take down what I'm sayin', word
           for word...? Okay, you got a pencil?
           You ready? Okay, here goes: "Mrs.
           Miller- Exactly how fuckin' stupid do
           you really think I am?"

          Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You didn't hurt anybody. You helped
           a lot of people.

                          JIMMY
           And this piece of paper makes
           everything okay?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, it makes it easier.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (BEAT)
           You worried I'm gonna say something?
                         
                          ROBERT
           No.
                         
          Jimmy keeps staring at the document.
                         
                          JIMMY
           Robert, look: you asked me to come
           meet you and I'm here, but I came
           because I wanted to get something
           straight between us: we're even.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Okay, we're even. But just for the
           record though, what you did...
           (picks up the trust document)
           Was way beyond the money.
                         
                          JIMMY
                          (LAUGHS)
           Nothing's beyond money for you.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS BACK)
           Thanks a lot.
                         
                          JIMMY
           (pointing to the document)
           And if I take this, then what does
           that say about me?
                         
          He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in
          his pocket.
                         
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
           Fuck it. I'm gonna take your money
           and do something good with it.
                         
          Hold on Jimmy.
                         
                         
          INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 106
                         
          Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa
          finishing a drink.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 96.
                         
          Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Hey, sweetie. What time you wanna
           get there...? I don't wanna get
           there too soon...
                         
          She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...
                         
                          ROBERT (CONT'D)
           (tying his tie)
           You okay? What is it?
                         
                          ELLEN
           You spoke to Brooke?
                         
          He slows... Something's brewing.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Did she tell you that?
                         
                          ELLEN
           No. She didn't have to.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, I explained to Brooke that...
                         
                          ELLEN
           ...you explained, did you?
                          (A BEAT)
           Did you tell her everything?
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yes.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Everything?
           (off his silence)
           Lift up your shirt.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Lift up -- your shirt.
                         
          He doesn't move.
                         
          She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a
          NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.
                         
          He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

                          ELLEN (CONT'D)
          Did you tell her about that?
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LONG BEAT)
          Ellen I don't know what you think
          you know...
                         
                          ELLEN
          Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.
          You've been sneaking off to see her for
          months. You don't think I know that?
                         
                          ROBERT
          What do you think you know?
                         
                          ELLEN
          I never cared, really, about your
          secretaries, your- gallerists,
          whores, whatever you wanna call them.
          I cared about our home. And now you
          have brought this to our door.
                         
                          ROBERT
          I did what was necessary.
                         
                          ELLEN
          No you did what was necessary for
          you, Robert, for your interests.
                         
                          ROBERT
          For my interests?
                         
                          ELLEN
          Yes.
                         
                          ROBERT
          Everything I do is for us, for this
          family, and now you're gonna tell
          me how to run my business.
                         
                          ELLEN
          This isn't about your business,
          this is our life! Where do you
          think we're going tonight? Why do
          you think I've even tolerated this
          for so long?
                         
                          ROBERT
           (he's had enough)
          What you've tolerated? Wow!
                         
                          ELLEN
          I'm glad you find that funny.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 98.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What about me? What about the
           complaints? The unhappiness? The
           drinking? The shopping? The
           trainers? Everything! But yes, the
           charities, the wonderful sainted
           charities, you know, all the
           wonderful works that you do. How do
           you think I've paid for them?
                         
                          ELLEN
           I didn't ask you because I didn't
           want you to lie.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (WALKS OFF)
           It's cause you didn't want to give
           `em up!
                         
                          ELLEN
           But I thought that we had an
           understanding. And you broke that
           understanding when you brought
           Brooke into it.
                         
                          ROBERT
           No, I kept her out.
                         
                          ELLEN
           When you made Brooke complicit-- when
           you risked her future-- and I'm done.
                         
          She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides
          them toward him.
                         
                          ROBERT
           What is this?
                         
                          ELLEN
           Read it.
                         
          He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the
          title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a
          few brief seconds until...
                         
                          ROBERT
           "All ownership and voting rights
           transfer to the Miller Charitable
           Foundation, to be administered by
           Brooke Miller?" Did you really
           expect me to sign this thing?
                         
                          ELLEN
           You're not following.

                          ROBERT
           Apparently not, no. No.
                         
                          ELLEN
           (like talking to a child)
           Okay, uhm, the police have been
           trying to talk me. I assume they
           want to know where you were that
           night. And you know what? I'm not
           gonna lie for you anymore. Not
           unless you sign that.
                         
          A beat.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Yeah, this leaves me with nothing.
                         
                          ELLEN
           I think you'll find a way to
           manage. I'm sure you have all kinds
           of things offshore for a rainy day.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           This is fuckin' crazy.
                         
                          ELLEN
                          (FAST)
           No, if you sign, then I'll tell your
           lie. I'll say you were at home with
           me that night, all night, together,
           here, and you'll be free and clear.
           And the people who need our money
           will get it. That's my price.
                         
                          ROBERT
           You're out of your mind. I am not
           signing that. I will not sign that!
                         
                          ELLEN
           Well then... I'll have to tell them
           that you came home at four-thirty
           bruised and bleeding...
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (LAUGHS)
           That's fucking ridiculous! What...
           (crosses close to her)
           Are you trying to blackmail me?
                         
                          ELLEN
           I think we call it negotiating.

                          ROBERT
           You're not gonna win that one.
           There's no fucking way.
                         
                          ELLEN
           You know what, it'll cause just
           enough trouble- the kind of trouble
           that you don't want-- In fact,
           according to my lawyer
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (PACES)
           Fucking lawyer...
                         
                          ELLEN
           It's enough to give them probable
           cause and then they can subpoena
           your cell phone, GPS, DNA,
                         
                          ROBERT
           Fuck the DNA! I'm sick of this!
                         
                          ELLEN
           And whatever else they can think of.
           So really Robert what you have is a
           choice: you can spend the next three
           years in court and in the tabloids
           or-- you can be at your business.
                         
                          ROBERT
                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           You won't do it. You won't do this.
           You won't do it to the kids.
                         
                          ELLEN
           Just try me.
                         
          He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.
                         
                          ELLEN (CONT'D)
                          (FINALLY CRIES)
           You broke -- our little girl's heart.
                         
                          ROBERT
           It's how it all works, Ellen. You
           know that.
                         
                          ELLEN
           I do, but she didn't.
                         
                          ROBERT
           She'll be better for it. The world is cold.

           (turns and heads out)
           Then you're gonna need a warm coat.
                         
          We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."
                         
                         
          INT. MAYFIELD'S LIMO - NIGHT 107
                         
          The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of
          memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN
          AIMES, sits nearby.
                         
                          AIMES
           There's just one more thing... And
           I hate to mention it now, but I
           just received it...
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Speak, John.
                         
          Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.
                         
                          AIMES
           I had Stern Marling run a secondary
           audit on the Miller financials.
                         
          We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:
                         
          "STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have
          reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to
          legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412
          Million..."
                         
          We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the
          spreading realization.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           Who authorized this?
                         
                          AIMES
           I did.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           (after a beat)
           And what did you conclude?
                         
                          AIMES
           It's in front of you.
                         
                          MAYFIELD
                          (LAUGHS)
           I didn't ask you what the paper said,
           John. I asked you what you thought.
           Goldenrod - 4.17.11 102.
                         
                          AIMES
           (after a beat, carefully)
           Well... what do you think?
                         
                          MAYFIELD
           I think... I think... that I don't
           see anything wrong here.
                         
          Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his
          papers. Aimes nods.
                         
                         
          EXT. PLAZA HOTEL 108
                         
          They arrive at the Plaza Hotel and exit the car
                         
                         
          INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT 109
                         
          We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to
          the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:
          "Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."
                         
                         
          INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER 110
                         
          Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,
          Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.
          Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.
                         
          We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the
          room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the
          distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.
                         
                          BROOKE
           ...and to receive this prestigious
           award, I invite now to the stage
           the man who led this generous
           effort, and whose financial trading
           firm, Miller Capital, has just this
           morning been acquired by Standard
           Bank and Trust, a dedicated
           businessman, family man, scholar,
           philanthropist and all-around
           humanitarian, a man I am lucky to
           call -- my mentor, my friend -- and
           my father -- Mr. Robert Miller...
                         
          Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way
          to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,
          takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
