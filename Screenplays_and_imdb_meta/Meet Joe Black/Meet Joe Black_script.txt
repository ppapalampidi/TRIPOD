     --------------------------------------------------------------

     EXT. ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. - 4:00 AM

     A patch of water. PULL BACK TO REVEAL more water.  BACK
     FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
     massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
     manor house; the country estate of William Parrish.

     INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM

     MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
     an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
     Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists
     and trees and small boats and distant humans.

     INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM

     MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
     ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
     occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
     man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.

     Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
     Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
     of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
     up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
     wind itself:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          ... Yes.

     Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
     not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
     the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.

     He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
     outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
     up:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          Yes...

     It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
     heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
     can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
     ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
     trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
     heard; he is not sure.

     He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
     eyes.

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          Yes.

     Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
     there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
     should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
     stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
     light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
     then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
     finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.

     EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING

     The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
     rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
     adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,
     speakers, lights.  Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's
     older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
     relishing every moment.

     A Painter approaches.

                    PAINTER
          The big tent, Miss Allison --

                    ALLISON
          Paint is rust and moss green.
          Medieval colors -- Daddy's like
          an old knight.

     A Florist stops her.

                    FLORIST
          The head table --?

                    ALLISON
          What about it?

                    FLORIST
          The flowers, ma'am--?

                    ALLISON
          Freesia, freesia, everywhere.  Daddy
          loves freesia -- and you, over there,
          lights.  Not too bright.  I'm looking
          for a saffron glow -- sort of tea-
          dance twenties.

     EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

     Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-
     ing the activity outside through the windows.  He checks his
     watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
     retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
     passes.

                    PARRISH
          What do you think of all this, May?

                    MAY
          It's going to be beautiful.  And
          Miss Allison says the President may
          come.

                    PARRISH
          Oh, the President's got better
          things to do than come to my
          birthday party.

                    MAY
               (smiling)
          What?

     Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who,
     on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace.

                    ALLISON
          Daddy!

                    PARRISH
          Hi, Allison --

                    ALLISON
          Have you got a minute?

                    PARRISH
          Not much more.  Big day in the big
          city.  What's on your mind?

                    ALLISON
          Fireworks.  Update -- we're con-
          structing the number '65' on the
          barge, archers from the State
          College at New Paltz will shoot
          flaming arrows at it, when it
          catches fire it will give us the
          effect of a Viking funeral with none
          of the morbidity... The Hudson River
          Authority says, for you, they'll
          make a special dispensation - of
          course there'll be an overtime bill
          for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...

                    PARRISH
          Allison, I trust you.  This is your
          thing.

                    ALLISON
          But it's your birthday.

     Parrish smiles complaisantly, they continue on into a break-
     fast room where SUSAN, 30, Parrish's younger daughter, is
     grazing at a table laden with cereals and fruits and coffee.

                    SUSAN
          Good morning, Dad.

                    PARRISH
          Hi, honey.

                    ALLISON
               (to Susan)
          I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.

                    SUSAN
               (smiling)
          Drew called from the AStar, they're
          still two minutes away.

                    PARRISH
          Drew's aboard?

                    SUSAN
          He wanted to ride back down with
          you. Now sit and relax, get some-
          thing in that flat tummy of yours --

     But Parrish only pours coffee.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
               (to Allison)
          You coming?

                    ALLISON
          You've got patients waiting, I've
          got three hysterical chefs, one
          loves truffles, the other hates
          truffles, the third one doesn't know
          what truffles are.  I'd better drive
          down.

     Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing
     in intensity.

                    PARRISH
               (unconsciously)
          I hate parties --

                    ALLISON
          Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're
          going to love it.

                    PARRISH
          Isn't it enough to be on this earth
          sixty-five years without having to
          be reminded of it.

                    ALLISON
          No.

     Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting.

                    SUSAN
          Will you relax?  I know it is a big
          deal day --

                    PARRISH
          How did you know?

                    SUSAN
          Drew told me.

                    PARRISH
          Does Drew tell you everything?

                    SUSAN
          I hope so.

                    PARRISH
          You like him, don't you?

                    SUSAN
          Yeah.  I guess so.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          I don't like to interfere.

                    SUSAN
          ...Then don't.

     The helicopter CHOPS in overhead.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          -- Here comes our boy now --
          Shall we?

     EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING

     A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as
     led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter.  En route
     they pass QUINCE, 38, Allison's husband, who is perched at a
     portable bar with AMBROSE, the head caterer, tasting wines.

                    QUINCE
          ...This shit's not bad.

                    AMBROSE
          -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr.
          Quince, a possibility for dessert.

                    QUINCE
               (pointing to another
                bottle)
          And that?

                    AMBROSE
          Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it
          for the appetizer.

     Ambrose takes a sip, swishes the wine in his mouth, spits it
     in a bucket.

                    QUINCE
          What do you do that for?

                    AMBROSE
          Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.

                    QUINCE
          9:30's almost 10:30.  Where I come
          from, the sun's over the yardarm,
          m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.

     Quince drains his wine, presents it for a refill, when he is
     hailed by Allison.

                    ALLISON
          Quince!  Everybody's waiting!

     Quince downs this glass too, runs for the helicopter as
     DREW, 34, a young man going places, emerges from it,
     approaches Parrish and Susan.

                    DREW
               (to Susan)
          Hello, Beautiful.

                    SUSAN
          Hi.

     Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for
          coming out.

                    DREW
          Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to
          line up a few ducks before kickoff.
          Any thoughts?  Last minute refine-
          ments or variations?

                    PARRISH
          'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did
          hear a voice last night.

                    DREW
          A voice?

                    PARRISH
          In my sleep.

                    DREW
          What'd it say?

                    PARRISH
          'Yes'.

                    DREW
          'Yes' to the deal?

                    PARRISH
          Maybe, who knows?  You know how
          voices are.  Let's go.

     Quince comes running up now.

                    QUINCE
          Hi, Bill --

                    PARRISH
          Good morning, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          How're you doing--?

                    PARRISH
          I'm doing great.  You ready?

                    QUINCE
          I am, this is it.  B Day.

                    PARRISH
          How's that, Quince?

                    QUINCE
          Bontecou Day.  Going to close
          with Big John -- Look at you, Bill,
          all cool as a cat and over at
          Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting
          in his pants.

                    ALLISON
               (to Quince)
          Honey, please.

                    QUINCE
          Okay.  All aboard - New York, New
          York!

                    ALLISON
          Remember everybody, tonight, dinner
          in the city at Daddy's.  You too,
          Drew.  We've still got some loose
          ends --

                    PARRISH
          Not my birthday again?

                    SUSAN
          You're only six-five once.

                    PARRISH
          Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's
          get this day started.

     Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and
     Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him
     As Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors.

     INT. ASTAR HELICOPTER - DAY

     The configuration of seats has Drew beside Parrish, in front
     of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
     Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
     case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
     pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
     and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
     over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
     He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
     that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
     her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
     work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.

                    SUSAN
          I thought you were in a meeting--?

                    PARRISH
          I am.  With you.

     He peers up ahead at Drew, on the telephone and gesticulat-
     ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the CHOP
     of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Do you love Drew?

                    SUSAN
          ...There's a start for a meeting.

                    PARRISH
          I know it's none of my business --

     Susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her
     father on the cheek.

                    SUSAN
          No, it's none of your business.

     Another moment.

                    PARRISH
          Do you love Drew?

                    SUSAN
          You mean like you loved Mom?

                    PARRISH
          Forget about me and Mom -- are you
          going to marry him?

                    SUSAN
          Probably.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
               (smiles)
          Don't get carried away.

                    SUSAN
          Uh oh --

                    PARRISH
          Susan, you're a hell of a woman.
          You've got a great career, you're
          beautiful --

                    SUSAN
          And I'm your daughter and no man
          will ever be good enough for me.

                    PARRISH
          Well, I wasn't going to say that --

                    SUSAN
          What were you going to say?

                    PARRISH
          Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --
          He's smart, he's aggressive, he
          could carry Parrish Communications
          into the 21st century and me along
          with it.

                    SUSAN
          So what's wrong with that?

                    PARRISH
          That's for me.  I'm talking about
          you.  It's not so much what you say
          about Drew, it's what you don't say.

                    SUSAN
          You're not listening --

                    PARRISH
          Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of
          excitement, not a whisper of a
          thrill, this relationship has all
          the passion of a pair of titmice.

                    SUSAN
          Don't get dirty, Dad --

                    PARRISH
          Well, it worries me.  I want you
          to get swept away.  I want you to
          levitate.  I want you to sing with
          rapture and dance like a dervish.

                    SUSAN
          That's all?

                    PARRISH
          Be deliriously happy.  Or at least
          leave yourself open to be.

                    SUSAN
          'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going
          to do my upmost --

     He smiles.

                    PARRISH
          I know it's a cornball thing but
          love is passion, obsession, someone
          you can't live without.  If you
          don't start with that, what are you
          going to end up with?  I say fall
          head over heels.  Find someone you
          can love like crazy and who'll love
          you the same way back.  And how do
          you find him?  Forget your head and
          listen to your heart.  I'm not
          hearing any heart.
               (a moment)
          Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
          come back.  Because, the truth is
          there is no sense living your life
          without this.  To make the journey
          and not fall deeply in love -- well,
          you haven't lived a life at all.
          You have to try.  Because if you
          haven't tried, you haven't lived.

                    SUSAN
          Bravo.

                    PARRISH
          Aw, you're tough.

                    SUSAN
          I'm sorry.  But give it to me again.
          The short version.

                    PARRISH
          Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning
          could strike.

     Silence.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Forgive the lecture --

                    SUSAN
          I won't.  And when I tell Drew about
          it, he won't either.

                    PARRISH
          You won't tell him, and even if you
          did, he'd clock it and punch it into
          his laptop in order to pull out some
          key phrases when he gives the
          Commencement Speech at Wharton.

                    SUSAN
          You're terrible.

                    PARRISH
          I know.  But I'm the only father
          you've got.

     She kisses him on the cheek.

                    SUSAN
          Thank God.

                    PARRISH
          He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.

     EXT. 34TH STREET HELIPAD, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     The AStar lands, an attendant, waiting with a luggage cart,
     rushes to open the door and unload the bags.  The passengers,
     Parrish paired with Quince, Drew with Susan, file off the
     rooftop through a door which opens into an elevator.

     INT. ELEVATOR, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     Parrish, Susan, Drew and Quince face forward as they ride
     downwards.

                    QUINCE
          Hey, this is it, the hour approach-
          es, I'm getting all excited.  So
          what do you think, is it --
               (indicates Drew and
                Parrish)
          -- just the 'Executive Committee' or
          could you guys use me?

                    DREW
          Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer,
          but it's all set for just me and Bill.
          More people might --

                    QUINCE
          I know.  Gum up the works.

     Parrish is about to make some reassuring comment to Quince
     when the Voice suddenly intrudes:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          '...I know, it's none of my
          business.'

                    PARRISH
          What?

                    DREW
          I was saying to Quince we won't
          need --

                    PARRISH
          Did you just hear something?

                    DREW
          Why yes, Bill, I was saying to
          Quince --

                    PARRISH
          No no, not you.

                    SUSAN
          Daddy, what's the matter?

                    PARRISH
          Nothing.  I'm sorry.

     A respectful silence, the elevator continues downwards,
     suddenly the Voice intrudes again:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          '...I want you to levitate.  I want
          you to sing with rapture and dance
          like a dervish.'

     Parrish grunts bizarrely, Susan notices and reacts:

                    SUSAN
          What is it, Daddy --?

                    PARRISH
          Nothing.

     Parrish's eyes dart about, confirming no one has heard a
     thing but him.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Just talking to myself again.  You
          know me --

     The elevator door opens.

                    PARRISH
          Well, here we are --

     Parrish leads the group out.

     EXT. 34TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     They exit the building.

                    SUSAN
               (to Parrish)
          Are you okay?

                    PARRISH
          A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears
          pricked.  I'm ready for action.

                    SUSAN
          Well, go get 'em, Pops.

                    PARRISH
          Yer damn right.

     Parrish, followed by Drew, steps into a waiting limousine,
     Quince looks longingly after them.  Susan, blowing a kiss
     goodbye to her father, steps out into the street to hustle a
     cab.

     INT. LOBBY, BONTECOU WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

                    DREW
          ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo
          opportunity, you and Big John, it'll
          lead network news.  Okay so far?

                    PARRISH
          Sounds good.

                    DREW
          It's going to be great --

                    PARRISH
          Do you think I need a haircut?

                    DREW
          Bill, after this deal, you'll be
          able to afford one.

     Parrish smiles, they step into the elevator.

     INT. BONTECOU EXECUTIVE OFFICES - DAY

     Parrish and Drew emerge from the elevator, Parrish observing
     the overkill decor.

                    DREW
          Their PR guy asked me, what did I
          think Parrish Communications stood
          for, that's principle and ethics-
          wise?  I came up with something, but
          then it occurred to me, why don't I
          ask Bill?  What do you think?

     A moment, Parrish shrugs.

                    PARRISH
          Our first annual report, must be
          thirty-five years ago now, I owned
          two stations, I wrote down a state-
          ment of purpose, that one day you
          would wake up to a Parrish radio
          station, read a Parrish paper at
          breakfast, catch our news on tele-
          vision during the day, and go to bed
          with one of our books or magazines
          and you would always be told the
          truth and in the bargain, have a
          good time.

                    DREW
          That's great!  Wait 'til I show it
          to Bontecou.

     Drew opens a door, a conference room, a circle of top exec-
     utives, now stepping out from the group is a huge, white-
     haired man, JOHN BONTECOU, 55.

                    BONTECOU
          Bill, thanks for coming over...
               (to Drew)
          And how're you doing today, Drew?
               (to Parrish)
          You've got a firecracker here, the
          kid's really set the table.

                    PARRISH
          Good, good.  Glad to hear it.

               BONTECOU
          We've met before, y'know, that White
          House function, the President had
          you on his right and you know where
          I was?

                    PARRISH
          I'm sorry, I don't recall --

                    BONTECOU
          Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I
          want to come in from the outfield,
          bat cleanup like you have, learn the
          plush ropes --

                    PARRISH
          I thought you were buying my company.

                    BONTECOU
          Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy
          Parrish Communications.  I could pay
          for it, of course, but it would
          always have your imprint.

     Silence.  Parrish looks around at the circle of 'suits',
     Bontecou holding away.

                    PARRISH
          Well, that's very nice to hear.

     Drew nods excitedly.

     EXT. NEW YORK HOSPITAL CORNELL MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

     The busy medical community at 68th Street and New York Avenue.

     INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK AVENUE - DAY

     A thriving eatery diagonally across from the hospital's
     entrance, customers cheek-by-jowl as a pair of waiters
     juggle breakfasts served to a noisy throng of doctors,
     residents and interns.

     Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
     with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
     of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for
     the day; immediately she becomes aware of a man behind her
     speaking into the pay phone.

     An attractive YOUNG MAN, early 30's, a pair of suitcase at
     his feet, a raincoat slung over his shoulder.

                    YOUNG MAN
          ...Honey, you've got to go on...
          there's a time to sow and a time to
          reap, you sow now and forget about
          him... yeah, I liked him, I don't
          like him anymore... because you're
          my honey and anybody messes with you
          messes with me -- I'm on a plane in
          a minute... as soon as I get my
          phone in, you're my first call,
          that's a promise... where you going
          now?... good, hit the books, get that
          degree, one day we'll hang out a
          shingle together... you bet, honey...
          later.

     The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an
     overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the
     counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the
     breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take
     her eyes off him.  He senses her eyes, glances over, his
     cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Good morning, I was talking kind of
          loud there, sorry.

                    SUSAN
          Not at all.  It was fascinating.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating'
          about it?

                    SUSAN
          You and 'Honey'?

                    YOUNG MAN
          My kid sister.  She just broke up
          with her boyfriend and she's
          thinking about dropping out of
          law school.

                    SUSAN
          I'm sorry --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Nothing to be sorry about.  That's
          the way with men and women, isn't
          it?

                    SUSAN
          What's the way?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Nothing lasts.

                    SUSAN
          I agree --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Why?

                    SUSAN
          I was just being agreeable, now I've
          got to explain why?

                    YOUNG MAN
          I'm not trying to sharpshoot you,
          but that 'nothing lasts' stuff,
          that's what was the trouble with
          Honey's guy.  He was fooling around
          and Honey caught him at it.  One
          girlfriend wasn't enough for him.

                    SUSAN
          So you're a one-girl guy?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Damn right.  Looking for her right
          now.  Who knows?  You might be her.

     Susan laughs.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          Well, don't laugh.  I just arrived
          in town, got a new job -- I'm trying
          to get into this apartment.  You a
          doctor?

                    SUSAN
          How'd you know?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Everybody's a doctor around here.
          This apartment house is all green
          pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm
          waiting for to vacate is a doctor.
          What kind of doctor?

                    SUSAN
          Me?  Internal medicine.

     The Young Man smiles.

                    YOUNG MAN
          So if I needed a doctor, you could
          be it?

                    SUSAN
          I could be her.

                    YOUNG MAN
          'Her'.

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          Yes, I could.
               (a moment)
          I have an office in the hospital.

                    YOUNG MAN
          -- This is my lucky day.  I arrive
          in this big bad city and I not only
          find a doctor, a beautiful woman as
          well.

     Susan looks into her coffee.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          I'm sorry, you mind my saying that?

                    SUSAN
          Not at all.

                    YOUNG MAN
          How 'bout another cup of coffee?

                    SUSAN
          I've got patients coming in --

                    YOUNG MAN
          And I want to get into my apartment
          and go to work.  Please, what do you
          say, another cup of coffee?

     Two pots are warming behind the counter, he reaches over and
     refills her cup and his.  Pushes a container and pitcher to-
     wards her.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          I see you use lots of sugar and
          cream.  Me, too...

     They smile at each other, fix up their coffee.

     EXT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     A magnificent granite building, a monument to good taste in
     the midtown sea of glass and aluminum.

     INT. OUTER LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     Parrish and Drew enter, no particular fanfare but an aware-
     ness the 'Chief' has arrived, everyone giving Parrish the
     appropriate wide berth, Drew right beside him.

                    DREW
          I'm all excited --

                    PARRISH
          Me, too.

                    DREW
          I thought it was great, I thought
          you and Big John would be like a
          couple of bulls in a china shop --
               (faltering)
          Instead it was --

                    PARRISH
          Like a marriage made in heaven?

                    DREW
          You have a way with words.

     They stride to the main bank of elevators.

     INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICES, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     Parrish, Drew beside him, proceeds through a high tech, but
     tasteful, maze, spiffy executive secretaries at burnished
     desks.  Neither looking right or left, somehow Parrish man-
     ages to acknowledge their bright smiles and deferential nods
     despite his swift entrance.

     He passes through an open set of doors and he is into his
     own suite, commanded by JENNIFER, his assistant.

                    JENIFER
          Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          Hi, Jennifer.

     Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at
     the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this
     is as far as he goes without being invited.

                    DREW
          So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll
          recommend, we close and it's a deal,
          right?

                    PARRISH
          As close as a deal could be.

                    DREW
               (bursting)
          Olympic.

     Parrish disappears into his office.  Drew, on his way out,
     glides past Jennifer's desk.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          This is our lucky day.

     Jennifer acknowledges Drew with a smile, rises and moves to
     Parrish's doorway, waiting for the day's instructions, but
     Parrish only nods to the door and Jennifer quickly closes
     it, returns to her desk.

     INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alone in his office, Parrish's ebullient mood immediately
     changes.  Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares
     out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the
     Manhattan skyline: cogitates.

     He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he
     flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp
     but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
     ignores it.

     Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
     pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
     massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,
     trying to shake it off, but it refuses to go away, some-
     thing is unmistakably wrong.  Now a SOUND which he has
     come to recognize, makes itself heard:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          Yes.

     Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the
     source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction,
     yet surrounds him.  Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply
     intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a
     corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other
     clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently
     seized the upper part of his body.  He breaks out in a sweat,
     his pallor now waxen as the Voice repeats itself:

                    VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
          ...Yes.

     Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him
     on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer,
     each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself,
     consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a
     hallucination but which he is certain is not.  Parrish is
     possessed.  He angles his face in every direction, arbi-
     trarily chooses one and now embarrassedly, unconsciously,
     enrage, responds to the Voice.

                    PARRISH
          'Yes' what?

                    VOICE
          'Yes' is the answer to your
          question.

                    PARRISH
          I didn't ask any question.

                    VOICE
          I believe you did.

     Parrish is absolutely confounded, seized up with pain and
     consternation at this unseen Voice which has such presence
     and reality.

                    PARRISH
          Who are you?

     Silence.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Goddammit, what is going on?!

                    VOICE
          I think you know --

                    PARRISH
          I don't!

                    VOICE
          Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried,
          you haven't lived'.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          What are you talking about?

                    VOICE
          What you were talking about.

     Parrish gasps.

                    PARRISH
          What is this?  Who is this fucking
          guy?

     He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping,
     his skin ashen.  Now he addresses the Voice again, searching
     for it in another direction:

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Tell me who you are!

                    VOICE
          Are you giving me orders?

                    PARRISH
          I'm sorry, I --

                    VOICE
          No, you're not.  You're trying to
          'handle' the situation but this is
          the one situation you knew you never
          could handle.

     A spasm, the worst one yet, finally it subsides and there is
     an eerie silence in the room, a VOID, almost more disturbing
     than the voice that has filled it.

                    PARRISH
          Where are you?  Are you there?

                    VOICE
          It's enough now.

                    PARRISH
          Please.  Talk to me --

                    VOICE
          There's going to be plenty of time
          for that.

                    PARRISH
          What do you mean?!

                    VOICE
          I think you know --

                    PARRISH
          Know what?
               (a moment)
          Know what, goddammit!

     The VOICE is gone.  Parrish searches the corner, but the
     room has lost the quality it had when it was inhabited by
     the VOICE, it is now just Parrish's office.  Faint SQUEALS of
     traffic from the street, then a KNOCK at the door.

     Parrish touches his shoulder, the pain is gone, but he is
     still wet with sweat, the KNOCK again.  Parrish straightens
     himself up, adjusts his tie, runs his fingers through his
     hair, blinks as he addresses the door.

                    PARRISH
               (carefully)
          Come in.

     Jennifer enters.

                    JENIFER
          I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish.
          Are you all right?

                    PARRISH
          Sure.

                    JENIFER
          Lunch is 'in' today, have you given
          it any thought --_

                    PARRISH
               (interrupting)
          No.  Nothing.

                    JENIFER
          Nothing?

     Parrish is within himself, doesn't answer.

                    JENIFER (cont'd)
          Why don't I think of something?

     Parrish still doesn't answer, however Jennifer is satisfied,
     correctly hearing his silence as an affirmative.  She has her
     hand on the door, 'Open' or 'Closed'?  He nods and she closes it.
     Utter silence again.  Parrish's eyes search the room, nothing
     there.

     INT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE, DAY

     The place has cleared out now, the counterman busy bussing
     tables laden with dishes and cups, Susan and the Young Man
     are still at the counter, but about to leave.

                    YOUNG MAN
          ...It's kind of a pro bono job.

                    SUSAN
          'Pro bono'.  That means doing good
          -- Going to be doing good all your
          life?

                    YOUNG MAN
          I know what you're saying.  Doesn't
          pay very well.  Depends on the woman
          I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger
          house, a better car, lotsa kids,
          college doesn't come cheap --

                    SUSAN
          You'd give up what you want for the
          woman you marry?

                    YOUNG MAN
          I would.

     Susan rises now, the Young Man with her, leaving money for
     their checks they head for the door.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          If I married you, I'd want to give
          you what you wanted, I know it's
          old fashioned and all that, but
          what's wrong with taking care of a
          woman?  She takes care of you.

                    SUSAN
          You'll have a hard time finding a
          woman like that these days --

                    YOUNG MAN
          You never know.  Lightning could
          strike.

     Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the
     Young Man.

     EXT. CORINTH COFFEE SHOP, YORK AVENUE - DAY

     The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out
     onto the street.

     Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and
     vulnerable.

                    SUSAN
          I've got to go --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Did I say something wrong?

                    SUSAN
          No, it was so right it scares me.

                    YOUNG MAN
          I've been thinking... I don't want
          you to be my doctor.  Because I
          don't want you to examine me.

                    SUSAN
          Why?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Because I like you so much.
               (a moment)
          You have coffee here every morning,
          don't you?  If I came by, could you
          give me the name of a doctor?

     Another moment.

                    SUSAN
          Sure, I'll give you the name of a
          doctor.
               (a moment)
          ...And I don't want to examine you.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Why not?

                    SUSAN
          Because I like you so much.  Now
          I've got to go.

     She hurries away down the sidewalk, the Young Man watching
     her.  Now he turns and starts off in the opposite direction.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - SUSAN

     She looks back at the Young Man, then turns and walks on.

     ANOTHER ANGLE - THE YOUNG MAN

     He looks back at Susan as the distance between them widens,
     now he turns and walks on.

     ON SUSAN

     She looks around once more but the Young Man is still headed
     in the opposite direction, his back to her.  She turns the
     corner and continues on.

     ON THE YOUNG MAN

     Approaching the corner, he looks back for Susan yet again,
     but she is gone, still turned he steps off into the street
     and a hospital supplies truck, speeding down the curb lane,
     HITS HIM BROADSIDE, a horrific impact, the THUD echoes as
     his body arcs through the air.

     Another sickening THUD as it lands, the Young Man lies
     crumpled, still.

                              CUT TO:

     INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

     A beautiful space adjacent to the dining room, it has a
     glass roof which offers a superb view of the Manhattan sky-
     line.  The hour is before dinner: gathered on one side of
     the room are Allison and Parrish, on the other side Drew and
     Quince.  COYLE, a butler, and LUISA, the housekeeper, pass
     hors d'oeuvres and drinks.

                    ALLISON
          ...Music, I know how you love music,
          Daddy, and I want to have music that
          pleases you -- and of course doesn't
          put a thousand other people to sleep
          -- I've agonized over this and
          finally settled on Sidney Brown,
          twenty-four men, very eclectic, plus
          I'm feathering in a Latin sextet on
          their breaks - Tito Puente, Trini
          Lopez-zy, I forget their names --

     Parrish has tuned Allison out, he tried to stay with it, but
     his mind has wandered, the event of the day too much with
     him.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          You haven't heard a word, have you?
          I keep talking and all you do is nod
          like Mr. Himmelfass in The
          Nutcracker.

     Parrish still doesn't answer.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          You don't care, do you?

                    PARRISH
          What, honey?

                    ALLISON
          I lay awake nights in a cold sweat,
          I want this party to be like some-
          thing Mom would have made for you,
          I want it to be perfect --

                    PARRISH
               (attentive now)
          I know you do, darling.

                    ALLISON
          And you could care less --

                    PARRISH
          Oh, you couldn't be more wrong,
          sweetheart.  I can' tell you how
          much I appreciate it and how I'm
          looking forward to it.

                    ALLISON
          Good.  Songs.  What songs should
          Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we
          can forget about -- what songs do
          you think he should play?

     A stab of pain, Parrish discreetly grabs his upper arm but
     manages to keep his attention on Allison.

                    PARRISH
          Tell it to me again.

     Suddenly, the Voice cuts in:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          ...Yes.

     Parrish's head snaps, startled by the SOUND.

                    VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
               (to Parrish)
          Did you miss me?

     Parrish reacts once more, aware again he is the only one who
     has heard the Voice, as an oblivious Allison continues:

                    ALLISON
               (to Parrish)
          Never mind.  Leave it to me.

     Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the
     Voice.  His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful.

               LUISA
          Mr. Parrish, dinner is served.

                    ALLISON
               (to Quince and Drew,
                across the room)
          Chow-time, you guys.

     Parrish is confounded.  Blindly and disconcerted, he follows
     Allison and Drew and Quince.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     As a disturbed Parrish approaches the table, he hears the
     Voice once more:

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          What are you looking so provoked
          about?  'Did you miss me?'  It's
          a normal question.  I missed you.
          But what do I get back?  'Not an
          ounce of excitement, not a whisper
          of a thrill --'

     Parrish sits.

                    VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
          '-- This relationship has all the
          passion of a pair of titmice'.

     Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his
     panic.

                    VOICE (V.O., cont'd)
          I'm waiting outside.

     The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it:

                    ALLISON
               (to Drew)
          Did you speak to the Governor?

                    DREW
          He's coming.

                    ALLISON
          His wife?

                    DREW
          Unfortunately.  I sat between them
          at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was
          better than Seconal.

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          I'm waiting outside.  Won't someone
          come to the door?

     Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of
     himself.  As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa:

                    PARRISH
          Is somebody waiting outside, Luisa?

                    LUISA
          I didn't hear a ring, sir.

                    PARRISH
          Please have a look --

     Luisa goes as Coyle continues serving.

                    ALLISON
               (to Quince)
          What about the Mayor?

                    QUINCE
          He said he would be there with bells
          on.

                    DREW
          Good, maybe they'll drown him out.

     Parrish is still not hearing a word, preoccupied with the
     return of Luisa.

                    ALLISON
          Please don't be negative, Drew, we
          have an acceptance list that would
          do The White House proud -- The
          Secretary-General of the UN, the
          Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators,
          I don't know how many Congressmen,
          and at least twelve of the Fortune
          '500'.

                    QUINCE
          No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a
          Masters champion?  Someone I could
          talk to.
               (a moment)
          Or would talk to me.

     Luisa returns to Parrish as the others' conversation drones
     on:

                    LUISA
          You're right, Mr. Parrish.  There
          was a gentleman at the door.  He's
          waiting for you in the foyer.

     Parrish is stunned.

                    PARRISH
               (after a moment)
          Show him into the library, tell him
          I'll be right there.

     Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage
     to go as Allison continues:

                    ALLISON
          I've arranged for favors -- silver
          charm bracelets for the women,
          platinum keychains for the men --
          all engraved 'W.P.' -- but now I'm
          thinking of scrubbing them, they
          seem so ordinary.

     Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          Are they ordinary?  Do they seem
          that way to you, Daddy?

                    PARRISH
          Uh -- I don't know.  No - uh - I
          don't...

     Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into
     disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room.

                    DREW
               (to Allison)
          You're overthinking it --

                    QUINCE
          I don't think they're ordinary.  I
          love keychains.

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears
     the doorway to the library.  The door is open.  He hesitates
     before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his
     eye can see, now tentatively, he enters.

     INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club
     chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library
     ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat
     carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from
     the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured
     glass.

     Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in
     sight.

                    PARRISH
          Hello?

     Silence.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Anyone here?

     No response.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I said is anyone here?!

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          Quiet down.

     Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his
     eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch
     of which is exactly what he has heard before.  There is the
     sense that someone is there but Parrish cannot see him, and
     he does not dare look.

                    PARRISH
               (quietly)
          Where are you?

                    VOICE (V.O.)
          I'm here.

     Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured
     glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish,
     there is a shape.  Something is there.

                    PARRISH
          What is this, a joke, right?  Some
          kind of elaborate practical joke?
          At my 40th reunion, we delivered a
          casket to the Class president's
          hotel room and --

                    VOICE
          Quiet.

     Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the
     Voice muting him.  He takes a step backwards.

                    VOICE (cont'd)
          Where are you going?

                    PARRISH
          I - I - uh --

     The shape moves, makes itself more visible.  Although still
     diffused by the glass, the shape has definition, a person, a
     man, his features are not yet distinguishable, but he is
     there all right.

                    VOICE
          The great Bill Parrish at a loss for
          words?  The man from whose lips fall
          'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses-
          sion'...all those admonitions about
          being 'deliberately happy', what
          there is no sense 'living your life
          without...', all the sparks and
          energy you give off, the rosy advice
          you dispense in round, pear-shaped
          tones --

                    PARRISH
          What the hell is this?  Who are you?

                    VOICE
          Just think of millenniums multiplied
          by aeons compounded by infinity,
          I've been around that long, but it's
          only recently that your affairs here
          have piqued my interest.  Call it
          boredom, the natural curiosity of
          me, the most lasting and significant
          element in existence has come to see
          you.

     Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing.

                    PARRISH
          About what?

                    VOICE
          I want to have a look around before
          I take you.

                    PARRISH
          'Take me'...?  Where?

                    VOICE
          It requires competence, wisdom,
          experience -- all those things they
          say about you in testimonials --
          and you're the one.

                    PARRISH
          'The one' to do what?

                    VOICE
          Show me around.  Be my guide.  And
          in return, you get...

                    PARRISH
               (breathless)
          Get what?

                    VOICE
          Time.

                    PARRISH
          What the hell are you talking about?

                    VOICE
          Watch it!

                    PARRISH
          I'm sorry --

                    VOICE
          In return you'll receive minuets, days,
          weeks, I'm not going to go into details
          ... what matters is that I stay
          interested.

     Parrish squints, trying to make sense of what is happening.

                    VOICE (cont'd)
          ...'Yes'.

                    PARRISH
          Yes what?

                    VOICE
          'Yes' is the answer to your ques-
          tion.

                    PARRISH
          What question?

                    VOICE
          Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The
          question you've been asking yourself
          with increased regularity, at odd
          moments, panting through the extra
          game of handball, when you ran for
          the plane in Delhi, when you sat up
          in bed last night and hit the floor
          in the office this morning.  The
          question that is in the back of your
          throat, choking the blood to your
          brain, ringing in the ears over and
          over as you put it to yourself --

                    PARRISH
          The 'question' --

                    VOICE
               (urging)
          Yes, Bill.  The question.

     After a moment.

                    PARRISH
          ...Am I going to die?

     The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no
     longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, re-
     vealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the
     coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, off-
     center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Yes.

     A moment, Parrish beside himself.  He cannot bring himself
     to speak, finally:

                    PARRISH
          Am I dreaming this?
               (Another moment)
          Are you a dream?

                    YOUNG MAN
          I am not a dream.

                    PARRISH
          You're coming to 'take me'.  What is
          that?  Who the hell are you?

     The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches
     from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man
     daring Parrish to identify him:

                    PARRISH
          You are --?

                    YOUNG MAN
                 (urging again)
          '...Yes --'

     Parrish turns away.  But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in
     front of him again.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
               (gently)
          Who am I?

                    PARRISH
          ...Death.

     Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what
     he has comprehended.  He surveys the Young Man who, at this
     moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          You're Death?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Yes.

                    PARRISH
          Death!

                    YOUNG MAN
          That's me.

                    PARRISH
          You're not Death.  You're just a kid
          in a jacket and a pair of pants.

                    YOUNG MAN
          The jacket and the pair of pants
          came with the body I took.  Let me
          ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?

     A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment.

                    PARRISH
          You want me to be your guide --?

                    YOUNG MAN
          You fill the bill, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          I do?
               (a moment)
          How long will you be staying?

                    YOUNG MAN
          You should hope quite a while.

                    PARRISH
          And then --?

     The Young Man nods, gently.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          It's... it's... over.

     A long silence.  Parrish and the Young Man take each other in,
     the sense that now they understand each other.  A SOUND at the
     door.

                    LUISA (O.S.)
          Mr. Parrish?

     Parrish does not hear her for the moment, Luisa steps inside
     the Library.

                    LUISA (cont'd)
          Will the gentleman be staying for
          dinner, sir?

     Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then
     at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to
     verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by
     Luisa.  The Young Man interjects:

                    YOUNG MAN
               (to Luisa)
          Yes.
               (a polite afterthought)
          Thank you.

     Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits.  Parrish is frozen,
     dumbfounded.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
               (to Parrish)
          Where is dinner?

     Parrish does not answer at first.

                    PARRISH
          This is crazy -- you're not going to
          eat dinner with us.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Bill, I am eating dinner with you.
          And your family.  And that's what
          we're doing.  It's not open for
          discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't
          you understand?

     Parrish is frightened by the response.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          Good.  Now lead the way.

     Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out
     of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer.

                    PARRISH
          Excuse me?  Could I say something?

                    YOUNG MAN
          Of course.

                    PARRISH
               (quietly)
          It just occurred to me --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Speak up, please.

                    PARRISH
               (louder)
          When I introduce you, if I say who
          you are, I don't think anyone will
          stay for dinner.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Then don't.

     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the
     background.

                    ALLISON
          ...Well, here's another possibility.
          It's a little last minute, but how does
          this strike you?  Kaleidoscopes. Little
          gold kaleidoscopes.  Some German firm
          went kerplunkt, Tiffany's picked these
          things up, they're perfect party favors,
          however they're not personal, they're
          winter scene or something, snow-flakes
          and dachshunds...

     Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward
     pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family
     dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully survey-
     ed.  Finally, Allison breaks the ice:

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
               (to the Young Man)
          Hi there --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Hello.

     Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at
     each person as if he were discovering a face of the first
     time.

                    PARRISH
          Uh -- sorry -- to have stepped away
          for so long -- uh -- this is a
          friend of mine I asked to drop by --
          we got to talking and stuff -- uh --
          he's going to join us for dinner --
          um --

     Parrish drifts into another awkward pause.

                    ALLISON
               (to the Young Man)
          Hello, how nice to meet you.  And
          wouldn't it be nicer if my father
          would introduce you?

                    YOUNG MAN
               (to Allison)
          '...How nice to meet you.'

                    PARRISH
          Oh, I'm sorry.  This is my daughter,
          Allison, and her husband, Quince,
          Drew, my number one, works with me...

     Parrish drifts off as the Young Man awkwardly shakes hands
     with each person.

                    ALLISON
               (prompting)
          Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?

                    PARRISH
          A name?

                    DREW
               (pleasantly, going
                along with the joke)
          Yeah, something he goes by --

                    PARRISH
          Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh --
          this is --

                    ALLISON
          Daddy!  Come on, a name.

                    DREW
          Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing
          me.

                    PARRISH
          Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone
          right out of my head --

                    DREW
          What?!

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I'm sorry.  This is - uh - uh...

     The group waits patiently.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Joe!

                    ALLISON
          Joe...

     Parrish once more drifts into silence.  (The YOUNG MAN is now
     identified as "JOE".)

                    DREW
          Just plain 'Joe'?

                    ALLISON
          Love that name.

                    QUINCE
          Me, too.  Hey, buddy!

     Joe, turned on by Quince's broad smile, reacts to it as Drew
     squints observingly at Joe.

                    DREW
          'Joe...'

                    PARRISH
          Yes.

                    DREW
          Is there any more to it?

                    PARRISH
               (alarmed)
          What do you mean?

                    DREW
          Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'

     Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name,
     a furtive glance at Joe.  Parrish's brow darkens and a name
     tumbles from his lips:

                    PARRISH
          -- Black.

                    ALLISON
          Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you,
          Mr. Black.

                    QUINCE
          'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost
          two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in
          1952.

                    JOE
          Yes?

                    QUINCE
               (to Joe)
          You bet.  I'm kind of my Rotisserie
          League.

                    JOE
          Are you?

                    PARRISH
          He is!  Let's sit down --

     Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which
     was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned.
     Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his uten-
     sils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at
     his foot.

                    ALLISON
               (to Joe)
          Paillarde of veal.

                    QUINCE
          Yeah, they hit the calf over the
          head with a mallet and then Luisa
          hits it again in the kitchen.

                    ALLISON
          Honey --!

                    QUINCE
          You know what I'm saying, Joe?

                    JOE
          No --

                    PARRISH
               (laughing emptily)
          Joe knows what you're saying, just
          being polite --

     Drew is studying Joe.

                    DREW
               (to Joe)
          Have we met?

                    PARRISH
          Uh -- he's from out of town --

                    QUINCE
          How long you here, Joe?

                    JOE
          As long as it takes.

     Drew is provoked by the response, but remains polite:

                    DREW
          You and Bill old friends?

     Parrish jumps in:

                    PARRISH
          No --

                    DREW
               (to Joe)
          I get the feeling you've done some
          business before.

                    JOE
          We have an arrangement now.

                    DREW
          What side of the industry did you
          say you were on?

                    JOE
          I didn't say.

                    DREW
               (to Parrish)
          Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I
          have the feeling you guys got the
          broad strokes already.  Need any
          help with the details?

     Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          I'm sorry -- business at dinner...
               (to Joe)
          Forgive me for being so rude.

                    JOE
          Sure.

     The doors to the dining room open, Susan appears.

                    SUSAN
          Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -
          had to have dinner with my depart-
          ment chief --

                    ALLISON
          You ate?

                    SUSAN
          ...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't
          miss a loose end meeting.  What's on
          the table for discussion?  Party
          favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --

     She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have ob-
     viously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water
     toys and their lips meeting mid-air.

     At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is
     present and has been watching.  She is shocked, embarrassed,
     pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          What are you doing here?

     Silence.

                    PARRISH
               (stunned)
          You know each other?

                    SUSAN
               (lightly)
          We've met.

                    PARRISH
          What?!

                    SUSAN
          -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee
          Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.

                    QUINCE
          Well, I guess he's found one.

                    DREW
          Joe, you do get around.

     Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction.

                    SUSAN
          That's your name?

                    ALLISON
          And isn't it a lovely one?  So
          sturdy, so straight --

     Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her,
     doesn't answer.

                    DREW
          Incidentally, Joe, where're you
          staying?

                    JOE
          Here...

                    DREW
          'Here'?

                    SUSAN
          In this house?

                    QUINCE
          Great!

     Parrish pushes his plate away.

                    PARRISH
          Uh - will that hold you, Joe?

                    SUSAN
          Incidentally, 'Joe' what?

                    JOE
          Black.

                    QUINCE
          Hey, this is fun.

                    SUSAN
          So, what are you doing here?

     Parrish tenses, but Joe doesn't answer.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Cat got your tongue?  You weren't so
          silent this morning.

     Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy.

                    ALLISON
          Now, I'm getting interested.  I want
          to know more ---

                    PARRISH
               (to Joe)
          We've got some things to discuss.

     Parrish stands, motions for Joe to rise.

                    DREW
               (to Joe)
          -- Did I hear 'business'?

                    SUSAN
          What 'business'?

                    QUINCE
          Don't bother asking, we already
          tried.

                    JOE
          It's so very nice to see you again.

                    SUSAN
          Funny, I don't get that feeling.
          Maybe it's because you found out
          I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.

                    PARRISH
          Cut it out, Susan.
               (to Joe)
          You and I've got to talk.  Big day
          tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.

     Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops:

                    JOE
               (to Susan)
          Susan.
               (to Allison)
          Allison.
               (to Quince)
          Quince.
               (to Drew)
          Drew.
               (to Parrish)
          Bill...
               (to the group)
          Thank you.

     He makes an awkward little bow, then heads for the nearest
     door.

                    PARRISH
          Joe, that's the kitchen.

                    JOE
          Thank you.

     Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door.

                    DREW
          That was 'Joe'.

                    ALLISON
          He's cute.

                    DREW
          Very.

     Susan's eyes are still on the door where Joe exited, her
     face reflecting her irritation and bewilderment, as well as
     a tinge of excitement.

     INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Parrish leads the way, Joe beside him as they progress through
     the huge house.

                    PARRISH
          ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon-
          certed, that stuff between you and
          Susan -- uh -- threw me.

                    JOE
          'Threw' you?  Where?

                    PARRISH
          Shook me up.  I mean that you knew
          her and everything --

                    JOE
          I didn't know her.  The body I took
          knew her.  The man she met in the
          coffee shop this morning.  I - uh -
          took him.

                    PARRISH
          So there's nothing between you and
          Susan?

                    JOE
          No.

                    PARRISH
          I wish you had said something to me
          about staying here --

                    JOE
          It hadn't occurred to me until then.
          I was just having such a wonderful
          time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm
          here for?

     Parrish suddenly looks very anxious, Joe stops.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          You seem uncomfortable, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          No, I'm okay with this - uh - I
          think.  So --

     He opens a door.

     INT. MASTER GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

                    PARRISH
               (to Joe)
          Bathroom...tub...towels, sauna --

     Parrish turns back to the bedroom.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          ...Chair, lamp, bed --

     Parrish is in a stunned state, chatters on unconsciously:

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Box springs, they're assembled in
          Jakarta.  Had to stay in a station
          manager's house there unexpectedly
          - best night's sleep I ever had.
          Ordered twenty, they filled a con-
          tainer and shipped them right over,
          I've put one in every bedroom here
          and in the country.

     Joe tests the springs.

                    JOE
          What a good idea.

                    PARRISH
          Thank you.  Would you like the man's
          name?

                    JOE
          No.

     Parrish glances around, a room in which the occupant could
     not want for anything.

                    PARRISH
          If there is anything else, don't
          hesitate --

                    JOE
          I won't.

                    PARRISH
          How long have I got?

                    JOE
          You're putting me on the spot, Bill.

     A moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Let's put it this way.  When I go,
          you go.

                    PARRISH
          When you go, I go.

                    JOE
          That's the best I can do.
               (a moment)
          ...but minute-by-minute, I find
          myself lingering.

                    PARRISH
          ...I just saw my doctor, he told me
          everything was fine.

                    JOE
          Your doctor?
               (icily)
          Did your doctor say anything about
          a tiny, undetectable hole in your
          aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab-
          ly weak vein in the further reaches
          of your famous brain?  Were they any
          prognostications about the possibil-
          ilites of a fatal collision on a golf
          cart of suffocating in an avalanche
          on a skin vacation in Gstaad?

                    PARRISH
          No --

                    JOE
          I hope you realize, Bill...in your
          office this morning, that was your
          time.

                    PARRISH
          Closer than that.

     Parrish keeps still, trying to cool the heat of Joe's
     temper.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          ...But meanwhile, you are still
          here.  Count your blessings.  Call
          it gravy, frosting on the cake,
          whatever it is you say.

                    PARRISH
          Well, thank you for letting me know.

                    JOE
          Not at all.

                    PARRISH
          And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.

                    JOE
          Good night to you, Bill.

     Parrish gently closes the door.

     Joe looks around, checks out his surroundings: curious,
     attentive.

     INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Parrish, unsteady, starts back down the hall, Luisa appears.

                    LUISA
          ...Miss Allison asked if you would
          like to have your dinner kept warm?

                    PARRISH
          No. Thanks, Luisa.

                    LUISA
          Very good, sir.

     Luisa turns:

                    PARRISH
          Luisa --

     She stops.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Mr. Black's luggage was misplaced by
          the airlines.  Would you mind get-
          ting a few things together for him?
          A couple of suits, some shirts,
          ties, underwear, shoes.  Have Coyle
          take his measurements off what he is
          wearing tonight.

                    LUISA
          Certainly, sir.

     Luisa nods, and heads back downstairs.  Parrish enters
     his den, takes a seat in his chair, stares into the middle
     distance, ruminates.

     INT. GUEST ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Joe has been examining his room, full of curiosity and
     wonderment at the oddest things, the handle on a casement
     window, the hem and weight of the fabric of a drape, hinges
     on the bedroom door.  In the process he opens this door,
     steps out into the hallway.

     INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Joe wanders down the hallway past the occasional Dufy or
     Miro, a Venetian tapestry cheek-by-jowl with a miniature
     Ming vae, and even a Bonsai garden with a trickling vein
     of water.

     INT. KITCHEN HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     In the "back" of the house now, utilitarian paint and decor,
     the SOUND of laughter and a glare of light.  Joe enters.

     INT. KITCHEN, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     The staff is at ease, some smoking, remains of food around.
     Coyle, the butler, has his back to Joe and does not see him
     for a moment.  In front of Coyle, an open jar of peanut but-
     ter which he is spreading in generous hunks of Wonder Bread.
     Joe is fascinated by the process.  Coyle suddenly hears the
     silence, looks up and see Joe, standing up embarrassedly.

                    COYLE
          Yes, sir?

                    JOE
          Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet
          you.

                    COYLE
          Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.

     The staff all mumble expansive "Good evening, sir"s to Joe.
     He motions to them to sit, they do but Coyle does not.  Coyle
     shifts from foot-to-foot, the staff is not used to having
     Parrish family or guests in this part of the house.

                    JOE
               (to Coyle)
          What are you eating.

                    COYLE
          You mean this, sir?

     Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly.

                    COYLE (cont'd)
          Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter.

                    JOE
               (carefully)
          'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.
               (a moment)
          You like it?

                    COYLE
          I would say, sir, it is right up
          there with Jif and Skippy.  But
          miles ahead of Peter Pan.
               (another moment)
          Like a taste?

     Joe nods, Coyle fashions a spoonful, offers it to Joe.  Joe
     swallows it.  But he has not yet found a comfortable way of
     masticating, his mouth and tongue go every which way, the
     staff observes him, fascinated.

                    COYLE (cont'd)
          You're a peanut butter man now, eh,
          sir?

                    JOE
          Yes, I am.  I thoroughly enjoyed
          this - uh - peanut butter.
               (to the staff)
          And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting
          you.

     Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast
     to the staff.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          I'll be moseying on.

     He heads out, with the spoonful of peanut butter, to cheer-
     ful "Goodnight, Mr. Black"'s, his tongue again licking the
     edges of the spoon.

     INT. SWIMMING POOL, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

     A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views
     of the skyline.

     Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black
     Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter.
     He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as
     she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection
     from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.

                    SUSAN
          What are you doing here?

                    JOE
          I'm lost.

                    SUSAN
          -- Can't seem to escape you today.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry.

     Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder,
     points to a stack of towels.

                    SUSAN
          Hand me one of those, will you?

     Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the
     spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand,
     can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants
     the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and
     presents it to Susan.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          You must have something really big
          going on with my father --

                    JOE
          'Big'?

                    SUSAN
          You appear at his side out-of-the-
          blue, stay at his house, eat dinner
          with his family, it's practically a
          first.  You're in the red-hot center
          of big business and I thought you
          were a regular Joe.

                    JOE
          I am Joe.

                    SUSAN
          Not the one I met this morning, hit-
          ting on me in as nice a way as I've
          been hit on in a long time, but the
          moment you find out I'm my Dad's
          daughter, you act like a stranger.

                    JOE
          That is not my intention.

     Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.

                    SUSAN
          What are your intentions?  To make
          little dreams in coffee shops, turn
          a woman's head, and I don't mind
          admitting it was turned, I liked it,
          but ten hours later I feel like a
          fool.  I don't get it.  You, my
          father, here in this house, the cof-
          fee shop, it's making me upset, and
          I don't like being upset.  Who are
          you anyway?  And what are you eating?

                    JOE
               (mumbles)
          Peanut butter.

     He finishes the spoonful.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          But it's gone now.

     He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in
     his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate.  Susan holds her
     hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the
     spoon on the table with the towels.  She watches, fascinat-
     ed, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his
     spoonful.

                    SUSAN
          You act like you never had peanut
          butter before --

                    JOE
          I haven't.

                    SUSAN
          -- What kind of childhood did you
          have?

                    JOE
          Do you love Drew?

                    SUSAN
          Come again?

                    JOE
          When you put your mouth to his,
          Susan, it seems a frequent thing.

                    SUSAN
          Drew is none of your damn business.
          Nor is where I put my mouth.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry.  Do you live here?

                    SUSAN
          No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then
          I'm going home.

                    JOE
          I guess what I'm trying to say is --
          I'd like us to be friends.

                    SUSAN
          I've got plenty of friends.

                    JOE
          I don't have any.

                    SUSAN
          I can see why.

     She finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and
     prepares to leave.

                    JOE
          ...I didn't mean to offend you at
          dinner.  I'm not quite at home some-
          times with people.  I get busy doing
          - uh - what I do, and I don't seem to
          have developed --

     He drifts off.

                    SUSAN
          Yes --?

                    JOE
          I have a certain function to per-
          form, and that seems to take all
          of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh -
          I speculate - uh - I haven't left
          room for - uh - anything else.

                    SUSAN
          I'm sorry to say I know what you're
          saying.

     A moment.

                    JOE
          Susan?

                    SUSAN
          Yes?

                    JOE
          Did you know you have a wet spot on
          your shoulder?

     She glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the
     drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel.  She
     flashes a nervous smile.

                    SUSAN
          Goodnight, Joe.

                    JOE
          Goodnight to you, Susan.

     Susan steps towards a door, Joe takes a step in the wrong
     direction, they almost walk into each other.  Now she takes
     a step in another direction, as does Joe, again they almost
     collide.

                    SUSAN
          Shall we dance?

     Joe is completely puzzled, finally Susan heads for one door,
     Joe for another.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Joe --

                    JOE
          Yes?

                    SUSAN
          I think you want to go to the west
          wing.  Through there.

     Susan indicates yet another door.

                    JOE
               (after a moment)
          Thank you.

     Joe redirects himself, goes to the door.  As they both are
     about to exit, Joe and Susan sneak furtive looks at each
     other across the pool, smile at catching each other's
     glances.  Joe exits.  For a moment Susan's eyes remain on
     the door through which he has gone.  Now she grips the towel
     over her shoulders, the one Joe gave her, pats the same spot
     he did.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NEXT MORNING

     Parrish, dressed for the day, passes servants busy with
     their morning tasks, polishing doorknobs, putting away
     linen, dusting picture frames.  He nods and greets them as
     he strides down the hall, brisk "Good morning"'s to Coyle
     and Luisa.

     INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - MORNING

     Parrish knocks, waits a courteous moment, opens the door,
     finds Joe in an elegant shirt and trousers trying to tie his
     tie.

                    PARRISH
          Good morning.

                    JOE
          Good morning, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          How are you?  How're you feeling?

                    JOE
          'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you
          feel?

                    PARRISH
          Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well.
          This is crazy.  This is the left-
          field thing of all time.  What do I
          do?  What do I tell my family?

                    JOE
          Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything,
          Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we
          had last night.  I felt as if I were
          being treated like a person.  'Joe'
          this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile
          - Quince passed me the rolls -- no
          'rapture' or 'passion' or any of
          those mighty things you seem so
          intent on imparting, but I am cer-
          tain, should you - uh - say - uh -
          who I am - our adventure would end
          abruptly.

     Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing
     of silk stretching across his collarbone.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          But I did so enjoy your family.

     Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully.

                    PARRISH
          What about my family?  This 'adven-
          ture' involved only me, right?

     Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses
     to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Tell you what, you promised that it's
          going to be only me and --

                    JOE
          And what?

                    PARRISH
          And I won't tell anyone who you are.

                    JOE
          Sounds fair enough.

                    PARRISH
          It is a deal?

                    JOE
          A 'deal'?

                    PARRISH
          You give your word, I give mine --
          that we'll do what we say.  It's a
          truth exchanged between two people.

     A moment.

                    JOE
          Bill --

                    PARRISH
          Yes?

                    JOE
          You've got a deal.

     Parrish seems relieved.  He has now, with some difficulty,
     completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on
     Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror.
     Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the
     balls of his feet, quite taken.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          This is great!
               (a moment)
          Now what do we do?

                    PARRISH
          Shake hands.

     Joe immediately extends his hand toward Parrish, but
     Parrish freezes on seeing the hand, stares at it, now takes
     it.  Joe pumps Parrish's hand vigorously, then breaks into a
     broad smile.

     EXT. 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

     Parrish and Joe striding downtown, Joe's jacket fits per-
     fectly, he blends right in and he clearly enjoys being part
     of the smart Fifth Avenue crowd on the way to work.  Parrish
     senses Joe's pleasure, his slight preening, his eyes check-
     ing out the good-looking women headed for the offices at the
     top of corporate high-rises.

                    PARRISH
          You know, I got to thinking last
          night -- with you here, and seem-
          ingly occupied, how's your work
          going - uh - elsewhere?

     A flicker from Joe.  He has heard what Parrish has said, his
     eyes busy with the grift and the sparkle of the Avenue, but
     he is concentrating on Parrish's words.

                    JOE
          When you were shaving this morning,
          you weren't just shaving, right?

                    PARRISH
          What do you mean?

                    JOE
          You were hatching ideas, making
          plans, arriving at decisions, right?

                    PARRISH
          I guess so.

                    JOE
          So you understand the concept then.
          When you're busy here, your work,
          what your task is, is being executed
          elsewhere.

                    PARRISH
          Of course.

                    JOE
          So you've grasped the idea.  Con-
          gratulations.  Now multiply it by
          infinity and take it to the depth
          of forever, and you still will
          have barely a glimpse of what I
          am talking about.

     Parrish falls silent, chewing over Joe's admonition.

                    PARRISH
          Joe --?

                    JOE
          Yes, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          How about giving a guy a break?

                    JOE
          Make an exception?

                    PARRISH
          There's one to every rule.

                    JOE
          Not this.

     They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home
     in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, un-
     characteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his
     lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out:

                    PARRISH
          -- I don't deserve this.  I'm still
          young, this is not my time --

                    JOE
          That's what everybody says.

                    PARRISH
          I'm not everybody.

                    JOE
          That's what everybody says.

     Parrish is trying to control himself, glances at Joe.

                    PARRISH
          I want to live.

                    JOE
          I understand.

     A moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          But you can't.

     A sudden silence between them.  Parrish's shoulders appear
     to have stopped slightly, the courage he displayed at rais-
     ing these issues has vanished.

                    PARRISH
          What's it like?

                    JOE
          What do you mean?

                    PARRISH
          What's it like where I'm going?

                    JOE
          Can you keep a secret?

                    PARRISH
          Yes.

                    JOE
          So can I.

     They turn into Parrish's office building.

     INT. LOBBY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     As Parrish and Joe enter, Parrish is hailed by JAIME, the
     Elevator Starter.

                    JAIME
          Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          Good morning, Jaime.

                    JAIME
          Knight's Reward in the 4th at
          Calder --

     A bemused Parrish walks on, Joe beside him, Jaime pursuing
     them.

                    JAIME (cont'd)
          -- A closer in today with cheap
          speed.  The colt will come from the
          clouds and boom!  Fifty-eight dollar
          horse.  I get you down, Mr. Parrish,
          just say the word.

                    PARRISH
               (smiles)
          I'm sorry, not today, Jaime.

     Parrish and Joe arrive at the bank of elevators.  Jaime,
     back at his post, hits a button.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
               (to Joe)
          You know, everyday I've walked into
          this building, Jaime gives me a
          horse.
               (a moment)
          I wonder if any of them won.

     The elevator materializes, Parrish and Joe step on.

     INT. PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS, OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN - DAY

     Parrish and Joe emerge from the executive elevator, Jennifer
     is waiting as usual with her pad, "Good morning"s, etc.  As
     Parrish strides down the hall, Joe right beside him, he passes
     instructions back to Jennifer who, scribbling, hurries along
     behind them.

                    PARRISH
          -- And call my family, I'd like them
          to come over for dinner tonight.

                    JENIFER
          Didn't the family get together last
          night --?

                    PARRISH
               (remonstrating, gently)
          Jennifer.

                    JENIFER
          Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.

     Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as
     Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room.

                    PARRISH
               (to Joe)
          Perhaps you would like to wait in my
          office --?

                    JOE
          No.

                    PARRISH
          What I'm trying to say is this is a
          Board meeting and you are not a mem-
          ber of the Board.

                    JOE
          I'm sure you'll see to it that it
          won't be a problem.

     Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for
     the doorknob.

     INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.  A euphony
     of "Good morning"'s from the various members of the Board,
     including Quince.  Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe,
     right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pas-
     tries, he heads for them.

                    PARRISH
               (to the Board)
          -- This is Joe Black, a personal
          associate of mine - uh - he'll be
          joining us today.  I know it's --
          uh -- unusual, and my apologies --
          and Drew -- uh -- carry on.

     Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at
     Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded
     but intense.

                    DREW
               (after a moment, to
                Joe)
          Nice to see you.  I didn't expect
          you, but certainly you can't get
          enough of a good thing.

                    JOE
          Thank you.

                    DREW
               (to the Board)
          The Board of Parrish Communications -
          is hereby called to order.  Our sole
          order of business is an acceptance
          of John Bontecou's generous offer
          and --

                    JOE
               (to Drew)
          Do you have any more of these deli-
          cious cookies?

     A hushed silence at the inappropriateness of Joe's inter-
     ruption.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          And a cup of tea.  With milk, I
          think.  I'd like to try it English-
          style.  Yes, a cup of tea with milk.

                    DREW
          Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about
          some water?

                    JOE
          Why yes, thank you.

                    DREW
          Hot or cold.

                    JOE
          Cold.

                    DREW
          And a glass.

     Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's
     refreshments.

                    PARRISH
               (quietly, indicating a
                chair)
          Would you like to sit down, Joe?

                    JOE
          Yes.

     Joe sits.

                    DREW
          To review -- we're really crossing
          the 't's and dotting the 'i's here.
          Bill had a great and conclusive
          meeting with John Bontecou yester-
          day, all that remains for us is to
          put it to a vote.

     Smiles and murmurs of a congratulatory receptiveness from
     the Board at Drew's news.

                    PARRISH
               (emptily)
          Thank you, Drew.

     Parrish takes a moment, draws himself up to say something
     official then stops himself, what follows is spontaneous,
     reflective, deeply felt.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Umm -- I did enjoy -- or rather I
          was interested in meeting John yes-
          terday -- impressive... I suppose...
          But it did get me to thinking.  I
          started in this business because
          this is what I wanted to do.  I knew
          I wasn't going to write the Great
          American Novel, but I also knew
          there was more to life than buying
          something for a dollar and selling
          it for two.  I wanted to give the
          news to the world, and I wanted to
          give it unvarnished.  The more we
          all know about each other, the
          greater the chance we will survive.
          Sure, I want to make a profit, you
          can't exist without one but John
          Bontecou is all profit.  If we give
          him license to absorb Parrish
          Communications, and he has his eye
          on a few others after us, we'll be
          appointing him to the position he
          craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
          reach the world you will have to go
          through John Bontecou.  And not only
          will you have to pay him to do this,
          far more expensive, you'll have to
          agree with him.  Reporting the news
          is a privilege and a responsibility
          and it is not exploitable.  Parrish
          Communications has earned this priv-
          ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
          it.  As your chairman, I urge you to
          agree this company is not for sale.

     A silence, everybody shifts, the Board is in shock, Drew is
     trying to maintain his balance.

                    DREW
               (carefully)
          ...Sounds like you're not leaving
          much room for discussion.

                    PARRISH
               (to the Board)
          Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm
          reversing my field.

                    DREW
          That's your privilege, Bill.  But
          given our needs, given the absolute
          necessity for growth, given the fu-
          ture, the truth is... joining John
          Bontecou is every bit as certain as -
          Death and Taxes.

     Joe interjects:

                    JOE
          'Death and Taxes'?

     After a moment.

                    DREW
          Yes.

                    JOE
          "Death and Taxes"?

     Another moment.

                    DREW
          Yes.

                    JOE
          What an odd pairing.

                    DREW
          It's just a saying, Mr. Black,

                    JOE
          Of whom?

                    DREW
          It doesn't matter.

                    JOE
          Then why did you bring it up?

     Drew regards Joe.

                    DREW
          You're not familiar with the phrase,
          "In this world, nothing is certain
          but Death and Taxes"?

                    PARRISH
          I am now.

                    DREW
          Glad I could be of some help.

     The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by
     his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew
     coolly grasps the irritation of the members.  Parrish breaks
     the silence.

                    PARRISH
          Shall we adjourn?

                    DREW
          But the matter's still on the table,
          Bill --

     EDWARD SLOANE, a contemporary of Parrish's, has been warily
     silent, but extremely observant.  Protective of Parrish, and
     sensing his burgeoning difficulty, he interrupts:

               SLOANE
          Why don't we let it rest for the
          moment?  Give it some air?

                    PARRISH
          Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall
          we?

     Joe rises.

                    JOE
               (to Drew)
          Those cookies were excellent.

     He exits with Parrish, the door closes behind them.  A BABBLE
     of disturbed reactions from the Board.

                    DREW
          Who is that guy?

     Drew grabs a telephone:

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Felicia?


               FELICIA (O.S.)
          Yes, sir?

                    DREW
          Get me a Field Background check on
          Joe Black.  Litigations. Bankrupt-
          cies.  Credit ratings.  The works.
          Got it?

     Drew hangs up.

     INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Parrish enters, Joe right on his heels.  They booth stop,
     Parrish regards him.

                    PARRISH
          -- What's the deal here?  Are you
          going to be breathing down my neck
          right 'til the very end?

                    JOE
          I don't understand.

     Parrish tries to gather himself.

                    PARRISH
          ...I'd like to be alone for a while.

                    JOE
          Are you sad, Bill?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, I am.  There's a research lib-
          rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't
          you go down and read some magazines?

                    JOE
          You're not thinking of going some-
          where, are you, Bill?

                    PARRISH
          Joe, could I ask you to take a walk?
          Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll
          be seeing you.

                    JOE
          Of course.

     But Joe doesn't move.

                    PARRISH
               (prompting)
          Now I'd like to be alone.

                    JOE
          Oh.  Okay.

     Parrish reaches into his pocket and hands Joe some cash.

                    PARRISH
          Here -- this will hold you for a
          while.

     Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          You know about money, don't you?

                    JOE
          It can't buy happiness?

     Parrish opens the door.

                    PARRISH
          Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of
          the city.

                    JOE
          No thank you, Bill.  I can manage.

     Joe goes.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

     Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on
     an examining table beside them.  As she finishes, she
     suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception
     area.  She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last
     notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the
     corridor.

                    SUSAN
          Joe --

                    JOE
          How nice you look.  Is that your
          uniform?

     Susan regards him.

                    SUSAN
          Why did you come here?

     Joe doesn't have an answer.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Are you ill?

                    JOE
          Oh goodness, no.

                    SUSAN
          Then why are you here, Joe?

                    JOE
          I came to see you.

                    SUSAN
          I don't have any time to see you
          now.  I'm doing grand rounds and
          then I'm examining back-to-back
          patients until dinner and then --

                    JOE
          Very well, I'll watch.

                    SUSAN
          Watch me do what?

                    JOE
          Whatever you do.

                    SUSAN
          That's impossible.  I'm a doctor,
          I'm --

                    JOE
          And I'll be a visitor.

                    SUSAN
          Patients have visitors, not doctors.

                    JOE
          I don't mind --

     Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-
     thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is
     holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat,
     in great pain.

                    TEENA
               (urgently)
          Miss?  Miss Doctor?

                    SUSAN
               (gently)
          Just a minute, please.

                    TEENA
          Please.  My momma's sicker'n he
          is.

     Easter looks up and sees Joe.  She abruptly becomes still,
     eyes wide, as if sudden recognition.

                    EASTER
          Obeah.

                    TEENA
          No, Momma.

     But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful.

                    EASTER
          Obeah mon.  I gonna die.

                    TEENA
          Momma, stop it. Is just a man.

     Joe looks at Easter, curiously.

                    SUSAN
               (to Teena)
          What's obeah?

                    TEENA
          Bad spirit.  She just all fever, she
          don' mean nothin'.  Please help us?

                    SUSAN
          Have you filled out the insurance
          forms?

     Teena shakes her hand anxiously.  Joe leans forward to
     Easter and speaks softly in perfect, lilting West Indian
     dialect.

                    JOE
          No obeah, sister.  No duppy, no
          jumbie.  Evera ting gon' be irey.

     Susan and Teena both look at him, astonished.  Easter's
     fearful gaze remains locked on him.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Go wi' de doctor lady.  Momma be
          fine.

                    EASTER
          Don' leave!?

                    TEENA
               (pleading)
          Momma.

     Susan leads Teena away.  Easter is riveted on Joe.

                    EASTER
               (with certainty)
          Obeah.

                    JOE
          Obeah evil.  I not evil.

                    EASTER
          What you then?

                    JOE
          I from dat nex' place.

                    EASTER
          You wait here'n to take us?  Like
          you bus driver to dere?

                    JOE
               (smiles)
          No, no.  I on holiday.

                    EASTER
               (looks around, dubious)
          Some spot you pick.

     She winces with pain, gasping.

                    EASTER (cont'd)
          Pain is bad.

                    JOE
          I nuttin' to do wi' dat.

                    EASTER
          Make it go 'way.

                    JOE
          Doctor lady make it irey.

                    EASTER
          Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru.
          Make it go 'way.

                    JOE
          Can't, sistah.

                    EASTER
               (adamant, pleading)
          Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex'
          place.

     Joe regards Easter, a long moment.

                    JOE
          Not time yet.

                    EASTER
          Make it time.

     Joe shakes his head, a firm no.  But when he looks and speaks
     to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret.

                    JOE
          Can't feel wi' de way tings gotta
          be, Easter.

     Susan and Teena return with an Orderly and a wheelchair for
     Easter.

                    EASTER
               (to Joe)
          Please...

                    TEENA
          Come now, Momma.

     Easter is helped into the wheelchair.  She looks pleadingly
     at Joe.  The Orderly starts to wheel her away.  Joe stays him,
     putting his hand on Easter's arm.

                    JOE
          Close your eyes, Easter.

     She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Soon.

     He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off.

                    SUSAN
               (to Teena)
          Go with her.  I'll be right there.

     Teena goes.  Joe remains his normal voice.

                    JOE
          She's in a great deal of pain.

                    SUSAN
          Yes.

     Susan regards Joe, puzzled.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Have you spent a lot of time in the
          islands?

                    JOE
          Some.

     Joe shifts.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my
          being here - um - your patient --
          this is not really appropriate --
          and I - uh --

                    SUSAN
          Don't apologize.  There's nothing
          to be sorry for -- every hospital
          should have someone like you.

     Silence.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Well...I'm glad you came.

                    JOE
          Thank you.  I'm so very glad to be
          here.

     Another awkward silence.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          I guess you're busy --

                    SUSAN
          Yes.

     She doesn't move, they search for words.

                    JOE
          Well, I could come again some other
          time.

     Susan regards him.

                    SUSAN
          Joe, I'm with Drew.

                    JOE
               (sincerely)
          Not now.

     Susan smiles gently.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Don't you want me to come again...?

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          I have to go, I'm sorry to say --

                    JOE
          Be sorry for nothing.

     Another moment.

                    SUSAN
          Yes.  Well...thank you, Joe.

     Susan turns to go, hesitates.

                    JOE
          Good-bye, Susan.

     Susan waves softly to him, heads down the hall, glances back
     once to see Joe has not moved, is watching her depart.

     INT. PARRISH'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

     Jennifer shows Joe in, Parrish is deep in thought, beside
     him a meal laid out beautifully on his desk with linen and
     silver, but untouched.

     Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is starting at
     Parrish's food.

                    JOE
          Are you going to eat your lunch

                    PARRISH
          It's all yours.

     Joe starts eating, Parrish watches him, somewhat fascinated,
     Joe's chewing has improved.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Good?

                    JOE
          Excellent.  What is it?

                    PARRISH
          Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A
          little Coleman's mustard.

     Joe takes another big bite.

                    JOE
          Truly - uh - splendid.

                    PARRISH
          Glad you like it.  My wife turned me
          onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan --
          that was my wife --

                    JOE
               (familiarly)
          Uh-huh.

                    PARRISH
          Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy
          as roast beef, not as boring as
          chicken.  She knew stuff like that.

     Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          -- Everything reminds me of her --
          there isn't a day that goes by that
          I don't think about her -- One day
          she was here.  The next day she was
          gone.  What are you going to do? --
          I guess you've heard all this a
          trillion times before.

                    JOE
          And more.

                    PARRISH
          Why didn't you stop me?

                    JOE
          Well...I don't know.

     Silence.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          How was it the first time you met
          her?

                    PARRISH
          I thought you'd heard a trillion
          times --

                    JOE
          This part I'm interested in.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          She had on this little blue suit --
          with a little white collar that had
          little red piping on it --

     Joe is riveted on Parrish ow, Parrish aware of him, has
     paused.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          You could have put her under glass
          and I would have just stood and
          looked at her.  But when she spoke
          -- I loved the sound of her voice
          and her laugh --
               (a moment)
          -- I couldn't get enough of her --
          and gradually -- or maybe it wasn't
          gradually -- I realized I couldn't
          live without her.

     A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish,
     then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway.

                    DREW
          May I interrupting?

                    JOE
          Yes.

                    PARRISH
          No.

                    DREW
               (to joe)
          'Just kidding'?

                    PARRISH
          Sit down, Drew.

                    DREW
          Before I do --
               (glances at Joe)
          I was hoping we might be alone,
          Bill.

                    PARRISH
          Joe and I have no secrets from each
          other.

                    DREW
               (to Joe)
          How nice for you both.

     Drew takes a moment, then plunges in.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Bill, pardon my candor, but I was
          confounded by your decision this
          morning.

                    PARRISH
          Why?

                    DREW
          I was hired, you told me, to help
          bring Parrish Communications into
          the 21st Century.  This merger is
          the vehicle --

     Joe interrupts:

                    JOE
          Perhaps a merger is a way to bring
          Bill's company into the 21st cen-
          tury.  And perhaps it isn't.  And
          perhaps cheating on your French
          Philosophers exam at The Groton
          School was an expedient way to get
          your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.
          Be that as it may, Drew, a question
          can often be argued both ways.

     Drew is stunned.

                    PARRISH
          Joe, cut it out.  And you too, Drew.

                    DREW
               (to Parrish)
          I thought this was practically a
          done deal --

                    PARRISH
          Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget
          Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of
          his fancy name and his fancy offer.
          I'm not going for it.

     A moment.

                    DREW
          Okay.

     Drew heads for the door, turns around.

                    DREW (cont'd)
               (to Parrish)
          Can I invite myself to dinner
          tonight?
               (a moment)
          Susan and I had ticket for the
          Knicks game.  But she said you
          guys were getting together --

                    PARRISH
          Dinner?  Absolutely.

                    JOE
          Absolutely.

                    DREW
               (to Joe)
          Damn decent of you.

     Drew exits.

                    JOE
          Why, at this juncture, are you
          letting yourself be so concerned
          by business matters?

                    PARRISH
          I don't want anybody buying up my
          life's work and turning it into
          something it wasn't meant to be.  A
          man wants to leave something behind.
          And he wants it left behind the way
          he made it.  And he wants it to be
          run the way he run it -- with a sense
          of honor, of dedication, of truth.
          Okay?

                    JOE
          Okay.

                    PARRISH
          And I don't need your goddamn permis-
          sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't
          need anyone to tell me how to run my
          life.

                    JOE
          Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a
          heart attack and ruin my vacation.

     INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE, NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

     The skyline glitters through the terrace windows.  The hour
     is before dinner, Coyle and Luisa weave seamlessly among the
     family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray.

     Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a
     distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace.  Joe's eyes
     are on Susan across the room.  Her eyes flicker towards him,
     aware of his gaze.

                    ALLISON
               (to Susan)
          ...We're never all together two
          nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas,
          Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's
          going on?

                    SUSAN
          Nothing's going on.  Maybe he
          doesn't want to be alone.  He's go-
          ing to be sixty-five in a minute --

                    ALLISON
          ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny
          to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's
          like he dropped from the clouds...

     Drew enters.  He nuzzles Susan's neck, out of the corner of
     her eye she sees Joe still observing them.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          ...When Daddy walked in with him, he
          couldn't even remember his name.  Now
          he's his house guest.  And you know
          how he hates house guests.  What is
          going on?

     Drew, whose eyes have also been on Joe across the room, turns
     back.

                    DREW
               (to Susan and Allison)
          Good question.

     Allison sees Susan's eyes flicker over towards Joe.

                    ALLISON
          -- But he does seem very nice.

                    SUSAN
          You think so?

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Over at the terrace, Quince buttonholes Parrish, Joe stand-
     ing by.

                    QUINCE
               (to Parrish)
          ...I read you all the way on the
          Bontecou thing, and I know where
          you're coming from.  And I'm with
          you a hundred and one percent.

                    PARRISH
          Thank you, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          But I've got to tell you, if mergers
          are in the wild, I've got some great
          prospects I've developed.  I want to
          talk to you about them next week.

                    PARRISH
          Next week?

                    QUINCE
          Yeah.  Or the week after.

     Quince sees Parrish hesitate.

                    QUINCE (cont'd)
          No good?

                    PARRISH
          No, anything is possible.
               (lightly)
          It's up to Joe.

                    QUINCE
          Joe, you don't know how glad I am
          you're aboard.  Anybody who can take
          some of the weight off the old man,
          I'm in his corner.

                    JOE
          That's very gracious of you, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          No problem.  I'll leave you two
          alone.  I can tell you guys have
          something on the fire --

     An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as
     Allison appears.

                    ALLISON
               (to Parrish)
          Did you know twenty-six members of
          your rifle company are coming?

                    PARRISH
          Who?

                    ALLISON
          From the Korean War.

                    PARRISH
          Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.

                    ALLISON
          Whatever it was, they'll be here.
          We sent out invitations to everyone,
          plane tickets included -- the RSVP's
          are amazing.  A few of them we didn't
          hear from, and some of them are dead,
          of course --

                    PARRISH
          Of course.

                    ALLISON
               (a moment)
          You know, we're going to give this
          party for you whether you like it or
          not.

                    PARRISH
          I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I
          don't seem more appreciative.

                    ALLISON
               (resignedly)
          That's okay, Daddy.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Across the room, Quince has pulled Drew aside:

                    QUINCE
          ...I know you're down, but you know
          when you're down, Drew, there's no
          place to go but up.

                    DREW
          Thanks, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some
          other merger possibilities up my
          sleeve, and I'm putting them to see
          old man.

                    DREW
          Are you?

                    QUINCE
          We'll do it together.  I'll clue you
          in.  Timing's got to be right.  The
          old man says it's up to Joe.

                    DREW
          'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his
          words?

                    QUINCE
          Yeah.

                    DREW
          'It's up to Joe', huh?

                    QUINCE
          Yeah, that's what he said.

                    DREW
          Well, that's very interesting.

     Drew gazes intently over at Joe who is crossing to Susan,
     for the moment by herself near the piano.

                    QUINCE
          I thought so, too.  Joe's a neat
          guy.

                    DREW
          Yeah.  Neat.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Joe approaches Susan.

                    JOE
          I wanted to apologize, Susan --

                    SUSAN
          I thought you said 'Be sorry for
          nothing'.

                    JOE
          Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding
          on you this afternoon.

                    SUSAN
          It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it
          was, it turned out to be welcome.

                    JOE
          I appreciate you --

                    SUSAN
          Excuse me?

                    JOE
          I mean I appreciate that.

                    SUSAN
          And I appreciate you, too.

     A moment between them.

                    JOE
               (delighted)
          You do?  Well, thank you very much.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Drew crosses over to Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          I was a little abrupt with you this
          afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want
          you to know I value your advice.

                    DREW
          As much as Joe's?

     Parrish doesn't answer.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Who is this man?  He's giving
          ubiquitous a bad name.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          You're competitive soul, Drew.
          That's what makes you a great addi-
          tion to the money.  Joe is just...
          around.

                    DREW
          For how long?  And why?

                    PARRISH
          Please.  Don't worry about him.  And
          above all, don't antagonize him.

     Drew glances over at Joe.

                    DREW
          Boss's orders, huh?  I'm great at
          following them.  And I think I'll
          start right now.

     Allison calls out from the other side of the room:

                    ALLISON
          Dinner's ready, everybody!

     A BUZZ as Coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the
     family files in, Drew lingering behind with Joe.

                    DREW
          I have a confession to make to you,
          Joe.

     Joe just smiles in response.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Do you want to hear it?

                    JOE
               (pleasantly)
          No.

                    DREW
          Well, I'm going to tell you anyway.
          I did cheat on that exam at Groton.
          But so did twenty-six other guys,
          and nobody ever mentioned it until
          today.  And I'm expecting you won't
          mention it again.  I don't know who
          you are and where you're getting
          your information, but I'm willing to
          pretend I did not hear it, and let
          bygones be bygones.  But can I tell
          you something else, it'd be nice to
          see the big guy without you next to
          him.  What are you, his shadow?  Do
          you hold his dick for him when he
          goes to take a leak?  You know some-
          times somebody would like a few min-
          utes alone with W.P.  That means
          without you.  Okay, pal?  Let's eat.

     INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances
     averted, Allison notices Susan and Joe looking at each
     other, Drew observes Parrish watching Joe, Quince, on the
     other hand, just eats.

     Breaking the silence, Parrish chinks his glass, stands.

                    PARRISH
          -- I - uh - want to thank you all
          for coming - uh - my family --

     Everyone at the table is all attention.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          -- Allison and Quince, Susan -- and
          the other members --

     He glances at Joe, stops.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          -- I'm so happy when we can get
          together -- I mean I know you all
          have busy lives --

                    SUSAN
          Look who's talking.

                    ALLISON
               (a laugh)
          Yeah, speak for yourself.

                    PARRISH
          Anyway -- I remember when you were
          little girls --

     An awkward pause.  Quince chooses to fill the silence.

                    QUINCE
          I love little girls --

     Allison elbows him.

                    PARRISH
          And now you're all grown up -- and
          I'm - uh - um --

     Parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, Drew
     clocking his behavior very carefully.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I had some words all prepared but
          now I've forgotten them - uh - um -
          wait a minute.

     Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Uh, it's gone...um -- it was on the
          tip of my tongue.

                    SUSAN
          It'll come back, Daddy.

                    PARRISH
          Will it?...

     Parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Anyway, I'd like to go on but...

     He hesitates, drifts into silence.

                    ALLISON
               (tentatively)
          Daddy, you could sit down if you
          wanted to.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          There is so much I would like to say
          -- but I can't --
               (another moment)
          So I better sit down.  Carry on,
          everybody.

     He sits, then immediately stands up again.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          One other thing -- why don't we all
          have dinner again tomorrow night?

                    ALLISON
          Dinner?  Again?

                    SUSAN
          Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?

                    PARRISH
               (with great sincerity)
          No.

     The word lands with effect, Susan and Allison have heard it
     well.

                    SUSAN
          We'll be here.

                    QUINCE
          You bet.

                    ALLISON
          With bells on.

     The guests try to return to their food, Susan is the most
     concerned about Parrish's lapse, she does not say anything
     but Drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of
     a display, gives her a pro forma hug.  Joe has observed
     every instant of Drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable
     when Coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a
     roast that has been carved.

                    JOE
               (to Coyle)
          I would prefer some peanut butter.

                    COYLE
          How would you like that, sir?  On
          some kind of toast?

                    JOE
          Toast?  No...just the butter.

                    COYLE
          Right away.

     Coyle heads for the kitchen.

                    SUSAN
          Why do you love peanut butter so
          much?

                    JOE
               (intimately)
          I don't know.

                    SUSAN
          I adore things like that....food I
          can't do without.  Don't you?

     Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the
     room.

                    JOE
          Yes...

                    SUSAN
          It comforts you, doesn't it?

                    JOE
               (captivated)
          Yes...I've found that it does.

                    DREW
          Mind if I throw up?

                    PARRISH
               (admonishing gently)
          Please, Drew.

                    JOE
               (to Susan)
          I'm very concerned about the woman
          you attended to today.

                    SUSAN
          I am, too.

                    JOE
          Has her pain abated?

                    SUSAN
          We're doing what we can for her.
          But it doesn't look good.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry to hear that.

                    DREW
          Who are we talking about?

                    JOE
               (to Susan)
          But I know she's grateful for the
          care you're giving her.

                    DREW
          Is this a state secret or are we
          being excluded just for the fun of
          it?

                    JOE
               (to Drew)
          Susan's patient is whom we are
          talking about.

                    SUSAN
          Joe visited the hospital today.

     Parrish's head swivels to Joe.

                    ALLISON
          Did he?  That's more than we get to
          do.

                    DREW
          Well, maybe next time Joe goes,
          he'll take us along.

                    JOE
          Perhaps you could remind me.

                    DREW
          I'll make a note of it.  Anything
          else?

                    QUINCE
          I'd like to come, too.  See Susan
          strut her stuff.

                    DREW
          You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination
          Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour
          Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to
          you?

     Silence.  Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects
     a sudden concern with their relationship.

                    JOE
          Susan is a wonderful doctor.

     INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     After dinner, the family and guests file back in from the
     dining room, Drew alongside Parrish.

                    DREW
          I have to go, Bill -- it's been a
          helluva day.  Need a few minutes to
          sort everything out.

                    PARRISH
          Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

                    DREW
          Sure.

     Drew peels off, heads for the foyer and front door, Susan
     follows him.

     Parrish corners Joe.

                    PARRISH
          Why did you go to the hospital?

                    JOE
          I don't know.

                    PARRISH
          You were just curious?

                    JOE
          I guess...

                    PARRISH
          About Susan?

                    JOE
          I wouldn't put it that way.

                    PARRISH
          What way would you put it?

                    JOE
          You tell me, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          How about you telling me?  When I
          ask a simple question, I expect a
          straight answer.  That's what I'm
          used to.  Anybody who doesn't give
          it to me, I fire.

                    JOE
          Are you going to fire me, Bill?

     Silence, Parrish is at a loss.

     INT. FOYER - NIGHT

     Drew is putting on his coat, Susan with him, a tension between
     them, a heavy silence finally broken.

                    SUSAN
          ...See you tomorrow night.

                    DREW
          Include me out.  I've had enough of
          the conversations.

                    SUSAN
          You don't mean that.  You wouldn't
          disappoint Daddy --

                    DREW
          Daddy'll do fine.  Besides, he's got
          Joe.
               (a moment)
          And so do you.

                    SUSAN
          Drew, you're out of line.

                    DREW
          That may be.  But I don't like the
          fucker.  I don't like the way he
          looks at you and talks to you.  And
          vice versa.

                    SUSAN
          Sorry, but I like the way he looks
          and talks to me.  And vice versa.
          Okay?

                    DREW
          No, not okay.  I thought we had a
          good thing going here.
               (a moment)
          It shows you never know.

     Silence, neither knows how to continue.

                    SUSAN
          Well... goodnight.

                    DREW
          Yeah.  Goodnight.

     Drew goes, Susan turns to find out at the far end of the foyer,
     he's been observing them.  She walks up to him.

                    SUSAN
          How long have you been standing
          there?

                    JOE
          I don't like the way Drew spoken to
          you.  But I feel better about it now
          because of the way you spoke back.

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          Tell me about yourself, Joe.  Who
          you are.  What you're doing with my
          father.

     Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          So you're not going to tell me?

     Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's
     inquiries.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          You're married, aren't you?

                    JOE
          Why?

                    SUSAN
          Because guys who never say anything
          about themselves are always married.

     Joe doesn't respond.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          So you are married.

                    JOE
          No, I'm not.

                    SUSAN
          Girlfriend?

                    JOE
          No.

                    SUSAN
          Gay?

                    JOE
          No.

     Susan comes closer to Joe.

                    SUSAN
          Then tell me, Joe, how come a man
          as attractive, intelligent, well-
          spoken ,diffident in the most sed-
          uctive way, and yet powerful, is all
          alone in this world?

     Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted
     by Susan.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          I'm sorry, I don't want to pry and
          you don't want to tell me.  So let's
          leave it a mystery.  That's the way
          you want it, isn't it?

     Susan takes another step closer to Joe.

                    JOE
          Thank you, I appreciate that.

     They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds
     them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the
     stairs.

                    SUSAN
          Where are you going?

                    JOE
               (softly)
          To bed.

                    SUSAN
               (suddenly fragile)
          'To bed'?

                    JOE
          Yes.  I'm tired.

     He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the
     stairs, Susan watches him disappear.

     She turns back into the salon just as Allison and Quince are
     exiting, "good-byes" all around.  Susan is left alone now
     with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar.

                    PARRISH
          That was wonderful.

                    SUSAN
          Yeah, it's good to get together.

                    PARRISH
          Do you mind if I raise a little
          caution flag?

                    SUSAN
          Raise away.

                    PARRISH
          What is the nature of your interest
          in Joe?

                    SUSAN
          Well, remember how you told me about
          "lightning striking"?  The nature of
          it's in there somewhere.

     Parrish drops another cube of ice in his drink, takes his
     time before answering.

                    PARRISH
          I won't say you may be getting onto
          shaken ground --

                    SUSAN
          Then what will you say?

                    PARRISH
          I don't think this is the lightning
          you are looking for.  Drew's a good
          man.  I know I didn't seem to be
          completely in his corner before, but
          I've come to appreciate --

                    SUSAN
          Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo-
          ten?  What's going on?

                    PARRISH
          Nothing.

                    SUSAN
          When you say 'nothing' that way,
          it's not nothing.

                    PARRISH
          Then what is it?

                    SUSAN
          It's something.

     She kisses him.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          G'night, Daddy.  See you tomorrow.
          This is getting interesting.

     She goes.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. THE CARLYLE HOTEL - NEXT DAY

     A large suite, room service carts creaking with pots of
     coffee and half-eaten pastries.  The Board of Parrish
     Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince.
     Felicia, Drew's secretary, takes notes.

                    DREW
          ...I know you're all as uncomfor-
          table as I am to be meeting without
          Bill, but I got a call last night
          from John Bontecou.  Not only is he
          still interested, he is sweetening
          his offer.
               (a moment)
          Although it pains me to say it, in
          my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
          us peremptorily in dismissing any
          deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm
          sorry to say that if we are to exam-
          ine this new offer responsibly as
          the Board of Directors of Parrish
          Communications, we must do so with-
          out its Chairman.
               (another moment)
          Oh yes, there is one additional
          element: Bontecou is so anxious to
          get us, he said he'd take Parrish
          Communications with our Chairman or
          without.

     The Board falls silent.  Sloane, a peer of Parrish's,
     fidgets.  Drew milks the moment.

                    DREW (cont'D)
          It's no surprise if I suggest to you
          that the Bill Parrish we know is not
          the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
          You heard that speech -- some strange
          emotional rationale to buttress a
          knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
          offer.  Does it not strike you that
          something is possibly affecting this
          man's judgement?  More specifically
          -- his judgement to make a critical
          business decision?

     Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.

                    DREW (cont'D)
          It's not pleasant to say the follow-
          ing, but I would be remiss, in this
          crisis, if I did not.  When we pre-
          sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
          offer, and if he refuses to let us
          consider it -- once more makes an
          adamant or emotional rejection -- we
          will have no choice but to seek an
          alternative.

                    SLOANE
          And what would that be?

                    DREW
          Bill's birthday is the day after
          tomorrow.  There is a provisory by-
          law in our charter.  Per the discre-
          tion of the Board, Corporate off-
          icers can be retired at age sixty-
          five.

                    SLOANE
          You're taking this too far, Drew.

                    DREW
          Am I not obligated to?

     Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves
     the room.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          How did this all come about?  Crisis
          -- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
          pany, crisis for us.  I came about
          with the arrival on the scene of --
          Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe
          Black.  He attends our Board meet-
          int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
          sides in his office.  Never leaves
          his side.  And, in my opinion, is
          always in his ear.  Telling him what
          to do and Bill is listening.  Who is
          Joe Black?  What is his relationship
          to Bill Parrish?  And most important,
          what is behind his influence on our
          Chairman?

                    SLOANE
          You're building this thing up too
          much, Drew.  He's had advisors be-
          fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do.

     The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, sur-
     prised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles.

                    DREW
          Thank you for coming.

                    SLOANE
          Hello, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          Hi, Ed, hi folks, I didn't know
          everybody was going to be here, what
          a nice surprise.  What's the big
          confab?

                    SLOANE
               (acidly)
          This is a secret meeting.

                    DREW
               (to Quince)
          I hope you'll respect its nature --
          What we're trying to do here is
          gather our thoughts -- in light of
          Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
          -- and make an appropriate presenta-
          tion to him as to how we think the
          company might proceed.  Won't you
          share with our Board the information
          you gave me last night?

     Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind.
     He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
     Board.

                    QUINCE
          Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got
          good news.  As I was telling Drew,
          I've been making a little hay while
          the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
          possibly three new and boiling hot
          prospects for merger.

                    DREW
          How did Bill react to the leads
          you've developed?

                    QUINCE
          He was interested.

                    DREW
               (prompting)
          -- But he was concerned about the
          timing?

                    QUINCE
          The timing -- yes.  He says it's up
          to Joe.

                    DREW
          'It's up to Joe'?

                    QUINCE
          That's what he said.

     Quince, having dispensed his information, looks proudly
     around at the Board members.  They are stunned, Sloane in
     shock.  Drew is absolutely still, letting Quince's words
     sink in.

     INT. DINING ROOM, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Parrish, Joe, Susan, Allison and Quince are seated at the
     table, dessert plates in front of them, coffee cups beside.
     Allison and Susan's eyes are on Parrish, looking for some
     clue as to why has he gathered the family together yet
     again.  Parrish is somewhat within himself, but he peeks
     over his demi-tasse cup at Joe, Parrish aware of Joe's
     heightened interest in Susan, and Susan's reciprocation.

     Coyle enters carrying two imposing stemmed silver trays with
     cakes on them, Luisa follows with one other.  They set them
     down in front of Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          What is this?

                    ALLISON
          Annie made them.

                    PARRISH
          Who's Annie?

                    ALLISON
          From La Rosette, only the greatest
          pastry chef in America.
               (pointing)
          This is orange, from real Seville
          oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille
          crust, a little on the fanciful.
          And a while, nothing like a good old
          white cake, vanilla, with Angel food
          but some maroons shavings thrown in.

                    PARRISH
          I don't like cake.

                    ALLISON
          It's for the party, Dad --

                    PARRISH
          Oh, the goddam party --

                    ALLISON
          'Goddam party'!

     Allison bursts into tears.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
               (to Quince)
          Did you hear that?

     Quince quickly slashes a piece, takes a huge bite.

                    QUINCE
          This is great, honey.  The orange.
          Has it got a little vodka in it?
          Like that Finnish stuff, orange
          vodka --
               (to Parrish)
          Put your lips around this one, Bill.
          It's out of this world.

                    PARRISH
          No thank you, Quince.
               (to Allison)
          I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at
          this.  Why don't you choose whatever
          cake you like?

                    ALLISON
          I knew you were going to say that.
          Tito Puente.  The old platoon.  Now
          the cake.  You just don't care.  Why
          did I do this?  I should have my head
          examined.  I'm trying to throw the
          party for the century for my father -
          and you know what -- he doesn't give
          a shit.

     She bursts into tears all over again.

                    QUINCE
          But he does give a shit.  Don't you,
          Bill?

                    PARRISH
          Yeah, I give a shit.

                    QUINCE
          See.  There.  What'd I tell you?

     Joe watches as Quince dabs at Allison's tears with a napkin.

                    QUINCE (cont'd)
          Feel better?

                    ALLISON
          Yeah, but --

                    QUINCE
          But what?

                    ALLISON
          What will I tell Annie?

     Parrish forks a bit of a cake.

                    PARRISH
          This one.

                    QUINCE
          The vodka.  What'd I tell you?

     Quince puts a reassuring arm around Allison, she seems to
     relax now, Joe has been a keen observer of what has trans-
     pired between husband and wife, between man and woman, a
     sense that he has taken in the virtue of such a relation-
     ship.

     INT. SALON, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     After dinner, Parrish, Allison and Susan are gathered to-
     gether.  At the bar on the other side of the room, Joe
     watches as Quince pours himself a stiff hooker of brandy.

                    JOE
               (to Quince)
          Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth
          leading killer of adult Western
          males.

                    QUINCE
          I didn't know that.

                    JOE
          On the other hand, Winston Churchill
          drank a bottle of cognac a day and
          lived until he was ninety-one.

     After a moment.

                    QUINCE
          You're an original, Joe.  A little
          hard to figure, maybe...

                    JOE
          And you're a nice man, Quince.

                    QUINCE
          Thanks.

                    JOE
          You're welcome.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Drew appears unannounced in the doorway, exchanges a tense
     glance with Susan, then heads straight for Parrish who seems
     surprised to see him.

                    DREW
               (to Parrish)
          Sorry to intrude, Bill, but we've
          got a bit of a crisis downtown --
          it's not something we could talk
          about on the phone.

     Parrish takes Drew aside.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          The Board's real unhappy, Pappy --
          they felt you dealt with them pre-
          emptorily, you never gave them a
          chance to speak --

                    PARRISH
          What is there to say?  They know
          what John Bontecou is -- and if they
          didn't, they know now.

                    DREW
          Yes, you made your feeling abun-
          dantly clear.  Now they want to do
          the same with theirs.

                    PARRISH
          What are their feelings?

                    DREW
          If I read this Board right now, they
          want you to accept Bontecou's offer.

                    PARRISH
          Over my dead body.

     Parrish's burgeoning anger has now gotten the attention of
     Joe, Susan, Quince and Allison.

                    DREW
          What do you think the Board is going
          to say when I tell them that?

                    PARRISH
          I don't care.

                    DREW
          With all due respect, you damn well
          better care because if you try to
          stonewall them again, there'll be
          blood on the floor.

     Silence, Parrish carefully calibrating Drew's remark.

                    PARRISH
          Whose?

                    DREW
          Yours.

                    PARRISH
          I'm feeling real uncomfortable right
          now because the guy who reports to
          me is threatening me.

                    DREW
          I'm just giving you the truth.  There
          was a time when William Parrish liked
          the truth.

     Joe, although across the room, is all attention.

                    PARRISH
          I think it's time you went home,
          Drew.

                    DREW
          Certainly.  Goodnight.

     Drew goes, everybody is in shock, Susan pursues him out into
     the hallway.

                    SUSAN
          Drew!

     He stops.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Never talk to my father like that
          again.

                    DREW
          Don't worry about it.  There's a
          beginning and a middle and an end
          to everything.  And I think I've
          come to the end of my chapter with
          the Parrishes.

     Joe has followed them into the hallway.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          And the end began with this guy.

     Drew looks down towards Joe.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Mr. Black --?  We ran a check on you
          and you know what we came up with?

                    JOE
          No, I don't --

                    DREW
          Not good, not bad, you know what we
          got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars,
          no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.

     Joe waits.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          All of a sudden a guy appears on the
          scene with the Chairman of one of
          the greatest communications corpora-
          tions of the world, the boss makes
          him privy to all the company's
          secrets, he attends the Board meet-
          ings, and us working stiffs with
          MBA's up the ass and years and years
          and years of experience, we're left
          outside with our noses pressed
          against the window.

     Joe doesn't respond.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          This is a big-time operation, deal-
          ing in big-time issues, demanding
          big-time executives who make big-
          time decisions.  So, Joe, why don't
          you tell me exactly what it is
          that's big time about you?

     After a moment.

                    JOE
          You first.

                    SUSAN
               (to Drew)
          Why don't you get off his case?

                    DREW
          Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney
          now?  Are we going to go to court?
          Or are we going to go to bed?  And I
          don't mean you and me.  I mean you
          and him.

                    SUSAN
          That's it.  It's over.  Get out.

                    DREW
          So I guess a blowjob's out of the
          question?

     Joe clears his throat.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Did you say something?

     Joe considers him evenly.

                    JOE
          Almost.

                    SUSAN
               (to Drew)
          I said get out.

     Now Drew wheels, heads right for the front door and exits with
     a SLAM.

                    JOE
          What an angry fellow.

     A moment passes before Susan realizes she and Joe are alone,
     and Joe does as well.

                    SUSAN
          I'm sorry about --

                    JOE
          Please.  We don't need to talk about
          Drew.

     She regards Joe.

                    SUSAN
          No.  We don't.

     They drift, osmotically, into the library in awkward silence.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Brave you had a chance to look at
          Dad's rare books?  Jefferson's
          Parliamentary Manual, a first
          edition Bleak House --

     Joe comes closer, takes a deep breath.

                    JOE
          I love your smell.

                    SUSAN
          -- I guess you haven't.

     Now Susan, close to Joe, leans closer, her nose in Joe's
     neck.  Joe holds himself very still.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          I like your smell, too.

                    JOE
          Thank you.

                    SUSAN
          It was everything.

     Silence, the TICKING of the clock.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          When I was little, my mother used to
          say, "Darling, you could set your
          heart by this clock".

                    JOE
          -- Could you?

                    SUSAN
          Never tried, 'til now.
               (suddenly)
          Joe, may I kiss you?

                    JOE
          Why, yes.  Thank you.

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          You're welcome.

     Susan reaches out for Joe, they kiss, he is awkward but his
     very awkwardness endearing.  Susan pulls him closer, they
     linger now, mouths on each other's, then separate.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Thank you.

                    JOE
          You're welcome.

     The clock TICKS on.  A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's
     face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a
     point of no return.

                    SUSAN
          Joe?

     The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away.

                    JOE
          Yes?

                    SUSAN
          I don't know who you are.

                    JOE
          Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're
          Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak
          feeling in my knees --

                    SUSAN
          And is your heart beating strangely?

                    JOE
          Faster.  And I want the scent from
          underneath your ears and the taste
          of your lips and the touch of your
          tongue to stay with me -- forever.

     An intake of breath.  She is about to speak.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          And you don't even have to say a
          word.

     Their faces inches from each other's.

                    SUSAN
          I have to go home.

     But neither Susan nor Joe moves.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Don't I?

     Her question makes Joe, almost involuntarily, smile.  Susan
     takes the opportunity to step back from him.  The SOUND of
     someone at the door, it is Parrish, Susan turns, comprehends
     immediately how the situation will appear to him.

                    SUSAN
          Goodnight, Daddy.

     She drifts right past him, exits.  Joe and Parrish are left
     alone now, eyes on each other's.

                    JOE
          Hello, Bill.

                    PARRISH
               (carefully)
          Hello.  Would you like to join me,
          Quince and Allison for a nightcap?

                    JOE
          Um -- not right now.

     An awkward moment.

                    PARRISH
          Okay.  Goodnight.

                    JOE
          Goodnight.

     Parrish turns and exits, Joe's head inclines, he breathes in
     the scent of his collar.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. EXECUTIVE SUITE, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - NEXT DAY

     Parrish, followed by Joe, emerges from his private elevator,
     is greeted as usual:

                    JENIFER
          Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

                    PARRISH
          Good morning, Jennifer.

                    JENIFER
          The Board is waiting.

                    PARRISH
          What?

                    JENIFER
          Didn't you call a Board meeting?

     Jennifer sees Parrish is trying to right his balance, she
     knows better than to press the point.

                    JENIFER (cont'd)
          Yes, the members are waiting.  They
          are in the Board room now.

     Jennifer nods respectfully as Parrish doesn't cast a flicker
     of any further surprise, heads straight for the Board room,
     Joe right beside him.

     INT. BOARD ROOM, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, includ-
     ing Drew, Quince and Sloane.

                    PARRISH
          Good morning.

     An odd mixture of responses, the Board sheepish and at the
     same time looking their most dutiful at this odd meeting,
     its sudden convening clearly a problem for Parrish, a prob-
     lem which he does not attempt to hide, only control.

                    DREW
          Did you want to have a cup of coffee
          or something, Bill?

                    PARRISH
          I don't think so.  Do you?

     Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out
     all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew.

                    DREW
               (to Parrish)
          To get to the point, we have re-
          ceived new information from John
          Bontecou concerning his desires for
          this company to merge with his, and
          we wanted to set the details before
          you.

     A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it
     appears he may not ever answer.

                    PARRISH
          That's it?

                    DREW
          Bontecou wants a quick response
          and --

                    PARRISH
          The answer is no, quick enough for
          you?

                    DREW
          Don't you want to hear the details?

                    PARRISH
          I'm not interested in the details.
          And I'm not interested in the big
          picture either.  What I am inter-
          ersted in is how my Board got conven-
          ed behind my back, is entertaining a
          further proposal from a man whom it
          offends me to do business with,
          moreover has the audacity to present
          this to me like a prize fish, and I
          am expected to clap for it like a
          performing seal.  No, thank you.

                    DREW
          So I am to understand from your re-
          sponse that you do not want to hear
          the details of Bontecou's offer?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, you are to understand that, and
          now may I ask you a question?

                    DREW
          Certainly, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          Are you running this Board or am I?

     Sloane leans in.

                    SLOANE
          We're not getting anywhere here.
          Why don't we take some of the best
          out of this thing, let's consider
          it coolly, let's take a week --

                    DREW
          Bontecou wants a speedier response
          than that.

                    SLOANE
          He'll wait --

                    PARRISH
          Doesn't need to.  Today, tomorrow,
          a week from now -- 'a week from
          now', who can think about a week
          from now -- the answer is going to
          be the same -- a loud, unmistakable,
          all-inclusive, airtight -- 'No'.

     A BUZZ amongst the Board, they finally rustle into silence
     under Parrish's withering glance.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          That's it?  I've got a busy day
          and this meeting has already set
          me behind.  Shall we adjourn?

                    DREW
          Before we do, while we're here,
          there is a second question the
          Board would like a response to,
          a far simpler one.

     Parrish waits.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Who is the man sitting to the right
          of you?

     Everybody's eyes are on Joe.

                    PARRISH
          I've already introduced Mr. Black to
          you all.

                    DREW
          But who is he?  What are his creden-
          tials?  What is his relationship to
          you?

     No response from Parrish.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          The feeling of the Board is this: we
          fear Mr. Black is not only influenc-
          ing your decisions in regard to this
          company, but that you are relying on
          him to make them for you.

     Quince flinches at these words, his hands clasped in front
     of him, his knuckles white as Parrish regards Drew, but still
     does not answer.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          The lack of response, Bill, is not
          appropriate.  We are your Board, we
          have a right to know how you are
          managing the operations of this
          company, and most importantly, that
          you have not delegated someone to do
          it for you.

     Parrish squirms, desperately uncomfortable but still does
     not speak.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Okay, one more time.

     Drew regards Joe.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Who is Joe Black?

     Parrish stares stoically into the middle distance as
     Quince's head sinks into his hands.

                    DREW (cont'd)
               (to the Board)
          A motion has been brought before
          the Board to invoke Article 19 of
          the corporate charter.

                    PARRISH
          In English, please.

                    DREW
          Mandatory retirement upon our
          Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.

     Parrish is expressionless.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          At which time, the Chairman will be
          named Emeritus, he will be welcome
          to attend all meetings, and will
          serve as International Spokesman for
          the corporation plus, of course, a
          settlement, a golden parachute of
          such magnitude that his feet will
          never touch the ground.

     Drew pauses.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Please indicate your vote by a "Yes"
          or "No".

     A "Yes" is heard, now another "Yes", now more "Yes"es, all
     reluctant, "No" from Sloane, "No" from Quince who realizes
     he is the instrument of Parrish's dismissal.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          The motion is passed.  We will of
          course delay the announcement, out
          of respect for our former Chairman,
          until after the celebration of his
          birthday this weekend.

                    PARRISH
          Thank you for allowing me to save
          face, Drew.

     Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew.

                    DREW
               (to the Board)
          The other motion before us is the
          acceptance of John Bontecou's offer
          to merge this corporation with
          Bontecou International --

     Parrish stands, Drew stops speaking.

                    PARRISH
          Joe?

     Silence, then Joe rises.

                    JOE
               (to the Board)
          Who I am, and my relationship to
          Bill, will be divulged in our own
          good time.

     Joe follows Parrish out of the room.

     INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE BOARD ROOM - DAY

     Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe.

                    SLOANE
               (to Parrish)
          ...It's not over, 'til it's over.

                    PARRISH
          Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings"
          shit.

                    SLOANE
          I still sense some doubt in this
          group, we could turn it around.
          You'll be up in the country?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, the big 'celebration' of my
          mandatory retirement birthday.
          You're an honored guest, Eddie.

                    SLOANE
          I'm going to stick it out here.  We
          still have a shot.

     The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the
     door closes, leaving Sloane behind.

     INT. HALLWAY, PARRISH COMMUNICATIONS - DAY

     The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have
     lingered, exchanging post-mortems.  And enraged Quince has
     cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others.

                    QUINCE
          What have you done?  You've gotten
          the old man fired!

                    DREW
          That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was
          wobbling, mind you, but you stupid
          the coup de grace.

     Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality.

                    QUINCE
          I'm going to put a stop to this!

                    DREW
          Quince, you can't unscramble
          scrambled eggs.

                    QUINCE
          But I didn't mean to do it!

                    DREW
          The train's left the station, pal,
          and you're aboard.  Would you like
          to hear the silver lining?  Check
          that, gold.  I've been working with
          John Bontecou all along.  We had
          a game plan -- acquire Parrish
          Communications then break it apart
          and peddle it piece-by-piece to the
          highest bidder.  I set it up for
          him, he smacks it out of the park.

     Quince is struck dumb.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          Don't you know what this'll mean?
          You'll be rich.  You'll sell your
          stock, you can stop kissing ass --
          What'll it feel like to be a man?

                    QUINCE
          I don't want to get rich this way --
          I'm going to expose you.

                    DREW
          Go right ahead.  Tell William
          Parrish how you betrayed him at
          a secret Board meeting.  And tell
          Allison how you got her father
          fired -- and he lost his company.

     Quince goes ashen.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          It's just life, Quin-cee.

     Drew hails an employee across the hall.

                    DREW (cont'd)
               (to Quince)
          Wake up and smell the thorns.

     Drew joins the employee as Quince slumps against the wall.

     INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

     Parrish enters, Joe right behind him, Coyle takes their coats,
     disappears.  Parrish hesitates for a moment, shrugs as if he
     has a thought he doesn't want to share, then heads upstairs
     with Joe.  He is trudging a bit, Joe senses his mood.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry, Bill --

                    PARRISH
          That's okay.

                    JOE
          What's okay?

                    PARRISH
          Just a manner of speaking.

     Joe seems puzzled.

                    PARRISH
               (cont'd)
          What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's
          over.  We've got bigger fish to fry,
          don't we, Joe?

                    JOE
          'Fish'?

                    PARRISH
          Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going
          to take a nap.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Are you hungry?  Coyle will have
          Luisa fix you something to eat.

                    JOE
          I'm not hungry.

                    PARRISH
          Then I can't help you.

     Parrish turns into his bedroom, closing the door gently
     behind him.  Joe continues down the hall, enters the guest
     wing.

     INT. GUEST SUITE, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - DAY

     Midday sunlight streams into the sitting room, Joe passes
     through to his bedroom, sits tentatively on the bed, feels
     the edge of the silk spread, touches the pillow, then rises
     again, crosses back to the sitting room.

     Susan appears in the doorway, Joe suddenly senses her, turns
     around.

                    SUSAN
          You're here?

                    JOE
          I am.

     He stands, they regard each other for the moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          May I take your coat?

     She doesn't answer, starts to take off the coat herself, Joe
     comes around her to help, Susan senses him breathing in the
     scent at the back of her neck.

                    SUSAN
          I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge
          a little lunch, I was in the neigh-
          borhood --

                    JOE
          How beautiful.

     He starts to hang Susan's coat up.

                    SUSAN
          Just throw it on the chair.

     Joe holds her coat carefully on the chair.  An awkward
     moment, the two of them shifting from foot-to-foot.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          When I called, they said that you
          and Daddy had just left the office.

                    JOE
          He's taking a nap.

                    SUSAN
          He must be tired -- this Bontecou
          thing --

                    JOE
          Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.

     A moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          You must be hungry?

     Susan sits on the couch.

                    SUSAN
          No, not anymore.  Are you?

     Joe hears the question but doesn't answer, sits down on the
     couch beside her.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          (after a moment)
          Are you cold?

                    JOE
          ...No.

                    SUSAN
          Maybe it's the draft through the
          door.

     She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
     Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
     other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
     as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
     has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
     instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
     gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
     excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
     very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
     are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
     ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
     are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
     before.

     Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
     ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
     ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
     Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
     of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
     at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
     lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
     is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
     is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
     The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
     the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
     journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
     they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.

     Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:

                    SUSAN
          It's so wonderful to make love to
          you.  It's like making love to some-
          one who has never made love before.

     Joe senses an opportunity not only to admit to what she has
     said, but to tell her more, even the truth about himself.
     He weighs, then resists, the impulse.

                    JOE
          Thank you.

     Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his
     comforting her without knowing that he is doing so.

                    SUSAN
          Did you like making love to me?

                    JOE
          I loved it.

                    SUSAN
          More than you love peanut butter?

                    JOE
          Yes!

     She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers.

     Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for
     the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone
     to some distant, distant land.

                    SUSAN
          Where are you going?

                    JOE
          Nowhere?  I'm...here.

                    SUSAN
          For how long?

                    JOE
          Oh, I hope a long, long time.

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          Me, too.

     Another moment.

                    JOE
          What do we do now?

     She smiles.

                    SUSAN
          It will come to us.

     INT. FOYER, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE (LATER) - DAY

     Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her
     on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss.  The kiss
     lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back
     longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door
     softly after her.

     He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the
     balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.

                    JOE
          Hello, Bill.

     Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Did you have a nice nap?

                    PARRISH
          I couldn't sleep.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry to hear that.

     He starts up the stairs.

                    PARRISH
          No, I'll come down

     Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish
     descends.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          What's going on?

     Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I saw you kiss Susan.

                    JOE
          Yes, I saw you see me.

                    PARRISH
          Well, you're at the wrong place at
          the wrong time with the wrong woman.

                    JOE
          I'll be the judge of that.

                    PARRISH
          I'm her father!

                    JOE
          With all due respect, Bill, I'm not
          asking your permission.

                    PARRISH
          Well, you goddam well should.  You
          walk into my life, give me the worst
          news a guy can get, have me dancing
          on the heads of pins with my busi-
          ness and with my family, and now
          you're spooning with my daughter.

                    JOE
          'Spooning'?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, and stop repeating everything I
          sai, and turning it into a question.
          Spooning, fooling around, God knows
          what.  You arrive on the scene -- why
          you picked me, I still don't under-
          stand --

                    JOE
          I picked you for your verve, your
          excellence, and for your ability to
          - how shall I say - instruct.  You've
          lived a first-rate life.  And I find
          it eminently usable.

     Parrish measures Joe.

                    PARRISH
          What do you want?

     Joe doesn't answer, riveted now on Parrish.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Everybody wants something, Joe.
          You've been taking me from pillar
          to post here.  I thought I knew who
          you were, and it wasn't a whole lot
          of fun, however it was almost bear-
          able.  Now I'm getting something
          else from you, something very, very
          strange -- what is it that you want,
          Joe?

                    JOE
          I'm only following the Parrish
          bywords.  Looking for that 'ounce
          of excitement', that 'whisper of a
          thrill' -- What there is no sense
          living your life without.  You know
          what I mean, Bill.

     Parrish's jaw sets.

                    PARRISH
          You're violating the laws of the
          universe.

                    JOE
          This universe?

                    PARRISH
          Any universe that exists or ever
          existed.  You may be the pro, Joe.
          But I know who you are.  And you're
          all fucked up.

                    JOE
          I don't like your tone, and I don't
          like your references.

                    PARRISH
          And I don't give a shit.

                    JOE
          May I remind you this is not just a
          dispute with a putative suitor, this
          is me.  So watch it...Bill.

                    PARRISH
          Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you
          sonofabitch.

                    JOE
          I told you, 'watch it'.

     Silence.  Now Joe turns on his heel, heads right out the
     front door.  Parrish is left solitary, confounded, staring
     at the closed door.

     INT. EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

     Joe walks down a hallway, a bouquet of flowers in hand,
     looks around the usual feverish activity, he seems lost for
     the moment, but a Receptionist catches his eye.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          Can I help you?

                    JOE
          Dr. Parrish.

                    RECEPTIONIST
          She comes on at 6.

                    JOE
          Oh.

     He looks at the flowers, regards them for a moment, then
     heads for an elevator.

     INT. EASTER'S ROOM, NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY

     Easter is sitting up in bed, hooked up to an TV and moni-
     tors.  She glances over at the doorway, Joe is standing
     there, observing her.  An awkward silence, he looks at
     his flowers again, now sets them respectfully on Easter's
     bedstand.

                    EASTER
          Mistah Bad News.  'Bout time you
          show up.

     Joe speaks to her in the dialect.

                    JOE
          Don' be facety, woman.

                    EASTER
          None facety, mistah.  You come for
          me?  Dat's good news.

                    JOE
          No, I come to see Doctor.

                    EASTER
          Doctor?  What could be wrong wit'
          you?

                    JOE
          Nuthin'.

     Silence, then Easter smiles.

                    EASTER
          Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?

                    JOE
          Yes.

                    EASTER
          My Doctor Lady?

                    JOE
          Mine, too.

     She thinks about this for the moment, Joe grows uncomfort-
     able.

                    EASTER
          You in love?

     Joe seems slightly tormented by the question, Easter senses
     him trying to frame a respect.

                    JOE
          Yah.

                    EASTER
          You loved back?

                    JOE
               I am.

                    EASTER
          She knows you real self?

                    JOE
          She knows how she feel.

                    EASTER
               (scoffing)
          Rass!

                    JOE
               (irritably)
          Don' need you okayin'.

                    EASTER
          Schoolboy tings is you head.
          Badness for you, badness for her,
          badness for me, lyin' here tumor,
          big as breadfruit, poison my inners
          an' waiting.

                    JOE
          Brung you flowers and all I gettin's
          facety back.

                    EASTER
               (stubbornly)
          Only flowers I wan' see's one's
          over my peaceful self restin' in
          the dutty.

                    JOE
          Can do no right by people.  Come to
          take, you wan' to stay, leave you
          stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!

     Silence, Easter waits, watching Joe.

                    EASTER
          You not in you right place, mistah.

     Easter's response stops Joe cold, he looks away and then
     back at her, she had clearly reached him.

                    EASTER (cont'd)
          I ain' either.  No more.  You come
          wi' me now.  Take me.

                    JOE
          But I not lonely here.  Somebody
          want me here.

     Easter considers Joe, she smiles sympathetically.

                    EASTER
          It nice it happen to you.  It like
          you came to Cat Island and you had
          a holiday, sun didn't burn you red,
          just brown, sleep no mosquito eat
          you, rum no poung you head nex' day.
          But trut' is, dat bound to happen,
          you stay long enough.  So tak dat
          nice picture home wi' you, but don'
          be fooled.  We lonely here mostly,
          too.  If we lucky, we got some nice
          pictures.

     Easter drifts into silence, her eyes and Joe's meet, a sense
     they understand each other.  Easter shifts, trying hard to
     ease her discomfort.

                    JOE
               (gently)
          Got enough nice pictured, Easter.

     She looks at him and nods gratefully and closes her eyes.
     Joe watches her, now his eyes close.  Easter exhales
     raspingly, falls still.  The monitors flatline.  A beeping
     alarm sound somewhere down the hall.

     Joe opens his eyes, takes a deep breath, he seems troubled.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          G'bye, sistah.

     She slips out of the room.

     INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

     Parrish is playing solitaire.  The SOUND of the front door
     closing, HEELS crossing the foyer, he looks up, at the foyer
     door is Susan.

                    PARRISH
          Hello, honey.

     He starts to get up, she motions to him to stay, looks
     around now.

                    SUSAN
          Where's Joe?

                    PARRISH
          Joe?

     A silence.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Joe's not around.

                    SUSAN
          Where is he?

                    PARRISH
          I don't know.

     Susan seems distracted.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Why are you looking for Joe?

                    SUSAN
          Because I was sitting in a staff
          meeting, incredibly bored, my mind
          kept wandering and the only place it
          landed was -- Joe.

                    PARRISH
          I don't understand.

                    SUSAN
          Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all
          those things you told me to wait
          for.  Well, they've arrived.

     Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards.

                    PARRISH
          This is crazy --

                    SUSAN
          Why?  A man appears at your side,
          almost never leaves it, you clearly
          trust him, depend on him, I sense
          you value him deeply, why aren't
          those things good enough for me?

                    PARRISH
          You don't know anything about Joe --

                    SUSAN
          What are you afraid of, Dad?  That
          I'll fall head over heels for Joe --
          well, I have -- as you did with Mom.
               (a moment)
          That's always been standard,
          whether you like or not.

     Parrish tries to get hold of himself, changes gear now.

                    PARRISH
          Susan, I don't think Joe is going to
          be with us long.

                    SUSAN
          Where's he going?

                    PARRISH
          I don't know, I can't say --

                    SUSAN
          C'mon!  The guy's working with you.
          You always know chapter and verse
          about everyone who works --

                    PARRISH
          In this case, I can't.  I - uh -- I
          just can't help you.  I only would
          tell you -- that with Joe, you are
          on very, very dangerous ground.

     Susan doesn't answer for a moment.

                    SUSAN
          I love him.

                    PARRISH
          I don't care if you love him!  I'm
          telling you he's no good for you!

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          Of course not, Daddy.  I'm sorry.

     There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a
     word has sunk in.  Parrish slumps.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          I love you, too.

     She kisses Parrish, rearranges one of his ranks of cards,
     shuffles through the deck, turns over the top card, lays
     down a card Parrish needs.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Lightning does strike.

     Parrish watches as Susan turns, disappears out the door.

     EXT. THIRD AVENUE, NEW YORK CITY - TWILIGHT

     Joe walking disconcertedly up the street, bumping shoulders
     with the rush hour crowd, trapped in the life of the city,
     he peers intently at faces, cars, into store windows.  He
     stops now at the window of a Korean grocery, something has
     caught his eye, he steps inside.

     Through the window, Joe can be seen making a purchase, he
     hands the Korean Clerk some money, walks out.

     Joe, back on the street now, unscrews the top of a jar of
     peanut butter, dips a wad out with his fingers.  The Korean
     Clerk runs out after him.

                    CLERK
          Change!  Change!

     Joe stops, uncomprehending.  The Clerk hands Joe bills and
     coins.

                    JOE
          Why are you giving me money?

                    CLERK
          Change.

                    JOE
          I am who I am.  I cannot change.

     Joe tries to hand the money back, but the baffled Clerk
     refuses it.

                    CLERK
          You change!

                    JOE
          That's impossible.  You're wasting
          your money.  I couldn't change even
          if I wanted to.

     The Clerk, exasperated, murmurs something in his language
     and returns to the store.  Joe continues on down the street.

     INT. LIBRARY, PARRISH TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

     Parrish is sitting in a wing chair staring at the fire.  Joe
     appears in the doorway, Parrish doesn't notice him.  Joe
     waits, finally Parrish looks up.  They regard each other.
     Silence.

                    JOE
          Uh --

                    PARRISH
          Yes?

                    JOE
          -- I have the feeling that, all in
          all, what I made this voyage for --
          has served its purpose.

                    PARRISH
          What are you saying, that it's time
          to go?

     Joe doesn't respond, Parrish and Joe measure each other for
     the moment.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I'm ready.

                    JOE
          You are?

                    PARRISH
          Yeah.

                    JOE
          Good.  Tomorrow, after the party.

     Parrish nods, Joe nods back.

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HELICOPTER POV, HUDSON VALLEY - AFTERNOON

     A bird's eye view of the Hudson, over the George Washington
     Bridge, past the widest expanse of the river at the Tappan
     Zee, coming in now over the great lawns and old estates of
     the Upper Hudson Valley, down towards Annadale-on-Hudson
     and the Parrish country estate, which commands a beehive of
     activity, tents and workmen and vehicles.

     EXT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

     The Parrish AStar sets down in its roped-off landing area.
     The Butler runs towards it to open the door, Parrish and
     Joe disembark.  Following the Butler, they make their way
     through the maelstrom: tents being raised, platforms for
     music groups, portable pools with clusters of florists
     leaning over the edge to arrange lily pads within.  Parrish
     and Joe move solemnly, observing the activity, not speaking
     to one another.  Although they are shoulder-to-shoulder,
     there is a distance between them.  They walk on past chan-
     deliers in the garden and fake trees with lights woven
     through their branches.  Adding to the confusion, the AStar
     lifts off, the chandeliers rocking and floral pools rippling
     from the blast of the rotors.  May, the housekeeper, appears.

                    MAY
               (to Parrish)
          Telephone call, sir.  Mr. Sloane
          from New York.

     Parrish nods, starts up for a wing off the main house, Joe
     right at his side.  Parrish stops.

                    PARRISH
          Excuse me.

     Joe, not knowing whether to be affronted or not, hesitates,
     and Parrish strides away.  Joe does not follow.

     INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

     A low-slung but well-appointed room with a writing table, a
     working fireplace, expensive and appropriate Hudson Valley
     prints.

     Parrish enters, clicks on the SPEAKERPHONE, observes the
     party activity through a wide, bow window.

                    PARRISH
          Eddie?

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?

                    PARRISH
          Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why
          are you still down here?

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          The Board's working through the
          weekend, trying up the loose ends
          this damn thing.  But I want to give
          it one more try, I'm still holding
          out some hope.

                    PARRISH
          Eddie, hold out all the hope you
          want but, I promise you, it's hope-
          less, it's over.  Come on up, let's
          get drunk, if I had your shoulder
          to lean on I might actually enjoy
          this --

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          No, I'm going to stay down here,
          keep my finger in the dike and maybe
          by Monday, the waters could recede.

                    PARRISH
          If you're trying to show me lay-
          down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty,
          forget it.

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your
          cake, blow out the candles and make
          a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?

                    PARRISH
          Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for
          the memory.

     Parrish clicks off the SPEAKERPHONE, turns around and looks
     out the window again, the party preparations in full swing,
     colored lights are tested, they flicker on and off.

     EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

     Allison is everywhere, Parrish emerges from his wing, she
     catches his eye immediately, the calm director of a DeMille-
     like epic, politely giving workers instructions, making
     lightning decisions.

     Parrish turns his attention now to an ice-filled fountain
     encircling two giant topiary letters written in faux-
     Cyrillic, a 'B' and a 'P', as rubber-booted delivery men
     carefully arrange giant ice chests of caviar under each
     letter.  A smile creases Parrish's face as, in an unexpected
     lull, Allison backs into him at the fountain.

                    ALLISON
          Hi, Daddy, what do you think?

                    PARRISH
          It's starting to grow on me.  But
          what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?

                    ALLISON
          The fountain is the Caspian Sea and
          the Sea is serving up caviar.  The
          'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for
          Petrossian.  Of course, they also
          stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.

                    PARRISH
          Do they, m'dear?

                    ALLISON
          -- Plus we've got a baritone with a
          balalaika coming from The Russian
          Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a
          Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson
          Eddy songs.

     Parrish shakes his head.

                    PARRISH
          You are amazing.  Why, oh why,
          Allison, are you doing all this?

     But before she can answer, a workman is tugging at Allison's
     sleeve, she turns away from Parrish to give him instructions
     out of Parrish's earshot, and then turns back, they step away
     now, daughter and father, alone.

                    ALLISON
          I do it because I love you.  Because
          everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher-
          ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the
          people who work for you, everybody
          who's ever known you.

                    PARRISH
          Yeah?  And what about my enemies?

                    ALLISON
          They respect you.  Isn't that a kind
          of love?

     Unexpectedly, Allison brushes a lock away from Parrish's
     forehead, with a flick she has rearranged his hair, he
     blinks, a little embarrassed, but having liked it.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          Above all, you've been a wonderful
          father.

                    PARRISH
          I haven't been the father to you
          that --

                    ALLISON
          That you've been to Susan?

                    PARRISH
          I wasn't going to say --

                    ALLISON
          But that's what you were thinking.
          And that's okay.  Because I know you
          love me.  Not like it is with Susan,
          the way your eyes light up when she
          comes in the room and the way she
          always gets a laugh out of you, as
          opposed to me when I walk in a room
          and that look comes over your face,
          "What does she want now?"

     A weather-beaten military parade ground pennant passes, 24th
     Infantry Regiment  "C" (Charlie) Company.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          I already feel I've had everything I
          could have wanted for my birthday --

                    PARRISH
          Hey, there's lots to come.
               (gesturing to me
                activity)
          A little excess -- like you love.

     The preparations are building to a climax, all the elaborate
     plans coming to fruition.

                    PARRISH
          You know, darling, this is going to
          be a wonderful party.

                    ALLISON
               (gently)
          Yes, it is.

     Allison wades into the maelstrom now, Parrish watches her
     go, swarms of purveyors and caterers following her.

     EXT. WINE BAR, LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - AFTERNOON

     Ambrose, the head caterer, is making a last minute check
     of the bar's stock, Quince ambles up, in the background the
     activity has built to a pitch, waiters adjusting their uni-
     forms, purveyors' trucks pulling out in a cloud of dust.

                    QUINCE
          Give me a Seagrams and '7'.

     Ambrose looks at him blankly.

                    QUICNCE (cont'd)
          No got?  Okay a double V.O., water
          back.

                    AMBROSE
          I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr.
          Quince.

                    QUINCE
          Okay, give me a bottle of wine.

                    AMBROSE
          Red or white?

                    QUINCE
          Both.

     Joe appears, looking bewildered, jostled by caterers setting
     up last-minute tables, a drummer from the band rolls his
     traps past on a little cart.  Joe doesn't seem to know where
     he is, when his eyes alight on Quince, he heads for this
     oasis.  Ambrose sets down two bottles of wine and departs.

                    QUINCE (cont'd)
               (to Joe)
          Red or white?

                    JOE
          No, thank you.

     Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of
     each into one glass.

                    QUINCE
          C'mon, have a drink.  You look like
          you need one bad as me.

                    JOE
          Do I?  I'm a little confused.

                    QUINCE
          Confused, huh?  About what?

                    JOE
          Love.

                    QUINCE
          'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles
          of my own.

                    JOE
          You love Allison, don't you?

                    QUINCE
          Oh yes, I do.

                    JOE
          How did you meet?

                    QUINCE
          I was a world-class loser and she
          was a happy, little rich girl --
          and for some reason she took me in.

                    JOE
          But she loves you?

     Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          How do you know?

                    QUINCE
          Because there's nothing we don't
          know about each other and it's okay.
          I mean the deeper, darkest secrets
          -- they don't matter.

                    JOE
          'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?

                    QUINCE
          Yeah, it's like you know every inch
          of each other's souls -- and then
          you're free.

                    JOE
          What do you mean 'free'?

                    QUINCE
          Free to love each other.  Com-
          pletely.  Totally.  No fear.

     Quince seems uncharacteristically within himself.

                    QUINCE (cont'd)
          All that hoopla up there reminds me
          how I will never measure up to a man
          like Bill Parrish - or his daughter.

     He drains his wine.

                    QUINCE (cont'd)
          Do you like me, Joe?

                    JOE
          Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.

                    QUINCE
          What would you say if you knew
          it was me who brought down Bill
          Parrish?
               (a moment)
          I told Drew and the Board that Bill
          depended on you.  Drew led me on,
          but I had no business telling him
          in the first place.  He was setting
          up Bill from day one.  Drew and
          Bontecou are going to chop up the
          company and sell it off for parts.
          Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr.
          Inside.  And I was the fool who made
          it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?

     Joe regards Quince.

                    JOE
          Go to Bill Parrish and tell him
          everything.  He'll forgive you.

     Quince drains one more glass of wine.

                    QUINCE
          You think so?  How do you know?

                    JOE
          Because that's the kind of man Bill
          Parrish is.

     A moment.

                    QUINCE
          Well, maybe... I guess you know him
          better than anybody.

     Another moment.

                    JOE
          -- Getting to.

     The orchestra behind them plays a few riffs, sound checks,
     getting close.

                    QUINCE
          Do you think I should wait to tell
          him 'till after the party?

                    JOE
          No.

     Quince nods anxiously, then smiles gratefully.  They look on
     as the pre-party activities swirl on around them.

     EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET (LATER)

     The moment just before sunset, the last pre-party minutes,
     a procession of guests' cars winding up to the guest house,
     being directed into adjacent fields.  Susan cuts past a re-
     ceiving line that files up the stairs, she skirts the house
     and heads straight for the action, the party on the lawns in
     the rear, climbs a terrace where she commands a view of the
     event on which the curtain is just about to rise.

     EXT. LAWN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

     Guests milling, emerging from the crowd Susan sees, isolated
     by a fountain, Joe.  He looks up towards her, he knows she
     has seen him, they proceed to a rendezvous that has not been
     prearranged but which they intuit.  Susan slants through the
     guests, stopping here and there, excited greetings and cha-
     tter float on the wind, "He, Susie!",  "What a party",  "You
     look great", she keeps moving, a shimmering wraith.

     Joe is on the right coordinate to meet her, his graceful,
     unfailing step carrying him speedily to a destination he is
     not certain of, but where he knows he will find Susan.

     EXT. GARDEN, COUNTRY ESTATE - SUNSET

     The very last rays of the sun setting over the wide expanse
     of river, the light catching Susan and Joe as they enter the
     garden, the party forming behind them, the river flowing in
     front of them.

                    SUSAN
          I like you in a black tie.

                    JOE
          I love you in an evening gown.

                    SUSAN
          It beats a surgical, doesn't it?

     He smiles.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Daddy told me you might be leaving?

                    JOE
          Yes.  Your father and I, our time
          together has come to an end.

                    SUSAN
          Where are you going?

     Joe attempts to answer, but nothing comes out.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          You won't tell me?

                    JOE
          Well -- I --

                    SUSAN
          And you can't tell me who you are.

     Again the same indescribable gesture from Joe.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          I'm in love with a man, I don't know
          who he is, where he's going or when.

                    JOE
          I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.

                    SUSAN
          It gets worse.

                    JOE
          No worse than it gets for me.  I'm
          in love with a woman whom I don't
          want to leave.

                    SUSAN
          Then don't.

     A moment.

                    JOE
          We know so little about each
          other --

                    SUSAN
          We know all that we need to know --

                    JOE
          But there's so much to tell you --

                    SUSAN
          Don't.  That will come later.

                    JOE
          Will it?

                    SUSAN
          Lightning struck.  We caught it in
          a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want
          to be with you, Joe --

     Another moment.

                    JOE
          What will we do?

                    SUSAN
          'Love will find out the way'.

                    JOE
          'Love will find out the way'?

                    SUSAN
          It's a saying.

                    JOE
          I believe that, don't you?

                    SUSAN
          Yes, that's why I said it.

     They are on the brink of some decision, Joe is about to make
     some declaration when Allison is heard --

                    ALLISON (O.S.)
          There you are!

     Allison appears.

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          What's going on here?  Tete-a-tetes
          on my big night?
               (to Susan)
          C'mon honey, you're needed.
               (to Joe)
          Can it wait?

     But before he can answer --

                    ALLISON (cont'd)
          Glad to hear it!
               (to Susan)
          Let's go.

     She takes Susan's arm and marches her off, Joe, in thrall,
     watches them go as the MUSIC erupts behind them, as 'up'
     dance tune, a lilting, catchy melody envelops them all.  The
     curtain has risen on William Parrish's 65th birthday party.

     INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     Quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession,
     Parrish moroses but  philosophical at his desk.

                    QUINCE
          ...what can I say after I say that
          I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've
          zagged, I opened my big mouth one
          too many times, everything got all
          twisted --

                    PARRISH
          It's okay, Quince.  I understand.
          You've always meant well and I
          appreciate that.  Sometimes things
          just turn out -- wrong.

     A KNOCK on the door, it opens, Joe appears.

                    JOE
          Excuse me --

     He starts to step out.

                    QUINCE
          Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you
          -- okay, Bill?

                    PARRISH
          Sure.

     As Joe enters, Quince flashes a warm smile at him.

                    QUINCE
               (to Parrish)
          Joe knew the whole story.  I told
          him.  It was his idea that I come
          clean.  I mean I wanted to come
          clean but he gave me a pair of
          balls, you know what I mean?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, I believe I do.

     Quince now drifts off.

               QUICHE
          Yeah, well -- I can tell you guys
          got business --

                    PARRISH
          No, I'm out of business, right,
          Quince?  However I do have some
          unfinished business -- with Drew.
          Get him out here.  Get him on the
          chopper and get him out here to-
          night.  I want to tell this guy
          how I feel about him face-to-face.

                    QUINCE
          Oh, that could be a tall order, B.P.
          I doubt that Drew's anxious to see
          you face-to-face.

     Joe steps in.

                    JOE
               (to Quince)
          Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges
          that this was a contest and he's
          lost.  The race is to the swift,
          but could Drew summon a modicum
          of understanding and allow Bill to
          save face.  Tell him Bill wants it
          understood in the business community
          he has merely moved upstairs in his
          own company, and the executive
          continuity is unbroken.  Tonight's
          the night to do it.  He'll introduce
          Drew to his press friends as well as
          some of his close acquaintances from
          Washington and Drew can tell them
          that everything's sailing along just
          fine.

     Parrish is impressed by Joe's acumen, a look of grudging
     admiration.  He nods to Joe, summarizes:

                    PARRISH
               (to Quince)
          All in all, what Bill wants to do is
          build the golden bridge to Drew with
          no hard feelings.

                    QUINCE
          You think Drew will go for it?

                    PARRISH
          Quince, I've got confidence in you.

                    QUINCE
          Sir, I'll deliver the package.

     He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent.

                    PARRISH
          Thanks.

                    JOE
          Not at all.

     A moment.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          How are you doing?

                    PARRISH
          What the hell do you care?

                    JOE
          I was just asking, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          You 'want to know', I'll tell you.
          You're looking at a man who tonight
          is not about to walk through the
          Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's
          galloping into it.  And the same time,
          the business he built with his own
          hands and his own head is being
          commandeered by a couple of cheap
          pirates.  And, oh yes, I almost
          forgot, my daughter's fallen in
          love with Death.

     Another moment.

                    JOE
          -- And I'm in love with your
          daughter.

                    PARRISH
          Say again?

                    JOE
          I'm in love with your daughter, and
          I'm taking her with me tonight.

     Parrish is stunned.

                    PARRISH
          You're what?

                    JOE
          I think you heard me, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          You're not taking Susan anywhere.
          And what the hell does that mean
          anyway?

     Joe doesn't answer for a moment.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I thought we had a deal.

                    JOE
          I'm sorry, Bill --

                    PARRISH
          Susan is my daughter, she has a
          wonderful life ahead of her and
          you're going to deprive her of
          it and you're telling me you're
          sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology
          not accepted.

                    JOE
          I love her, Bill.  She is all that
          I ever wanted, and I've never wanted
          for anything because I've never
          wanted anything before, if you can
          understand.

                    PARRISH
          How perfect for you -- to take
          whatever you want because it
          pleases you.  It's not love --

                    JOE
          Then what is it?

                    PARRISH
          Some aimless infatuation in which,
          for the moment, you feel like in-
          dulging.  It's missing everything
          that matters.

                    JOE
          Which is what?

                    PARRISH
          Trust, responsibility, taking the
          weight, for your choices and feel-
          ings and spending the rest of your
          life living up to them.  And above
          all, not hurting the object of your
          love.

                    JOE
          So that's what love is?

                    PARRISH
          Multiply it by infinity and take it
          to the death of forever and you will
          still have barely a glimpse of what
          I am talking about.

                    JOE
          Those were my words, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          Well, they're mine now.

     Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.

                    JOE
          Susan wants to come.  She says she's
          in love with me.

                    PARRISH
          With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you
          tell her who you are?

                    JOE
          No.

                    PARRISH
          Does she know where she's going?

     Joe doesn't answer.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Susan went, in whatever way she did,
          for that poor sonofabitch whose body
          you took, and everything else since
          has been aftermath.  You say you love
          her but you don't know what love is.
          She 'loves' you but she doesn't know
          who you are.  You make a deal, you're
          breaking it -- the bottom line is,
          Joe, you're conducting a Great
          Romance under false pretenses.

                    JOE
          I don't like what you're saying.

                    PARRISH
          I don't expect you to.

                    JOE
          Are you threatening me?

                    PARRISH
          I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan
          from the moment she was born, and I
          love her now, and every minute in
          between, and what I dream of is a
          man who will discover her and she
          will discover a man who will love
          her, who is worthy of her, who is of
          this world, of this time and has the
          grace and compassion and fortitude
          to walk beside her as she makes her
          way through this beautiful thing
          called life.

     Parrish is beginning to reach Joe.

                    JOE
          Are you telling me I can't be
          part of it?

     A pause, Parrish's posture changes.

                    PARRISH
          Why did you come in here and tell
          me, Joe?  You are the Biggest Shot
          of all, you don't have to ask my
          permission, but that's what you're
          doing.  You know why?  Because you've
          somewhere, somehow, developed into a
          good guy, and you know this is all
          wrong... I don't know what you're
          going to do -- how can this be love?
          She doesn't know who you are.  Why
          don't you tell her?  Try it out on
          her?  See what happens.  Reveal
          everything there is to know about
          yourself and let the chips fall
          where they may.

     Joe has received what Parrish has said.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Okay? -- I've given it my best shot.
          I wish I could tell you to sleep on
          it but...

     Parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, Joe
     regards him.

     EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a
     weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself
     until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the
     party.  He drifts into the center and runs right into Susan,
     couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.

                    SUSAN
          Hello, Joe.  What'd you know?

     She smiles.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          There's something so indescribably
          sexy about you in a crowd.  I could
          make love to you right here.

     He hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          If you're going to tell my future,
          you're on the wrong side.

     A moment.

                    JOE
          There is something I do want to tell
          you --

     He stammers into silence.

                    SUSAN
          But you can't.

     Joe is about to respond but doesn't.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Just then -- when you hesitated --
          the way you shift from foot-to-foot,
          I've always found endearing but just
          now -- I got a chill.

     But he drifts again, now she takes his hand.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Remember that morning in the coffee
          shop?  You said 'What's wrong with
          taking care of a woman, she takes
          care of you --"

                    JOE
          Did I say that?

                    SUSAN
          And I said you'd have a hard time
          finding a woman like that.

     Joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Well, you've found one, Joe.

                    JOE
          The 'coffee shop' --

                    SUSAN
          -- That was the place... and you were
          the guy.

     Joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          And you said you didn't want me to
          be your doctor because you didn't
          want me to examine you --?
               (a moment)
          Well, I got to examine you after
          all --

     Joe blinks, at a loss.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          I could come with you --

                    JOE
          I - uh --

                    SUSAN
          You want me to wait for you, you'll
          be back --

     Joe doesn't answer, Susan is suddenly anxious.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          Why do I want this night to last
          forever?

                    JOE
          Don't you know, that's what I want
          more than anything.

     He touches her face.

                    SUSAN
          You said before you couldn't tell me
          who or where, only the 'when' -- Is
          when now?

     A moment.

                    JOE
          May I kiss you?

     She waits.  He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.

                    SUSAN
          That felt like a goodbye.

     Joe's silence is heavy.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          What's going on, Joe?  I feel like
          we're lifting off --

                    JOE
          I'm still here.

                    SUSAN
          But you're not.  You're somewhere
          else.
               (a moment)
          You're someone else --

     Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he
     drifts into a long silence.  Susan is beside herself, her
     emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her.

                    SUSAN
          Tell me you love me -- tell me
          you love me now --

                    JOE
          I love you now, I'll love you
          always --

                    SUSAN
          Hold me --

     He holds on tight to her.  They are desperately entwined
     until finally she releases him.

                    JOE
          Susan --

                    SUSAN
          -- Yes?

                    JOE
          Thank you for loving me.

     She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her.

     INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party
     flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted,
     the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself.

     Joe enters, Parrish looks up.

                    JOE
          ...We should think about getting
          started, Bill.

     Parrish waits.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          It'll just be us.

     The tension in Parrish's body releases, he takes a breath.

                    PARRISH
          Thank you.

     Joe nods an acknowledgement, but his face reflects his pain.
     Parrish regards him sympathetically.

     The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door.  Parrish, out
     of politeness to Joe, does not respond.

                    QUINCE (O.S.)
          Bill --?

     After a moment.

                    PARRISH
          Come in.

     Quince appears, flushed with excitement.

                    QUINCE
          -- I got him.  The chopper's two
          minutes away.

     Parrish weighs the information for a moment.

                    PARRISH
               (to Joe)
          How are we on time?

     Joe shrugs, nods gently.

                    JOE
          Okay.

                    PARRISH
               (to Quince)
          Get him in here.

     Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker-
     phone.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          ...May? -- I know you're busy,  but I
          want you to put in a call to Eddie
          Sloane for me --

                    MAY (O.S.)
          At home, sir --?

                    PARRISH
          No, he's at the office.

     EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     An area on the fringe of the party, the helicopter blades
     stop spinning.  Quince hurries to the aircraft door, opens
     it and Drew steps out.  Quince leads the way through the
     lights and MUSIC.  Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for
     himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the
     irony.

                    DREW
          This is damn big of Bill, I also
          think it's smart.

                    QUINCE
          He had no choice.  You're a
          formidable adversary.

                    DREW
          He said that?

                    QUINCE
          Well, you've got him by the short-
          hairs.

                    DREW
          Yeah, the short, gray hairs.

     He flashes a pleased-as-punch greeting to some unseen
     acquaintance as they press on to Parrish's study.

     INT. PARRISH'S STUDY, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room.

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          We're all here, Bill --

                    PARRISH
          I appreciate this, Eddie, members
          of the Board, this will just take a
          minute of your time.  As the custo-
          dians of the company, you may re-
          ceive information from what follows
          that is valuable to you --
               (a moment)
          -- or not.  Either way, thanks.

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
               (speakerphone)
          We're all ears.

     Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and
     closes the door behind him.

                    DREW
          Hi, Bill, happy birthday --

     A moment.

                    DREW (cont'd)
          I just wanted to say how appre-
          ciative I am of this - uh - grand
          gesture and --

                    PARRISH
          Shut up and sit down.

     Drew takes a seat.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          You're a worthless sack of shit, you
          fucked me over, played footsie with
          John Bontecou, sold my company out
          to line your own pockets.

                    DREW
          I don't know where you get that idea
          -- the Board agreed --

                    PARRISH
          The Board didn't know you're a mole
          who burrowed inside so you could bury
          us all.

                    DREW
          Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another
          one of his whoppers?  Aren't you
          sick of this asshole lurking around?
          No one knows who he is, but one
          thing everyone does know, he somehow
          got your ear and has been pouring
          poison into it ever since.

     Joe can no longer control himself.

                    JOE
          You're the poison, Drew.  You've
          operated behind-the-scenes to suborn
          the trust of a man who has stamped
          you with his imprimatur of class and
          elegance and stature.  I've seen all
          kinds and degrees of deception in my
          time, but Bill Parrish has been on
          the receiving end of machinations so
          Machiavellian that it has rarely
          been my experience to encounter.  And
          yet he has combatted them stoically,
          and selflessly, without revealing my
          identity.  Had he violated the vow
          of secrecy he took, his task would
          have been far easier, he could have
          turned defeat into victory, but he
          is too honorable a man to have done
          that.  And now I must release him
          from that vow.  Because of me, he
          has lost his work, his company, his
          reputation -- and now he's going to
          tell you who I am.

     Parrish is struck dumb.  He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking
     his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and
     then commandingly.

                    DREW
               (to Parrish)
          So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in
          my pants.

                    JOE
          -- And now you're going to pee some
          more.

                    PARRISH
          Joe, don't do this --

                    JOE
          It's time to put this person where
          he belongs.

                    PARRISH
          It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's
          going to step aside --

                    DREW
          I'm not stepping anywhere --

                    JOE
          I appreciate your gentlemanliness,
          Bill, but what we need to do here is
          drive the dagger home --

                    DREW
          The dagger --?

                    PARRISH
          I told you to shut up.

                    JOE
               (to Drew)
          Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --

                    PARRISH
          He is --

                    JOE
          I'll take it from here --
               (to Drew)
          I am --

                    PARRISH
          -- An IRS man.

     Drew is stunned, Joe glances at Parrish, hesitates.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Yes, he is.  He's an -- IRS man.
          Aren't you, Joe?

     Joe is at a loss, Parrish's eyes are glued to his, Joe gets
     the hint.

                    JOE
          Yes, I am.
               (to Drew)
          IRS man.

     Drew's head swivels from Joe to Parrish and back again.

                    PARRISH
          The Treasury Department asked
          my cooperation in his undercover
          investigation of John Bontecou.
          They were convinced that Bontecou,
          on past deals, had structured his
          mergers and acquisitions in sus-
          picious and complicated ways so as
          to evade paying the taxes he is
          liable for.  The IRS wanted to go
          after him, and this deal offered
          them the opportunity.
               (a moment)
          I agreed to cooperate.

                    JOE
               (to Parrish)
          And we're very grateful.

                    PARRISH
          Moreover, Agent Joe Black here --
          of course that's not his real name
          -- smelled out your involvement,
          Drew.  He developed evidence you
          were working both sides of the
          fence.  Unfortunately, that's known
          as a conflict of interest --

                    JOE
          Undisclosed conflict of interest --

                    PARRISH
          An offense --

                    JOE
          An indictable offense.

     Silence.

                    DREW
          I think I'd like to talk to my
          lawyer --

                    PARRISH
          No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to
          offer you a deal.

     Drew is all attention.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Confess to the Board every details of
          your participation and then submit
          your resignation.

                    DREW
          And what do I get?

                    PARRISH
          You get not to go to jail.

                    DREW
          You're talking through your hat.
          You're offering a deal because
          you've got no proof.

                    PARRISH
          Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.

                    JOE
               (to Drew)
          And he's talking through his lips.

     Joe steps forward.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          Make no mistake, Drew, if you choose
          to test my resolve in this matter,
          you'll be looking at an outcome that
          will have a finality that is beyond
          your comprehension, and you'll not
          be counting the days or the months
          or the years, but millenniums in the
          house with no doors.

     Drew slumps.

                    DREW
          All right, you win.  As soon as I
          get back to the city, I'll meet with
          the Board.

     Sloane's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE.

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
          You're meeting with the Board right
          now, Drew.  Resignation accepted.
          Moreover, I propose a motion to re-
          confirm William Parrish as Chairman
          of the Board of Parrish Communica-
          tions as well as a rejection of the
          merger with Bontecou International.
          How say you, Board?

     A chorus of thunderous "Yes"es resounds through the
     SPEAKERPHONE.

                    SLOANE (O.S., cont'd)
          The motion is passed.

                    PARRISH
          Well, thank you, that's great, but
          it's more than I bargained for.  I
          just wanted to set the record
          straight.

                    SLOANE (O.S.)
          But we want you back, Bill.  Mean-
          while, enjoy your party, celebrate,
          we'll attend to the nasty details.
          And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.

                    JOE
          My pleasure.  This is an IRS Agent's
          dream.  I'll be promoted to Chief of
          Section off of this.

     Parrish clicks the speakerphone off.  Drew is staring at
     Joe, shaking his head.

                    DREW
          Who would've ever believed it?  You,
          an IRS Agent --

     Silence.  Joe shrugs, smiles.

                    JOE
          'Death and Taxes'.

     The door flies open, an anxious Allison appears.

                    ALLISON
          Daddy!  We've been looking all over
          for you - this is your party - what
          are you doing in here?  Never mind.
          You're on.  Let's go.

     She pulls him out of his chair, hustles him out of the room,
     Joe right behind them.

     EXT. LAWNS, COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

     The guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the
     orchestra strikes up "Happy Birthday" as Parrish appears
     with Allison.  An enormous cake is unveiled with one great,
     lit candle, Parrish beams then laughs.  He pauses over the
     cake, now blows the candle out.  APPLAUSE, cries of "Speech!
     Speech!", Parrish tries to demur but the request becomes
     loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the
     crowd.  Joe observes from the fringe.

                    PARRISH
               (to the guests)
          I thought I was going to sneak away
          tonight...

     YELLS of "No!"  "Never!"

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          ...What a glorious night, every
          face I see is a memory.  It may not
          be a perfectly perfect memory --
          sometimes we had our ups and downs
          -- but we're all together, and
          you're mine for a night.
               (a moment)
          -- And I'm going to break precedent,
          and tell you my one-candle wish --
          that you would have a life as lucky
          as mine, where you can wake up one
          morning and say "I don't want
          anything more."
               (another moment)
          Sixty-five years - don't they go by
          in a blink?

     Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows
     into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune.  Quince
     grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back.  Now
     Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they
     hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated
     by a surge of guests.  Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but
     there is a tinge of sadness about her.  He heads towards her,
     they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.

                    SUSAN
          What a night.

                    PARRISH
          I'm having a helluva time.

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          You were right about Joe, he is
          going somewhere --

                    PARRISH
               (gently)
          I'm sorry.

     Susan is examining Parrish very closely.

                    SUSAN
          Are you relieved?

                    PARRISH
          Yes, but --

     Parrish hesitates.

                    SUSAN
          But what?

                    PARRISH
          I want you to know how much I love
          you.  That you've given a meaning
          to my life that I had no right to
          expect, and that no one can ever
          take from me.

                    SUSAN
          Daddy --

                    PARRISH
          No -- I love you so much and I want
          you to promise me something.  I
          don't want you to ever worry about
          me.  If anything should happen, I'm
          going to be fine and everything's
          going to be all right.
               (a moment)
          -- And I have no regrets.

     Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          And I want you to feel that way,
          too.

                    SUSAN
          I love you, Daddy --

                    PARRISH
          That's why it's okay.

     They drift into silence.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          No regrets?

     After a moment.

                    SUSAN
          'No regrets'.

     A long silence, Susan smiles.

                    PARRISH
          It's a good feeling, isn't it?

     Silence again.

                    SUSAN
          Everybody's saying goodbye...

     They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an
     understanding.

                    PARRISH
          I'm still here.
               (a moment)
          Would you like to dance with me,
          Susan?

                    SUSAN
          Oh, yes --

     He starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.

                    PARRISH
          If you don't mind dancing with an
          old fogey like me.

                    SUSAN
          Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll
          never be old.

     He takes her in his arms and they dance away.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still
     commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe.  His eyes are on
     Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully.
     A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops.

                    WAITER
          Can I get you anything, sir?

     Joe regards the Waiter for a moment.

                    JOE
          Do you have any peanut butter?

     The Waiter hesitates.

                    WAITER
          I don't think so, sir.

                    JOE
          Thank you, anyway.

     The Waiter moves off.  Joe's attention returns to Parrish and
     Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     On the dance floor.

                    PARRISH
          What was that?

                    SUSAN
          The fireworks are about to start.

     Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
               (to Parrish)
          Shall we?

                    PARRISH
          You go ahead, honey, I'm going to
          catch my breath.

     Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close.  She looks at
     him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she
     smiles back.  Now she heads out with the crowd for the
     fireworks.  When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns
     and heads up towards Joe.

     Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches.

                    JOE
          Happy Birthday, Bill.

                    PARRISH
          Thank you.

     They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks.
     Joe's gaze lingers.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Did you say goodbye?

                    JOE
          Not exactly.

                    PARRISH
          I guess you have your reasons.

                    JOE
          Yes.

     Silence.

                    PARRISH
          Now that we have a moment, would you
          mind if I expressed my gratitude for
          what you did for Susan?

     Joe waits.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          I never heard her speak of any man
          as she spoke of you -- It was always
          what I wanted for her -- but what
          happens to her now?

                    JOE
          I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.
          These things have a way of working
          out.

     Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish
     has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues:

                    JOE (cont'd)
          And would you mind if I expressed my
          gratitude...?

     Parrish waits.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          For you.  For the time you've given
          me.  For the person you are.

     A moment.

                    PARRISH
          Don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll
          ruin my autopsy.

     Joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the
     crowd below, searching.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          It's hard to let go, isn't it?

                    JOE
          Yes.

                    PARRISH
          That's life.  What can I tell you?

     A silence, an understanding there is another more to say.
     Joe looks inquiringly at Parrish as if to say "Shall we?",
     Parrish nods and Joe turns with him.  They set off now away
     from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
     the river.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
     fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
     isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
     powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
     distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-
     thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
     her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
     fireworks.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Up the hill Parrish's step slows, Joe slowing with him.

                    PARRISH
          I'm getting a little dizzy, I can
          feel my heart pumping --

     But Parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on
     up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, Joe in step
     with him.

                    PARRISH (cont'd)
          Should I be afraid?

     Joe stops, Parrish stops with him.

                    JOE
          Not a man like you.

     Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides
     out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue
     on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage
     of fireworks lights up the sky.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
     up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
     now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
     walks up towards the hill.

     Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
     over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
     He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
     seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
     pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
     keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.

                    SUSAN
          Joe...?

     He smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right
     in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so
     appealing.  They are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet
     close.

                    SUSAN (cont'd)
          You're here...

     He is trying to get his bearings.

                    JOE
          -- You bet.

     Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative.

                    SUSAN
          Where did you go?

     Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of
     time and place.

                    JOE
          I don't know -- y'know, I don't know
          -- it's all blurred up and hazy.  And
          would y'know what I mean if I said I
          don't think it's worth figuring out?

     Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her
     lightheaded.

                    JOE (cont'd)
          ...But now I'm back.

     Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an
     answer.

                    SUSAN
               (gently)
          That's it?

                    JOE
          Well, I don't know what else to say.
          It's a helluva party --

                    SUSAN
          You think so?

                    JOE
          Yeah...and you're the prettier
          thing here.

     Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
     jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
     regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
     with the last moments fades away.

     Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
     a sudden intake of breath.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Hey, you all right?

     His hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her
     support.

                    SUSAN
          The coffee shop --

     The Young Man nods, pleased with her recognition.

                    YOUNG MAN
          I asked you if I said something
          wrong and you said it was so right
          it scared you.

     Susan holds herself very still.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          And forgive me for saying this --
          but then you said -- and it's been
          with me ever since --

                    SUSAN
          What has --?

     He hesitates.

                    YOUNG MAN
          You said you liked me.

                    SUSAN
          No --

                    YOUNG MAN
          Y'didn't?

     A moment.

                    SUSAN
          I said I liked you so much.

     She falls silent now, overcome by the last moments'
     revelations.  The Young Man senses her discomfort which
     is on the edge of pain.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Hey, everything's going great --
          don't y'think?

     She doesn't answer for a moment.

                    YOUNG MAN (cont'd)
          Don't you feel that way?

                    SUSAN
          ...We know so little about each
          other.

                    YOUNG MAN
          But we've got time.

     She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open,
     completely vulnerable, waiting for her response.  A long
     silence, the words come out haltingly:

                    SUSAN
          I wish you could've known my
          father...

     Another moment.

                    YOUNG MAN
          Me, too.

     Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are
     completely intent on each other.

                    SUSAN
          ...What do we do now?

     A long silence.

                    YOUNG MAN
          It will come to us.

     Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes
     up from below, the night fills with light.  The Young Man
     searches Susan's face, now takes her hand -- and together
     they start back towards the party.

     THE END
