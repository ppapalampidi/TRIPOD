               EXT. FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE

               A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

               A CRACK OF THUNDER!

               On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as we 
               knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF 
               LIGHTNING.

               MUSIC: AN EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY begins to PLAY in the 
               b.g.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle. It is completely 
               dark, except for one room -- a study in the corner of the 
               castle -- which is only lit by candles.

               Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the study.  
               We LOOK IN and SEE:

               INT. STUDY - NIGHT

               An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.

               As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW...

               A CLOCK BEGINS TO CHIME: "ONE," "TWO," "THREE," "FOUR..." We 
               are ALMOST FACING the front of the coffin. "FIVE," "SIX," 
               "SEVEN," "EIGHT..."

               The CAMERA STOPS. Now it MOVES UP AND ABOVE the satin-lined 
               coffin. "NINE," "TEN," "ELEVEN," "T W E L V E!"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE EMBALMED HEAD OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN

               Half of still clings to the waxen balm; the other half has 
               decayed to skull. Below his head is a skeleton, whose bony 
               fingers cling to a metal box.

               A HAND

               reaches in to grasp the metal box. It lifts the box halfway 
               out of the coffin -- the skeleton's fingers rising, 
               involuntarily, with the box.

               Then, as of by force of will, the skeleton's fingers grab 
               the box back and place it where it was.

               Now the "Hand" -- using its other hand -- grabs the box back 
               from the skeleton's fingers. The skeleton no longer resists.

               CORNELIUS WALDMAN

               whose "Hands" we have just seen, now carries the box to a 
               small table. He takes a tiny key out from his vest pocket 
               and begins to unlock the metal box.

               NINE PEOPLE watch him closely. They are seated on chairs in 
               the study, waiting to hear the contents of Beaufort 
               Frankenstein's will. Their dress is turn-of-the-century 
               Transylvanian.

               Cornelius Waldman fumbles with the lock, emitting strange 
               grunts as he tries to open it. With each grunt, the face of 
               a "potential Heir" is SEEN, squirming with frustration or 
               anger.

                                     FIRST VILLAGER (WALTER)
                         Fumbling fool! For two kronen I'd 
                         rip that box fight out of his hands.

                                     ILSE (HIS WIFE)
                         Shhh!

                                     NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER (HENRICH)
                         Hurry. Idiot, hurry!

                                     AGATHA (HIS WIFE)
                         Quiet, Henrich! We've waited seventy 
                         years... another three or four seconds 
                         won't hurt.

                                     NINETY-YEAR-OLD VILLAGER
                         Another three of four more seconds? 
                         I could be dead by then.

                                     AGATHA
                         Shhh!

                                     FIFTH VILLAGER (A MAN)
                         What if he's left you out?

                                     HELENE (HIS GIRL FRIEND)
                         Just let him try -- I'll take care 
                         of him.

                                     ANASTASIA (A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
                         Oh, Mommy...I hardly remember. Did 
                         the Baron really like me when I was 
                         a child?

                                     MARLENE (HER MOTHER)
                         Like a father!

                                     NINTH VILLAGER (WOLFGANG)
                              (muttering to himself)
                         Wenn dieser Bloder kerl sich nicht 
                         beeilt verde ich verruckt. Was zum 
                         Teufel machte?

                                     MARLENE
                         Shhh!

               Cornelius Waldman finally opens the lock. He takes out an 
               old parchment, puts on his glasses, coughs and sputters a 
               few times, and then begins to read.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         'I, Beaufort Frankenstein, in this 
                         my eighty third year of life, do 
                         hereby make, publish and declare the 
                         following statements as and for my 
                         last will and testament, and I direct 
                         my executor, Cornelius Waldman, to 
                         inform and assemble those persons 
                         previously divulged to him, that 
                         they may hear -- in my own voice -- 
                         the final disposition of my property.'

               At the words, "In my own voice," the nine "Potential Heirs" 
               exchange curious glances.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                              (still reading)
                         'Such disposition to commerce at the 
                         hour of twelve o'clock of my one 
                         hundredth birthday. If all the 
                         conditions heretofore set forth have 
                         been met, now then -- hear once more, 
                         and for the last time...the 
                         authenticity of my own voice!'

               Cornelius Waldman nos to a Clerk, HERR FALKSTEIN, who is 
               standing nearby.

               Herr Falkstein places the needle of an old victrola onto an 
               already spinning record. It SCRATCHES and then begins to 
               PLAY.

                                     VOICE OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN
                              (o.s.)
                         How do you do this thing? Where? In 
                         here?  Just talk right into it? All 
                         right. Am I close enough?  All right, 
                         all right -- get the hell out of the 
                         way.
                              (He clears his throat, 
                              then speaks in a 
                              deep, majestic voice)
                         The once proud name of Frankenstein 
                         has been dragged, by my only son, 
                         Victor, into an abyss of shame. There 
                         was a time when the name 
                         'Frankenstein' conjured dreams of 
                         virtue, of honor and devotion. Now, 
                         no guilt, no malignity, no misery 
                         can be found to equal mine. And the 
                         catalogue of sins of my once devoted 
                         son will not cease to rankle in my 
                         wounds until death shall close them 
                         forever -- so supremely frightful is 
                         the effect of any human endeavor to 
                         mock the stupendous mechanism of the 
                         Creator of the world. Did you get 
                         all that? Are you sure you got 'rankle 
                         in my wounds'? I'll kill you if you 
                         screw this up. All right, all right. 
                         Now as to the disposition of my 
                         estate.

               Everyone in the room sits alert.

                         Herr Falkstein! Did you inform 
                         Frederick Frankenstein of this 
                         assembly and all the particulars of 
                         the time and place?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         I did, sir.

               He takes a cablegram out from his pocket.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         But I received a cable only this 
                         morning, saying that he could not 
                         come.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         Was he aware of the importance of 
                         this occasion?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was 
                         obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins 
                         University.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         What lecture could be more important 
                         than the will of Baron Beaufort 
                         Frankenstein?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                              (reading the cable)
                         'Functional areas of the cerebrum in 
                         relation to the skull.'

                              (very sweetly)
                         Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me 
                         for interrupting. But is Frederick, 
                         then... a medical doctor?

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         Yes, my dear, he is.

                                     ANASTASIA
                         And has he achieved... any special 
                         degree of eminence?

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         He is the fifth leading authority in 
                         his field.

                                     ANASTASIA
                              (sinking her head 
                              into her hand)
                         Oh, shit.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         Herr Falkstein -- you must go at 
                         once and present Dr. Frankenstein 
                         with all the details of his 
                         inheritance. The estate will provide 
                         for your journey.

                                     HELENE
                         I object, Herr Waldman! This is a 
                         travesty. If the beloved great-
                         grandson cared anything at all for 
                         the House of Frankenstein, he would 
                         have shown it by being here with 
                         those of us who still have some 
                         respect. I think we should completely 
                         disregard the afterthoughts of a 
                         very old man.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         Madam -- the foundation of 
                         civilization rests upon adherence to 
                         the law. And the Law is the Law. Das 
                         Gesetz ist das Gesetz!

               Wolfgang -- the man who mutters only in German -- CRASHES 
               the back of his head halfway into the wall behind him.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         Herr Falkstein! You have your 
                         instructions!

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     CORNELIUS WALDMAN
                         I have taken an oath that each letter 
                         of this testament shall be executed... 
                         and by God, it shall be done!

               The lid of Beaufort Frankenstein's coffin SLAMS SHUT by 
               itself.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LEGEND ON THE SCREEN

               It reads:

                                  JOHNS HOPKINS HOSPITAL

                                   BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

               INT. MEDICAL ARENA - DAY

               Herr Falkstein quietly enters into the balcony of an arena 
               packed with young MEDICAL STUDENTS. A lecture is in progress.

                                     LECTURER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         If we look at the base of a brain 
                         which has just been removed from a 
                         skull, there's very little of the 
                         midbrain that we can actually see.

               Herr Falkstein proceeds, almost on tiptoe, along the aisle 
               towards a vacant seat. He is carrying a briefcase and a small 
               metal box.

                                     LECTURER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Yet, as I demonstrated in my lecture 
                         last week, if the under aspects of 
                         the temporal lobes are gently pulled 
                         apart, the upper portion of the stem 
                         of the brain can be seen.

               Herr Falkstein's footsteps ECHO ever so lightly against the 
               cold stone floor, as he passes the faces of students intense 
               with concentration.

                                     LECTURER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         This so called 'brain stem' consists 
                         of the midbrain, a rounded protrusion 
                         called the pons, and a stalk tapering 
                         downwards called the medulla oblongata 
                         which passes out of the skull through 
                         the foramen magnum and becomes, of 
                         course... the spinal cord.

               Herr Falkstein finds a vacant place and sits down.

                                     LECTURER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Which brings us directly to the 
                         demonstration prepared for today. 
                         Are there any questions before we 
                         proceed?

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                              (rising)
                         I have one question, Dr. Frankenstein.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Our first LOOK at the famous Lecturer.

                                     FREDDY
                         That's 'Fronkonsteen.'

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     FREDDY
                         My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Oh! I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.

                                     FREDDY
                         No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But aren't you the grandson of the 
                         famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... 
                         who performed such fascinating 
                         experiments in electricity and 
                         galvanism?

                                     FREDDY
                         That's true! But my grandfather, 
                         Victor was, after all, what we might 
                         politely refer to as... a cuckoo!

               Polite laughter.

                                     FREDDY
                         I prefer, by far, to be remembered 
                         for my own small contributions to 
                         science. Now if we can proceed to 
                         your questions.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Well sir... I'm not sure I understand 
                         the distinction between 'Reflexive' 
                         and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.

                                     FREDDY
                         Very good! Since our lab work today 
                         is a demonstration of just that 
                         distinction... why don't we proceed?

               Behind Freddy is a PATIENT, lying on an operating table.

               CARLSON, an assistant, stands near the Patient, next to a 
               small table of instruments.

                                     FREDDY
                         What are we actually talking about 
                         when we use the term, 'Brain'? We 
                         are talking about... a cauliflower!

               Freddy turns to Carlson.

                                     FREDDY
                         May I have the cauliflower, please!

               Carlson hands Freddy a giant cauliflower.

                                     FREDDY
                         If we make a small slit, down the 
                         center of this cauliflower...

               Freddy turns to Carlson, who hands him the scalpel. Freddy 
               makes a small slit down the center of the cauliflower.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...and then, ever so gently, gently, 
                         gently... pull it apart...

               Freddy has some difficulty pulling the cauliflower apart.

               It begins to crumble, but he goes on, professionally.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...we should find, with any luck at 
                         all... a stalk of... celery!

               There is no celery inside the cauliflower. Freddy flushes 
               red.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Carlson)
                         Where did you get this cauliflower?

                                     CARLSON
                         From your office, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Didn't you prepare it with the celery 
                         before my lecture?

                                     CARLSON
                         Yes, sir. But I must have taken the 
                         wrong one when we came up.

                                     FREDDY
                              (in quiet rage)
                         Are you trying to make me look like 
                         an idiot?

                                     CARLSON
                         No, sir.  It will never happen again.

                                     FREDDY
                              (handing him the 
                              cauliflower)
                         Here! This cauliflower is useless to 
                         me.

               Freddy turns back to his audience.

                                     FREDDY
                         With any normal cauliflower, we would 
                         have found a stalk of celery, or... 
                         'Brain Stem' which brings us to the 
                         practical application of our study.

               Freddy moves behind the Patient on the table.

                                     FREDDY
                         Mr. Hilltop here -- with whom I have 
                         never worked of given any prior 
                         instructions to -- has graciously 
                         offered his services for this 
                         afternoon's demonstration. Mr. 
                         Hilltop!

                                     HILLTOP
                         Yes, sir?

                                     FREDDY
                         Have we ever seen each other before 
                         this afternoon?

                                     HILLTOP
                         No, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Tell them!

                                     HILLTOP
                              (turning to the Medical 
                              Students)
                         No, sir -- we haven't.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to his audience)
                         Do I lie?
                              (to Mr. Hilltop)
                         Would you be so kind enough to hop 
                         up on your feet and stand beside 
                         this table.

               Mr. Hill top gets off of the table and stands erect.

                                     FREDDY
                         Mr. Hilltop!  Would you raise your 
                         left knee, please!

               Mr. Hilltop raises his left knee.

                                     FREDDY
                         You have just witnessed a 'Voluntary' 
                         nerve impulse. It begins as a stimulus 
                         from the cerebral cortex, passes 
                         through the brain stem and then to 
                         the particular muscle involved. Mr. 
                         Hilltop, you may lower your knee.

               He lowers his knee.

                                     FREDDY
                         Reflex movements are those which are 
                         made independently of the will, but 
                         are carried out along pathways which 
                         pass between the periphery and the 
                         central nervous system. You filthy, 
                         rotten, yellow son of a BITCH!

               Freddy pokes his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's balls.

               Mr. Hilltop reacts accordingly.

                                     FREDDY
                         We are not aware of the impulses, 
                         neither do we intend them to contract 
                         our muscles. Yet -- as you can see -- 
                         they work by themselves.

               By this time, Mr. Hilltop has lowered his protective thigh... 
               a little nervously.

                                     FREDDY
                         Now then! Modern research has shown 
                         us that by simply applying local 
                         pressure of 'blocking' the nerve 
                         impulse... which can be done with 
                         any ordinary metal clamp...

               Freddy reaches out his hand. Carlson hands him a bicycle 
               clamp. Freddy holds Mr. Hilltop's head and places the clamp 
               behind Mr. Hilltop's ears.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...Just at the swelling on the 
                         posterior nerve root -- for, oh say 
                         five or six seconds...

               A short pause. Freddy looks at his watch.

                                     FREDDY
                         Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!

               Freddy once again jerks his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's balls.  
               This time Mr. Hilltop doesn't move. He is almost ready to 
               pass out.

                                     FREDDY
                         All communication is shut off.

               Similarly, damage to a nerve will mean that not all the 
               impulses can get through and there will be weakness of a 
               muscle...

               Mr. Hilltop collapses to the floor. Freddy never looks down.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...or group of muscles, with some 
                         loss of skin sensation on the area 
                         supplied by that nerve. In spite of 
                         our mechanical magnificence, if there 
                         is not this continuous stream of 
                         impulses... we would collapse like... 
                         a bunch of broccoli.

               A smattering of POLITE APPLAUSE. Freddy reaches down and 
               removes the metal clamp from Mr. Hilltop's head.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Carlson)
                         Give him an extra dollar.

                                     CARLSON
                         Yes, sir.

               Carlson picks up Mr. Hilltop and places him on the operating 
               table.

                                     FREDDY
                         In conclusion... it should be noted 
                         that more than common injury to the 
                         nerve roots is always serious, 
                         because... once a nerve fiber is 
                         severed... there is no way to 
                         regenerate life back into it. Are 
                         there any more questions before we 
                         leave?

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Dr. Fronkonsteen!

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes?

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Isn't it true that Darwin preserved 
                         a piece of vermicelli in a glass 
                         case until, by some extraordinary 
                         means, it actually began to move 
                         with voluntary motion?

                                     FREDDY
                         A piece of what?

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Vermicelli.

                                     FREDDY
                         Are you speaking of the worm, or... 
                         the spaghetti.

                                     FREDDY
                         Why the worm, Sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Ah! In science you must be very 
                         precise -- it can spell the difference 
                         between life and death.
                              (to Carlson)
                         I don't want that fellow in class 
                         next semester.

                                     CARLSON
                         Yes, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         He has a big mouth.
                              (to Medical Student)
                         Yes! It seems to me I did read 
                         something about that incident as a 
                         student. But you have to remember 
                         that a worm -- with very few 
                         exceptions -- is not a human being.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But wasn't that the whole basis of 
                         your grandfathers work, sir...? the 
                         re-animation of component parts?

                                     FREDDY
                         My father was a sick man.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But aren't you the least bit curious 
                         about it, Doctor? Doesn't the secret 
                         of life hold any intrigue for you?

                                     FREDDY
                         You are talking about the gibberish 
                         ravings of a lunatic mind.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Yes, but, sir... if it could be 
                         accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate 
                         disease from the human frame and 
                         render man invulnerable to any but a 
                         violent death?

                                     FREDDY
                         How old are you, young man?

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         Nineteen, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Nineteen! My dear young man... once 
                         the human organism has ceased to 
                         function, nature has deemed that 
                         creature to be dead.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But look at what's been done with 
                         hearts and kidneys!

                                     FREDDY
                         Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! 
                         I'm talking about the Central Nervous 
                         System.

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But, sir...

                                     FREDDY
                         I am a scientist...! Not a 
                         philosopher.

               He holds up his scalpel.

                                     FREDDY
                         You have more chance of re-animating 
                         this knife than you have of mending 
                         a broken nervous system,

                                     MEDICAL STUDENT
                         But your grandfather's work, sir...

                                     FREDDY
                         My grandfather's work was Doo-Doo! 
                         Dead is Dead! There's only one thing 
                         I am interested in... and that is 
                         the preservation of LIFE!

               POLITE APPLAUSE. However, on the word "Life," Freddy has 
               plunged the scalpel into his thigh by mistake. No one but 
               Freddy and the Movie Audience is aware of this.

                                     FREDDY
                         Class... is... dismissed!

               The students begin to leave.

                                     FREDDY
                         Carlson!

                                     CARLSON
                         Yes, sir?

                                     FREDDY
                         Bring me some surgical gauze, a little 
                         tape and some disinfectant.

                                     CARLSON
                         Yes, sir. Do you want the other 
                         cauliflower?

                                     FREDDY
                         ...No!

               Herr Falkstein approaches with the metal box.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Dr. Frankenstein?

                                     FREDDY
                              (through his teeth)
                         Fron kon steen!

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         My name is Gerhart Falkstein.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY

               Herr Falkstein and Freddy are walking along the sidewalk.

               In the distance, a little OLD VIOLINIST, wearing a Tyrolean 
               hat, plays a cheerful tune on his violin. His open violin 
               case rests on the ground beside him.

                                     FREDDY
                         One hundred thousand dollars???

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Oh, at least, sir. The land alone is 
                         worth a small fortune.

                                     FREDDY
                         But I can't just drop everything and 
                         leave. I have responsibilities and 
                         obligations.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Do you have a hundred thousand of 
                         them, sir?

               Freddy looks at Herr Falkstein. The little Old Violinist has 
               finished his cheerful tune. He now plays the eerie 
               Transylvanian Lullaby that was heard at the opening.

                                     FREDDY
                         How long will this whole thing take?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         A week. Ten days at most.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'll have to think it over. It's not 
                         so easy just to pick up and...

               Freddy stops -- the music seeping into a dark and forgotten 
               corner of his brain.

                                     FREDDY
                         Curious melody! Haunting, isn't it?

               Freddy, followed by Herr Falkstein, walks back a few steps 
               and stands next to the Old Violinist as he plays.

                                     FREDDY
                         What's that tune that you're playing

                                     OLD VIOLINIST
                         Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.

                                     FREDDY
                         How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.

               Freddy rubs his temples with his fingertips for a moment.

                                     FREDDY
                         May I see your violin?

                                     OLD VIOLINIST
                              (handing Freddy the 
                              violin)
                         It's an honor for me, sir. You play 
                         the violin?

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh, just a little.

               Freddy examines the violin.

                                     FREDDY
                         Nice! Nice little balance to it.

                                     OLD VIOLINIST
                         Ja, ja.

               Freddy, without any emotion, smashes the violin over his 
               knee and then hands the two halves back to the Old Violinist.

                                     FREDDY
                         Thank you very much.

               The Old Violinist takes the two halves, open-mouthed.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Herr Falkstein)
                         Well... if you're sure that I could 
                         accomplish everything in a week... I 
                         suppose I could manage it.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Why did you do that?

                                     FREDDY
                         What?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Break that old man's violin.

                                     FREDDY
                         I didn't do that.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         The old violinist -- you smashed his 
                         violin over your knee.

                                     FREDDY
                         I did not do that. Why would I do a 
                         thing like that...? Are you insane?

               It reads:

               BACK TO THE SCENE

               Now Freddy and Herr Falkstein are standing on a corner.

                                     FREDDY
                         All right then, I suppose I owe the 
                         family that much. You'll have 
                         everything ready for me when I arrive?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Yes, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         One week at the most!?

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         One week -- I'll see to it, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well, thank you very much for all 
                         your trouble.

               They shake hands.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Not at all -- a great privilege, 
                         Doctor.

                                     FREDDY
                         Saturday night then! I'll take the 
                         train to New York and fly from there.

                                     HERR FALKSTEIN
                         Saturday night, yes, sir. Have a 
                         pleasant journey!

               Freddy walks off. Herr Falkstein looks back at the little 
               Old Violinist, who is playing the TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY on 
               the top half of his violin.

               Freddy, with a large suitcase and a small briefcase, stands 
               next to a lot of steam... behind which, there appears to be 
               a waiting train. With Freddy is his beautiful, flat-chested 
               fiancee, ELIZABETH.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Darling!... you will be careful!?

                         Of course.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You have your tickets?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         And your passport?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, don't worry.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Call me from New York before you 
                         leave??

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Promise??

                                     FREDDY
                         I promise.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours 
                         that you're away.

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh, darling -- so will I.

                         I'd better leave.

               They look at each other; then kiss.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Will you miss me?

                                     FREDDY
                         Very.... very!

                         Oh, nice.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I hope you like large weddings.

                                     FREDDY
                         Whatever makes you happy.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I've trimmed the list to only our 
                         very closest friends... but it still 
                         comes to three thousand.

                                     FREDDY
                         You're incorrigible!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Does that mean you love me?

                                     FREDDY
                         You bet your boots it does.

                         Hurry now -- before I make a fool of 
                         myself.

               They kiss quickly.

                                     FREDDY
                         Goodbye, darling.

               Freddy DISAPPEARS into the steam.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Goodbye, Freddy! Hurry back to me!

                         Goodbye, darling.

               A long pause, as Elizabeth gazes into the mass of steam.

               She wipes a tear from her eye.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (whispering to herself)
                         Goodbye, darling.

                         Well, they were wrong then, weren't 
                         they?

                                     FREDDY
                         You were sent by Herr Falkstein, 
                         weren't you?

                                     IGOR
                         Yes, that's right. My grandfather 
                         and your grandfather used to pal 
                         around together. You and I should 
                         have a lot of laughs.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sure we will.

                                     IGOR
                              (indicating the large-
                              breasted woman behind 
                              him)
                         This is Inga. They thought you might 
                         need an assistant temporarily.

                                     FREDDY
                         How do you do?

                                     INGA
                         Extremely well.

                                     FREDDY
                         How nice.

                                     IGOR
                         Are these your bags?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, just the two.

               Igor takes the small briefcase and walks OFF. Freddy takes 
               the large suitcase and follows with Inga.

                                     INGA
                         Did you have a pleasant trip?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, thank you. It wasn't bad.

               They follow Igor past two men -- Dracula and Wolfman -- who 
               are sitting quietly on a platform bench. One of the men wears 
               a huge black cape and has two enormous eye teeth.

               The other man's face and hands are covered with wolf's hair.

                                     IGOR
                              (singing to himself)
                         Sun -- rise... Sun -- set! Dee -- 
                         dum... Dee -- dum.

               Freddy, struggling with his suitcase, stares in polite horror 
               at the two men as he and Inga walk past them.

                                     FREDDY
                         Good evening.

                                     DRACULA
                         Good evening.

                                     WOLFMAN
                         Good evening.

               Freddy and Inga continue on, walking under a dangling sign:

                                  "TRANSYLVANIA STATION"

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

               A cart, drawn by two horses, travels up a lonely road.

               Igor is at the reins. In the back, sitting in mountains of 
               hay, are Freddy and Inga.

                                     INGA
                         Did you ever have a roll in the hay?

                                     FREDDY
                              (a little nervous)
                         I'm not sure I... get your drift.

               Inga begins to roll herself over and over in the hay.

                                     INGA
                         You should try it -- it's fun.

               Somewhat embarrassed, Freddy leans over to speak to Igor.

                                     FREDDY
                         Incidentally -- I don't mean to 
                         embarrass you in any way, but I'm a 
                         rather brilliant surgeon. Perhaps I 
                         can help you with that hump.

                                     IGOR
                         What hump?

               Freddy tries to recover.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well... perhaps we can talk about it 
                         later.

               He turns back to Inga for relief. Just then: a BOLT OF 
               LIGHTNING! Inga comes close to Freddy.

                                     INGA
                         Sometimes I'm afraid of the lightning.

                                     FREDDY
                         Just an atmospheric discharge. Nothing 
                         to be afraid of.

               A HORRIFYING CRY OF A WOLF!

                                     FREDDY
                              (making a joke)
                         Werewolf.

                                     IGOR
                         There.

                                     FREDDY
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     IGOR
                              (pointing to the woods)
                         There wolf!
                              (pointing up the road)
                         There castle!

                                     FREDDY
                         Why are you talking like that?

                                     IGOR
                         I thought you wanted to.

                                     FREDDY
                         No.

                                     IGOR
                         Suit yourself... I'm easy.
                              (confidentially, 
                              indicating Inga)
                         Better watch out for the wockers.

                                     FREDDY
                         What wockers?

                                     IGOR
                         The wockers with the knockers.

                                     FREDDY
                         Wockers with the knockers???

                                     IGOR
                         Go ahead, play dumb! You'll lose 
                         your sockers and then be fockers.

               A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

                                     IGOR
                              (pointing to the top 
                              of the hill)
                         Well, there it is...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               illuminated by the lightning.

                                     IGOR
                              (o.s., as we see the 
                              castle)
                         Home!

                                     FREDDY
                              (to himself)
                         Home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE CASTLE

               As they approach the gigantic front door, FRAU BLUCHER opens 
               a smaller door, within the giant door, and stands on the 
               front stairs to greet them. She holds a lit candelabra.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Welcome! I am Frau Blucher.

               At the sound of her name, the HORSES REAR.

                                     IGOR
                         Down! Down! Steady!!

               Freddy takes his suitcase and helps Inga out of the cart.

               He approaches Frau Blucher.

                                     FREDDY
                         How do you do? I am Dr. Fronkonsteen.

               This is my assistant. Inga -- may I present Frau Blucher.

               The HORSES REAR.

                                     IGOR
                         Down! Get down, you beasts!

                                     FREDDY
                         I wonder what's got into them?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Your rooms are ready, Herr Doctor. 
                         If you will follow me, please.

               She indicates the small door.

                                     FREDDY
                              (calling to Igor)
                         Aye-gor! We'll wait for you inside. 
                         Hurry, please!

               He turns to the door.

                                     FREDDY
                         After you Frau Blucher.

               The HORSES REAR. Freddy, Inga and Frau Blucher have 
               disappeared through the small door. Igor struggles with the 
               rearing horses.

                                     IGOR
                         Easy. Easy! What's very sticky and 
                         rhymes with shoe?

               The horses calm down.

                                     IGOR
                         That's better.

               Igor takes Freddy's briefcase and heads for the door.

                                     IGOR
                              (to the horses)
                         I'll be back shortly. Just think of 
                         model airplanes.

               Igor shuns the smaller door and pulls the handle that opens 
               the giant door. He walks into the castle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RECEPTION HALL

               Frau Blucher is waiting on a large staircase with Freddy and 
               Inga. Igor comes up to them.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Shall we proceed?

               They all follow in the aura of Frau Blucher's candlelight.

               From outside there is a: LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER. When they 
               reach the top of the stairs, Frau Blucher starts down a 
               corridor. Igor walks up to a light switch and tries it.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as ALL THE LIGHTS COME ON. Igor turns the lights off again, 
               gesturing to Freddy not to say anything because Frau Blucher 
               might be a little bonkers. Inga, Freddy and Igor turn into 
               the corridor and disappear.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FREDDY'S BEDROOM

               A fire is going in the fire place. Candles are lit in wall 
               sconces. One wall is devoted to books.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         I hope you find this comfortable. 
                         This was Baron Victor's room.

                                     FREDDY
                         It seems fine.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         You'll fine the keys to all the rooms 
                         in my cas... all the rooms in your 
                         castle on this ring. I'll leave it 
                         on the table here.

                                     FREDDY
                         Does that include the key to the 
                         laboratory?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         You mean... the laboratory??

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes!... the laboratory.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept 
                         that separate.

                                     FREDDY
                         May I have it, please?

               A pregnant pause.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Of course.

               She pulls up on a chain around her neck. At the end of the 
               chain is a key that had been resting against her bosom.

               She takes it off, kisses it quickly, and sets it on the table.

                                     FREDDY
                              (examining the bookcase)
                         There seem to be quite a few books.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's 
                         medical library.

                                     FREDDY
                         I see. And where is my grandfather's 
                         private library?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         I don't know what you mean, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well, there was a public and a private 
                         library -- he said so in his will. 
                         These books are all very general -- 
                         any doctor might have them in his 
                         study.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         This is the only library I know of.

                                     FREDDY
                         Surely he kept his notes -- his 
                         private papers and records in some 
                         other place?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         I think you must be mistaken, sir.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well... we'll see.

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         Will there be anything else?

                                     FREDDY
                         I don't think so. Is my assistant 
                         taken care of?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         I put her in the guest room, just 
                         down the hall.

                                     FREDDY
                         Good.

               She leaves. Freddy starts back towards the bookcase and pulls 
               book.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Door opens and Inga enters.

                                     INGA
                         Are you busy?

                                     FREDDY
                         That's quite all right. What is it, 
                         dear?

                                     INGA
                         Could I lie down in your bed for a 
                         little while? I just can't sleep.

                                     FREDDY
                         We only arrived a few minutes ago.

                                     INGA
                         I know, but usually I can fall asleep 
                         right away. It must be the strange 
                         room.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well...

                                     INGA
                         Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. 
                         Then you can force me right back to 
                         my room.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well.. I suppose it would be all 
                         right, for just a little while.

               Inga gets into Freddy's bed.

                                     FREDDY
                         Would you like a sandwich?

                                     INGA
                         No, thanks! I want to get right to 
                         sleep.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well... I'll just finish unpacking.

               As Freddy continues to unpack, he hears a STRANGE "BLOWING" 
               SOUND coming from outside. He goes to the window and looks 
               up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A TURRET AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE

               Igor sits in the window, trying to blow a ram's horn. He 
               tries and tries, but can't get one good sustained not.

               Finally, he throws the ram's horns away and picks up a 
               trumpet. He blows some "SWEET" BLUES.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FREDDY

               lying in a chaise lounge near the bed, reading. He wears his 
               robe over his clothes. Freddy looks at Inga, who is sound 
               asleep. Now he drains the last of his glass of fruit juice 
               and sets it down on an end table. He turns over to sleep. 
               The CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN SLOWLY to the bedroom window. On 
               its way, we SEE: A FEW DROPS OF FRUIT JUICE dripping down 
               the inside of the glass that Freddy has just put down.

               ANGLE THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW (STOCK FOOTAGE)

               CLOUDS PASS ACROSS A FULL MOON.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               LATER THAT NIGHT

               Deadly silence! As the CAMERA PANS from the clouds, SLOWLY 
               BACK ACROSS THE ROOM, suddenly -- from the deep recesses or 
               the castle -- A VIOLIN IS HEARD PLAYING: THE EERIE 
               TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY. As the CAMERA reaches Freddy, he is 
               tossing restlessly in his sleep.

                                     FREDDY
                         Stop it. Stop it, I tell you I don't 
                         want to be perfect. Can't you 
                         understand that? I don't want to be 
                         perfect!

               Freddy wakes with a start. He sits up and listens to the 
               MUSIC. Then he stands and crosses to the bed.

                                     FREDDY
                         Inga!

                                     INGA
                              (in her sleep)
                         Yes, you may... but don't make any 
                         noise.

                                     FREDDY
                              (shaking her)
                         Inga, wake up!

                                     INGA
                              (slowly waking)
                         What is it? Is something wrong, 
                         Doctor?

                                     FREDDY
                         Listen! Don't you hear that strange 
                         music?

                                     INGA
                              (listening)
                         Yes! What could it be at this hour?

                                     FREDDY
                         I don't know. It just woke me up.

               Freddy goes to the bookcase; Inga follows.

                                     FREDDY
                         It seem to be coming from behind 
                         this bookcase.

               He puts his ear against the books and then feels for some 
               hidden button or handle.

                                     FREDDY
                         Hand me one of those candles!

               Inga takes a candle from a wall sconce and hands it to Freddy.  
               He looks closely at the books, examining some of the titles.  
               One title reads:

               INSERT - TITLE

                          "SEX AND HAIR GROWTH: IT'S UP TO YOU"

               FREDDY

               out of amazement, pulls the book from the shelf.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               A small door opens in the bookcase.

                                     INGA
                         Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!

                                     FREDDY
                              (listening through 
                              the open door)
                         Whatever it is, it's coming from 
                         down there. I'm going down to see.

                                     INGA
                         Let me come with you, Doctor, please! 
                         I don't want to stay up here alone.

                                     FREDDY
                         All right then, quietly! Close your 
                         robe and stay right behind me. Don't 
                         make a sound!

               They enter the secret passage.

               INT. SECRET PASSAGE

               Freddy, holding the candle above them, follows the MUSIC 
               down a narrow, winding stairway. The source of the MUSIC 
               gets CLOSER and CLOSER, as they follow the yellow candlelight 
               down, down, down... brushing against the cobwebbed walls. As 
               they pass one section of wall, an ancient sign can just barely 
               be made out in the after glow of their light. It reads:

                            CAPACITY: NOT MORE THAN 3 PERSONS
                                       BY ORDER OF:
                                        FIRE DEPT.

               Finally, they reach a landing. A door separates them from 
               whatever lies beyond. Freddy takes hold of the handle... it 
               crumbles in his hand like dust. He gently pushes against the 
               door. It CREAKS slowly open. The VIOLIN MUSIC STOPS!

               INT. VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN'S LABORATORY

               Freddy and Inga walk into the now famous room. A strange 
               light comes from around a corner. As they walk towards the 
               light, they pass a shelf lined with skulls. They look at 
               each ancient head as they pass. Inga shudder with horror.

               The forth head is Igor. It looks as if his head is on the 
               shelf, but actually he is standing just behind the shelf.  
               He smiles.

                                     FREDDY
                         Aye-gor!

                                     IGOR
                         Fro-derick!

                                     FREDDY
                         What are you doing here?

                                     IGOR
                         I got frightened all alone upstairs, 
                         so I came down here.

               He leads them around the corner, where a glass bowl filled 
               with water is being heated by small flame.

                                     FREDDY
                         But what you were doing?

                                     IGOR
                         Just putting up some tea.

                                     FREDDY
                         Did you hear that strange music?

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         Did you hear that strange music??

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         Did you hear that strange music?

                                     IGOR
                         No, not sound.

                                     INGA
                         There must have been someone else 
                         down here then.

                                     FREDDY
                         It seems that way.
                              (to Igor)
                         You didn't hear any music at all?

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't 
                         there any lights in this place?

                                     IGOR
                         Two switches over there, but I wasn't 
                         going to be the first.

               Freddy walks over and throws the first switch. OPEN ENDED 
               ELECTRICAL CURRENTS SHOOT OUT ALL OVER.

                                     IGOR
                         Well, it's all right for atmosphere.

               Freddy turns off the first switch and then throws the other 
               one.

               "NORMAL" LIGHTS GO ON

               Now the lab can be SEEN in all its old splendor, but thick 
               in dust and spiders' webs.

                                     INGA
                         Ooh!

                                     FREDDY
                         What a filthy mess.

                                     IGOR
                         I don't know... a little paint, some 
                         flowers...

                                     FREDDY
                         Did you see anyone else down here?

                                     IGOR
                         No, but when I first came in, there 
                         was a light coming from behind that 
                         steel door.

               A huge steel door is open a few inches. Freddy goes to the 
               door and listens, then opens it and they all walk in... 
               hesitantly.

               INT. PRIVATE LIBRARY

               By the light of Freddy's candle, they see a small, creepy 
               room, filled with musty books. There is a table in the center 
               of the floor. On the table there is a large book, an ashtray, 
               and a VIOLIN AND BOW.

                                     INGA
                              (seeing the violin)
                         Look, Doctor!

                                     FREDDY
                         Well, this explains the music.

                                     INGA
                         But who was playing it?

               There is a smoldering cigar in the ashtray.

                                     FREDDY
                         I don't know, but whoever it was 
                         barely finished putting out his cigar.  
                         It's still smoldering.
                              (to Igor)
                         Let me smell your breath.

               Igor exhales in Freddy's face. Freddy nearly passes out.

                                     FREDDY
                         Well, it wasn't you.

               He looks around the room.

                                     FREDDY
                         What is this place?

                                     IGOR
                         Must be the music room.

                                     INGA
                         There's nothing but books and papers.

                                     FREDDY
                         I wonder...

               He looks at the large book lying on the table. He puts his 
               candle over the cover. A LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER as we SEE:

               CLOSE SHOT - BOOK

                          "HOW I DID IT" BY VICTOR FRANKENSTEIN.

               Camera pulls back.

                                     FREDDY
                         It is! This was my grandfather's 
                         private library. Look at this!

                                     IGOR
                              (reading the cover of 
                              the book)
                         'How I Did It.' Good title!

                                     FREDDY
                         Funny it should just be lying out 
                         here on the table. I wonder what 
                         kind of dribble this is?

               He opens to the first page.

                                     FREDDY
                              (reading aloud)
                         'Whence, I often asked myself, did 
                         the principles of life proceed? To 
                         examine the causes of life... we 
                         must first have recourse to death.' 
                         God, what a looney bin!

               ANOTHER LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Freddy's candle almost blows 
               out from a draft.

                                     INGA
                         Oh, doctor!

                                     FREDDY
                         Perhaps we'd better leave.

                                     IGOR
                         Taking the book along?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, I think we could all use a good 
                         laugh.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LAB

               Freddy is convulsed with laughter.

                                     FREDDY
                         This guy is too much.

               Inga and Igor stare passively. The three of them are drinking 
               tea. More water is boiling in a test tube.

                                     FREDDY
                              (reading)
                         '...and as soon as the dazzling light 
                         vanished, the oak tree had 
                         disappeared. I knew then that 
                         electricity and galvanism had changed 
                         my life.'

               He howls.

                                     FREDDY
                         This guy is bonkers! Did you ever 
                         hear anything like this??

               ANOTHER LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER.

               As Freddy goes on reading, the CAMERA TRAVELS UP, UP, UP...

               THROUGH the giant laboratory... as if to seek the source of 
               the THUNDER we HEAR, as the CAMERA MOVES UP:

                                     FREDDY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         'When I look back now, it seems to 
                         me as if this almost miraculous event 
                         obliterated any last effort by the 
                         spirit of preservation to avert the 
                         storm that was even then hanging in 
                         the stars.'

               MORE THUNDER.

                                     FREDDY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         He kills me! This guy kills me.

               The CAMERA FINDS a large opening in the ceiling -- an opening 
               through which bodies might be elevated during an electrical 
               storm. THUNDER CLOUDS CAN BE SEEN as the CAMERA PASSES THROUGH 
               the opening into the night air.

               FREDDY'S LAUGHTER is still HEARD from below. There is a GIANT 
               CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING -- as if in reply.

               Now the CAMERA TRAVELS DOWN. Time has passes and Freddy's 
               voice is hoarse, and more intense, and as the CAMERA TRAVELS 
               DOWN:

                                     FREDDY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         'Until, from the midst of this 
                         darkness, a sudden light broke in 
                         upon me -- a light so brilliant and 
                         wondrous, and yet so simple!'

               The CAMERA has reached Freddy. His eyes are burning; he reads 
               almost feverishly. Inga and Igor are half asleep.

                                     FREDDY
                              (reading)
                         'Change the poles from plus to minus 
                         and from minus to plus!'

               Freddy howls insanely.

                                     FREDDY
                              (reading)
                         'I alone succeeded in discovering 
                         the cause of generation of life.'

               He doubles over in laughter.

                                     FREDDY
                         'Nay, even more -- I, myself became 
                         capable of bestowing animation upon 
                         lifeless matter.'

               He laughs, he laughs, he laughs... then SMASHES his tea glass 
               against a wall.

                                     FREDDY
                         It could work!!

               A TUMULTUOUS CLAP OF THUNDER.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               IGOR'S FACE

               Illuminated by a CRACK OF LIGHTNING. He has a quizzical smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INGA'S FACE

               Illuminated by a CRACK OF LIGHTNING. Frightened, yet in awe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FRAU BLUCHER'S FACE - IN A ROOM

               Illuminated by a CRACK OF LIGHTNING. She is SMOKING A CIGAR.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN'S COFFIN

               Illuminated by a CRACK OF LIGHTNING. THE LID SLAMS OPEN AND 
               SHUT, OPEN AND SHUT.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FREDDY'S FACE

               Illuminated by a CRACK OF LIGHTNING. The dark circles under 
               his eyes suggest that he is IRREVERSIBLY INSANE.

               LEGEND

               It reads:

                           "IRREVERSIBLY COMMITTED TO THE DARK
                 DESTINY OF ALL THOSE WHO BEAR THE NAME OF 'FRANKENSTEIN'
                                     'FRONKONSTEEN.'"

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. LABORATORY - MORNING

               A work space has been hastily prepared. Freddy, dressed quite 
               properly in riding boots and tweed jacket, is reading from 
               "the great book".

               Inga, dressed in her Lab gown, is taking notes. Igor is 
               drawing on a large pad.

                                     FREDDY
                         'As the minuteness of the parts formed 
                         a great hindrance to my speed, I 
                         resolved to make the Creature of a 
                         gigantic stature.' Of course! That 
                         would simplify everything.

                                     INGA
                              (pointing to another 
                              paragraph)
                         And look at this, Doctor!

                                     FREDDY
                              (reading)
                         'Dilation of his sacral 
                         parasympathetic impulses would cause

                         erection to approximately nineteen 
                         inches of his apparatus genitals.'

                                     IGOR
                         His what??

                                     INGA
                         His schwanzstucker.

                         Whew! A nineteen-inch drill.

                                     FREDDY
                         Now then! What we're aiming for, is 
                         a being about eight feet in height, 
                         and all features proportionably large.

               Igor shows his drawing.

                                     IGOR
                         Something like this?

               They all look at the drawing.

               They, and we, SEE a crude but impressive sketch of THE 
               MONSTER, and as we look at the drawing:

                                     FREDDY'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         You've caught something there. Yes!  
                         As a matter of fact -- I think -- 
                         that this -- might -- be -- our -- 
                         man!

               As our eyes travel from the top of the drawing to the feet:

                                                         MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

               A PAIR OF VERY LARGE, REAL FEET

               Now the CAMERA MOVES from the feet, BACK UP.

               EXT. GIBBET - DAY

               A gigantic BODY is standing on a scaffold. When we reach the 
               head, it is somehow incongruous: A sweet, boyish face -- 
               with a rope around its neck.

               The "Body" is about to be hanged. Next to it stands an 
               EXECUTIONER.

                                     EXECUTIONER
                         Have anything to say?

                                     THE BODY
                              (in quiet anger)
                         MMmmmgrrrrrrrrr!

                                     EXECUTIONER
                         Anything else?

               The "Body" thinks. Then:

                                     THE BODY
                         Go shove it up your --

               The Executioner throws the lever and THE TRAP DOOR FALLS 
               OPEN.

               The "Body" hangs, lifeless.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               LEAVES BLOW ACROSS A COLD CEMETERY.

               A coffin is carried by FOUR PALLBEARERS to a deep grave.

               RELATIVES are waiting by the grave site.

               Through an iron gate surrounding the cemetery, TWO DARK 
               FIGURES peek through the rails and observe the funeral.

               One of them has a hunched back.

               SOFT MOANING is HEARD from one of the Relatives. A MINISTER 
               mumbles Latin under his breath.

               The Pallbearers set the coffin down on ropes placed over the 
               gravesite. A short distance away are a FATHER and a MOTHER, 
               standing next to a weeping DAUGHTER.

                                     FATHER
                         He was a good man.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was an angel.

                                     FATHER
                         He was a saint!

               A pause.

                                     MOTHER
                         She had to marry this rotten pig 
                         instead.

                                     FATHER
                         Hanging was too good -- they should 
                         have soaked him in lye.

               The minister nods and TWO GRAVE DIGGERS lower the coffin.

               The Daughter throws a bouquet of flowers onto the descending 
               coffin. The Minister throws a handful on dirt on top of the 
               coffin -- representing "Ashes to Ashes."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE COFFIN

               We SEE the FROZEN FACE of "The Body," and HEAR the sprinkled 
               dirt as it HITS the coffin lid.

               A little dirt seeps in through the lid and lands on the lips 
               of the frozen face.

               Ever so subtly, the lips make a spitting motion to clear the 
               dirt away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GRAVEYARD

               The Grave Diggers are shoveling dirt into the grave. The 
               Relatives and Minister are leaving.

                                     FIRST GRAVE DIGGER
                         What a filthy job!

                                     SECOND GRAVE DIGGER
                         Could be worse!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FREDDY AND IGOR

               Knee-deep in the grave, shoveling the dirt out.

                                     FREDDY
                         What a filthy job!

                                     IGOR
                         Could be worse!

                                     FREDDY
                         How?

                                     IGOR
                         Could be raining!

               A CRACK OF THUNDER.

               Freddy stares at Igor.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A STREET

               Freddy and Igor carry the coffin down a street in the POURING 
               RAIN.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LABORATORY

               Freddy and Igor are just setting the heavy coffin down on an 
               operating table. They take the lid off the hinges and set it 
               aside.

                                     FREDDY
                         Wait! Let's tip the coffin over, 
                         then just lift it off. It'll be much 
                         easier.

               They tip the coffin over, upside down, like a cake pan.

                                     FREDDY
                         Now...

               They lift the coffin up... but the operating table remains 
               empty.

                                     FREDDY
                         Set it down!

               They set it down on the table again. Freddy gives the bottom 
               of the coffin (which is now on top), a big WHACK!

               They lift the coffin up again and there is the "Body."

               It had been struck.

                                     FREDDY
                              (looking at the "Body")
                         Magnificent!

               He checks its nails.

                                     FREDDY
                         Very little decay. With this 
                         magnificent specimen for a body, all 
                         we need now is an equally magnificent 
                         brain.
                              (he looks at Igor)
                         You know what to do!

                                     IGOR
                         I have a pretty good idea.

               Igor glances at the movie audience for a moment.

                                     FREDDY
                         Do you have the name I wrote down?

                                     IGOR
                              (looking at his sleeve)
                         Yes. Dr. H. Delbruck.

                                     FREDDY
                         I want that brain.

                                     IGOR
                         Was he any good?

                                     FREDDY
                         Was he any good??? He was the finest 
                         natural philosopher, internal medicine 
                         diagnostician and chemical therapist 
                         of this century.

                                     IGOR
                         Hmm!

                                     FREDDY
                         And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.

                                     IGOR
                         That's not bad.

                                     FREDDY
                         Can you imagine that brain in this 
                         body?

                                     IGOR
                         I'm getting excited just thinking 
                         about it. What if he's not there?

                                     FREDDY
                         He only died two weeks ago -- I'm 
                         sure they'll still have him. Hurry 
                         now. I'll prepare the body.

                                     IGOR
                              (starting to leave)
                         Oh! May I call you 'Master'?

                                     FREDDY
                         Why?

                                     IGOR
                         It's always been one of my favorite 
                         names.

                                     FREDDY
                         If you like -- just hurry!

                                     IGOR
                         Thank you, Master.

               Freddy rolls up the "Body's" right sleeve. He gazes at the 
               immensity of the hand in amazement and awe.

                                     FREDDY
                         Look at this hand! Look at these 
                         fingers!

               A sudden thought twists through his brain. He sets the dead 
               arm up on its elbow, intertwines his own right hand with 
               that of the "Body's," and gets set for an "Indian Arm 
               Wrestle."

               Freddy forces the dead arm down -- not without some difficulty -- 
               and then gives the "Body" a triumphant sneer.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A HOSPITAL DOOR

               The upper half of the door is made of glass. On the glass is 
               printed:

                             B R A I N   D E P O S I T A R Y
                     AFTER 5:00 P.M. SHOVE BRAIN THROUGH SLOT IN DOOR

               The SHADOW OF A MAN can be SEEN silhouetted from inside the 
               Depository. The Man has a large hump on his back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DEPOSITORY - NIGHT

               LOW THUNDER!

               A row of brains in jars, under glass domes, rests on a long, 
               narrow table.

               Igor tiptoes slowly, examining the labels on each glass dome 
               that he passes.

               ALBERTUS MAGNUS

               CORNELIUS AGRIPPA

               LAWRENCE TALBOT 
               (Physicist) 
               (Natural Philosopher) 
               (Hematologist)

               Then he comes to:

               HANS DELBRUCK 
               (Scientist & Saint)

               Igor approaches the glass dome, lifts it off, and takes the 
               jar containing the brain of Hans Delbruck.

               As he turns to go, he sees himself in a Full-length mirror.

               He drops the jar in fright.

               He looks down and sees the gooks mass of brain and glass.

               He looks at the Movie Audience.

                                     IGOR
                         Funny thing is... I tried!

               He sweeps some of the mess under the table with his foot.

                                     IGOR
                              (muttering to himself)
                         Freud would have a heyday with this.  
                         Well...

               He looks quickly at the "Brain table," grabs a jar from under 
               the glass dome nearest to him, and leaves.

               On the glass dome, whose contents Igor has just taken, is 
               printed:

                                  DO NOT USE THIS BRAIN!

                                        "ABNORMAL"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SKY

               An ominous BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

               THE FACE OF THE "BODY"

               He has a few cute stitch marks. Electrodes stick out from 
               both sides of his neck.

               INT. LABORATORY

               Freddy, wearing a long, white surgeon's gown and surgical 
               mask, stands over the "Body," which is strapped across the 
               chest and thighs. Freddy has a thimble on the finger of one 
               hand -- a needle and thread in the other.

                                     FREDDY
                         Finished!

               The "Body" is on an operating table, which is in the center 
               of a platform directly below the opening in the ceiling.

               Inga stands nearby.

                         What a beautiful job!

               Freddy looks up to the opening in the ceiling.

                              (shouting)
                         Ready?? 'Looking back now, it seems 
                         to me as if this almost miraculous 
                         event obliterated any last effort by 
                         the spirit of preservation to avert 
                         the storm that was even then hanging 
                         in the stars.'

               EXT. ROOF

               Igor stands on the roof, flying two kites in order to attract 
               the lightning bolts. He is wearing rubber boots, rubber 
               gloves, and a rubber whaler's coat and hat.

                         doing?

                         Yes! It's all written down in the 
                         notes. Tie off the kites and come 
                         down!

                         Yes, master. Just don't turn on any 
                         radios.

               INT. LABORATORY

               Freddy hands Inga the needle and thread. Then he grabs an 
               electrical plug, connected to a "battery indicator," and 
               plugs it into two small slits in one of the electrodes in 
               the "Body's" throat... as you would plug in a lamp. He reads 
               the indicator.

               A CRACK OF THUNDER!

               Igor comes down a small, spiral staircase from the roof.

                                     IGOR
                         You'd better hurry -- I think it's 
                         going to rain.

                         Raise the platform, hurry!

                                     INGA
                         Oh! Yes, Doctor.

               She turns a giant wheel on the wall. The platform rises 
               towards the opening in the ceiling, with Freddy and the "Body" 
               on it.

                                     FREDDY
                              (as he is going up)
                         The ancient masters promised 
                         impossibilities and performed nothing. 
                         We shall penetrate into the recesses 
                         of nature. We shall ascend into the 
                         Heavens. We shall command the thunders 
                         of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and 
                         even mock the invisible world with 
                         its own shadows.

                         Tonight?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes! When I give the word -- throw 
                         the first switch!

                                     IGOR
                         You've got it, master.

               The platform rises higher and higher. RAIN starts to come 
               down on Freddy.

                                     FREDDY
                         Get ready!

               The platform nears the opening.

                                     FREDDY
                         Get set!

               The platform rises through the opening and then stops. Now 
               Freddy is out in the open air, on the roof.

               EXT. ROOF

               A BOLT OF LIGHTNING and a CRACK OF THUNDER!

                                     FREDDY
                         Go!!

               INT. LABORATORY

               Igor throws the first switch.

               SPARKS, CURRENTS, DIALS capture our eyes.

               EXT. ROOF

               Freddy is getting drenched. He tries to check the "battery 
               indicator" plugged into the "Body."

                                     FREDDY
                              (shouting down)
                         Throw the second switch!

               INT. LABORATORY

                         This guy means business.

               Igor looks up in awe.

               EXT. ROOF

               MORE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.

                                     FREDDY
                         It's not enough. More! More, do you 
                         hear me?

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         More, do you hear me?

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         Throw the third switch!

                                     IGOR
                              (throwing the switch)
                         Wait till he sees the bill.

               INT. LABORATORY

               The Laboratory is an electrical circus.

               EXT. ROOF

                                     FREDDY
                         All right -- turn everything off and 
                         bring me down!

               INT. LABORATORY

               Inga turns the giant wheel the other way.

               Igor throws back the three switches.

               THE LIGHTS RETURN TO NORMAL.

               Inga and Igor watch Freddy and the platform descend.

               When it reaches the floor, Freddy stands soaked to the skin.

               ALL EYES ARE ON THE "BODY."

                                     FREDDY
                         Nothing!

               They all stare at:

               THE FROZEN FACE of the "Body."

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Freddy, Inga and Igor sit at a long dining room table, set 
               with food and wine. Freddy stares into space.

                         I thought it was wonderful.

                                     FREDDY
                         I don't understand -- I followed the 
                         notes to the letter.

                                     IGOR

                         But there must be a reason. This is 
                         science, not art.

                         Gewurzgurkensosse, please.

               Igor looks at Inga, then passes the meat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY

               The FROZEN FACE is still frozen. The chest is not breathing.

               The arm is motionless.

               The FINGERS... MOVE!

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

                         Let's look once more. I can't stand 
                         just sitting here doing nothing. 
                         Maybe we left to soon.

               Freddy and Igor set up. Inga goes on eating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE LABORATORY

               Freddy and Igor walk into the Laboratory and stand next to 
               the "Body."

                                     FREDDY
                         Cold! Cold and dead!

                                     IGOR
                         You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest 
                         wasn't built in a day.

               Freddy leans his head down, in anguish, and rests it on the 
               chest of the "Body."

               The "Body's" FINGER pushes against Freddy's behind. Igor 
               doesn't see it.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Igor)
                         Don't try to cheer me up that way.

                                     IGOR
                         Well, I don't like to see you mope.

               Igor stands next to Freddy.

                                     IGOR
                         You'll be getting me sad next.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm sorry. I don't mean to take out 
                         my frustration on you. You've been a 
                         great help to me, and I've let you 
                         down.

               The "Finger" rubs against Igor's behind.

                                     IGOR
                              (looking up suddenly)
                         I'm not that sort you know. I 
                         appreciate you feelings, but try to 
                         show them some other way.

                                     FREDDY
                              (lifting his head)
                         You're right! Self-pity never got 
                         anyone anywhere. Let's go back and 
                         finish our dinner.

               They leave.

               The "Finger" OPENS AND CLOSES ITS HAND.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DINING ROOM

               Inga, Igor and Freddy are eating dessert.

                                     IGOR
                         What is this?

                                     FREDDY
                         Schwartzwalder Kirschtorte.

               Seeping in from the laboratory, we HEAR: "MMMMMMmmmmmm!"

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Igor)
                         Oh, do you like it? I'm not partial 
                         to desserts, but this is excellent.

                                     IGOR
                         Who are you talking to?

                                     FREDDY
                         To you! You just made a 'yummy' sound, 
                         so I thought you liked the dessert.

                                     IGOR
                         I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I 
                         just asked what it was.

                                     FREDDY
                         But you did -- I just heard it.

                                     IGOR
                         It wasn't me.

               Freddy looks at Inga.

                                     INGA
                         It wasn't me.

                                     FREDDY
                         Look here -- if it wasn't you, and 
                         it wasn't you, and it wasn't me...

               Their eyeballs meet in the center of the room. Then they all 
               tear downstairs to the Laboratory.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY

               They burst into the room.  What we may at last call THE 
               MONSTER is straining, tentatively, against the straps across 
               his chest and thighs. His head is raised.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMMMMMMMMMMMNNNNNNmmmmmmmm?!?

                         It's alive!

                                     INGA
                         Oh, Doctor!

                         I think you've done it, master.

                                     FREDDY
                         Alive! Look at it. I have defeated 
                         death!

                                     IGOR
                         Better not get too close, master. 
                         This guy could kill you.

                                     FREDDY
                         I suppose you're right. Inga! Prepare 
                         a sedative, just in case.

               Inga goes to a medicine case and prepares a hypodermic.

               The Monster raises its head and makes little circles with 
               its hands, asking to be "free."

                                     FREDDY
                         It's trying to talk. It wants us to 
                         take off the straps.

                                     IGOR
                         Don't fall for that one.

                                     FREDDY
                         But don't you see... the brain of 
                         Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque 
                         hulk -- pleading with us. I've got 
                         to untie it.

                                     IGOR
                         Careful, master -- you never can 
                         tell with these chaps.

                                     FREDDY
                         All right... stand back!

               Freddy carefully walks up to the Monster and stands over 
               him. The monster is silent, feeling his way.

                                     FREDDY
                         Hello there.

                         I'm going to untie you -- can you 
                         understand that?

                              (a soft, "crying" 
                              sound)
                         MMMmmmm! MMMmmmm!

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, I'm going to set you free.
                              (to Inga)
                         Is the sedative ready?

                                     INGA
                         Yes, Doctor.

               Freddy takes the strap across the Monster's thighs and unties 
               it. Then he unties the strap across its chest... and steps 
               back. ALL EYES ARE ON THE MONSTER. TINGLY MUSIC. The Monster 
               looks at them all for a moment while he is still lying down. 
               A slightly sly grin comes to his mouth. He rises... slowly, 
               carefully, to a sitting position.

                                     MONSTER
                              (a low, suspicious 
                              groan)
                         MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm.

                                     FREDDY
                         It's alive. It's -- moving! It's -- 
                         breathing! It's -- standing! What is 
                         your name?

                                     MONSTER
                              (thinking for a moment)
                         ...It's.

                                     IGOR
                         Original.

                                     FREDDY
                              (holding out his hands)
                         Give -- me -- your -- hand!

               The Monster slowly extends his hands to Freddy. Freddy takes 
               them and leads the Monster into his first steps.

               PRODUCTION NUMBER - "ALIVE"

               ...in which Freddy, the Monster and Igor do a SONG and DANCE 
               that teaches the Monster how to move. Occasionally, Inga and 
               an unseen FIFTY-PIECE ORCHESTRA join in. The Monster tries, 
               in his own special way, to imitate the gentle, "Soft Shoe" 
               examples of Freddy and Igor. But where they "Ping" and 
               "Clink"... he "PONGS" and "CLONGS."

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               After a big finish, the Monster beams ecstatically. He bows 
               out of instinct: "Show Business" is in his blood.

                                     FREDDY
                         Whew! I'm glad that's over with.

                                     IGOR
                         You can say that again.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes.

                                     IGOR
                         You're just supposed to repeat what 
                         you said.

                                     FREDDY
                         Why?

                                     IGOR
                         What's the point of my setup? It's 
                         not funny unless you repeat exactly 
                         what you said.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm not trying to be funny.

               Igor looks at the Movie Audience.

                                     IGOR
                         Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful 
                         cue.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...I'm glad that's...

                                     IGOR
                         No, no! That whole thing!

                                     FREDDY
                         ...Whew! I'm glad that's over with.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMMmmmmmmmmm!

               They all look at the Monster.

                                     IGOR
                         See what I mean?

               Freddy gives Igor a dirty look.

                                     MONSTER
                              (signifying "More!")
                         MMMmmm! MMMmmm!

                                     INGA
                         I think 'It' wants to do it again 
                         Doctor.

                                     FREDDY
                         It looks that way.

                                     INGA
                         What do you think we should do?

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh... let's do it a little more.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               They all SING and DANCE a short encore of "ALIVE." The Monster 
               gets violently carried away in his search for dance 
               perfection.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Freddy, Igor and Inga drop from exhaustion after another, 
               even bigger ORCHESTRAL finish. The Monster immediately asks 
               for:

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmm!

               They all stare at him in horror.

                                     MONSTER
                              (signifying "More")
                         MMMMmmmmm! MMMMmmmmm!

               Freddy walks boldly up to the Monster.

                                     FREDDY
                         Stop that! Now just stop that this 
                         instant and listen to me!

               The Monster stares at Freddy in fascination.

                                     FREDDY
                         I have given you one of the finest 
                         minds of this century. You are a 
                         brilliant endocrinologist. You are a 
                         superb scientist. And you are making 
                         naughty! Now that's enough. Finished! 
                         From now on, you will behave like a 
                         man, and not a spoiled, snot-nosed, 
                         sniveling brat who thinks he can get 
                         anything he wants by bullying people 
                         with sheer brute force.

               The Monster gives Freddy a W H A C K you wouldn't believe 
               unless you were there. Inga SCREAMS.

                                     IGOR
                         This fellow's got great timing.

               The Monster picks Freddy up in his two hands and then holds 
               him high over his head.

                                     INGA
                         Oh, Doctor -- be careful!

               The Monster is about to dash Freddy to pieces, when:

               MUSIC: A VIOLIN is HEARD PLAYING the EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN 
               LULLABY. The monster FREEZES -- still holding Freddy over 
               his head.

                                     MONSTER
                              (soft, pathetic cries)
                         Mmmmmm! Mmmmmm!

                                     INGA
                         Doctor! There's that strange music 
                         again. What could it be?

                                     IGOR
                         It seem to have stopped the big fellow 
                         in his tracks.

                                     FREDDY
                              (from over the 
                              Monster's head)
                         Ayegor! Find out where that music is 
                         coming from as quietly and as 
                         blindingly fast as you can.

                                     IGOR
                         Yes, Master!

                                     FREDDY
                         Act casual!

               Igor casually takes out a box of jujubees from his pocket 
               and eats one. He walks over to the Monster, who is still 
               holding Freddy over his head.

                                     IGOR
                              (to the Monster)
                         Care for a jujubee?

               The Monster lowers one hand -- holding Freddy up with the 
               other -- and takes the box of jujubees. He sniffs them.

                                     FREDDY
                         Clever ploy!

               The Monster drains the box of jujubees in one gulp, then 
               hands the empty box back to Igor.

                                     IGOR
                              (looking at the empty 
                              box)
                         NO movies together for us -- that's 
                         for sure.

               Igor MOVES OFF in search of the MUSIC. The Monster -- deeply 
               affected by the LULLABY -- slowly sets Freddy down.

                                     INGA
                         It's almost as if he were afraid. He 
                         loves that music.

               The Monster begins to hug Freddy and snuggle him. He behaves 
               like a frightened, loving child, as he holds his arms out to 
               Freddy.

                                     INGA
                         I think he wants you to carry him, 
                         Doctor.

               Freddy nods agreement.

                                     INGA
                         What are you going to do?

                                     FREDDY
                         I think I'll... carry him.

               Freddy prepares to lift the Monster. Suddenly: THE MUSIC 
               STOPS! The Monster's eyeballs float menacingly towards Freddy.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

                                     INGA
                         Doctor! The music has stopped.

               The Monster's hands creep around Freddy's neck.

                                     FREDDY
                         Do you think you can sing it?

                                     INGA
                         Me? Sing?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes -- quickly, dear!

               The Monster is really choking Freddy now.

                                     INGA
                         I'd be so nervous.

                                     FREDDY
                         This is not the finals -- just sing!

                                     INGA
                              (singing)
                         It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-
                         nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's

               The Monster is temporarily distracted. Then he gives Inga an 
               angry look. The is not the music that he wants.

                                     INGA
                              (singing)
                         Be-cause it does what you want it to 
                         do.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

               The Monster's hands tighten around Freddy's neck.

                                     INGA
                              (singing)
                         It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-

                                     FREDDY
                         Stop -- singing!!!

               Igor WALKS IN, holding a violin and bow. He sees the Monster 
               choking Freddy.

                                     IGOR
                         How's it going?

                                     FREDDY
                         What did you find out?

                                     IGOR
                         Someone was playing this in the music 
                         room.

                                     FREDDY
                         Where is he?

                                     IGOR
                         How do you know it was a 'he'?

                                     FREDDY
                         All right -- where is she?

                                     IGOR
                         How do you know it was a 'she'?

                                     FREDDY
                              (gasping his last 
                              breath)
                         Bring -- me -- the -- violin!

                                     IGOR
                         Can you play it?

                                     FREDDY
                         Maybe... if you get here on time.

               Igor goes to Freddy and hands him the violin and bow.

               Freddy plays the TRANSYLVANIA LULLABY to the best of his 
               ability. The Monster's hands begin to loosen.

                                     INGA
                         It's working! Oh, Doctor -- you play 
                         beautifully.

                                     IGOR
                         Do you know the theme from 'Doctor 
                         Zhivago'?

                                     FREDDY
                         Get the sedative ready!

                                     MONSTER
                              (soft and loving)
                         MMmmm! Mmmmm!

               The Monster hugs Freddy's face. Freddy, still playing the 
               violin, pats the operating table for the Monster to "lie 
               down." He does -- holding onto Freddy's face.

                                     INGA
                         I think he wants to be tucked in.

                                     FREDDY
                         Get a blanket from under that shelf!

               Inga gets the blanket. The Monster holds Freddy's head onto 
               his chest, as Freddy continues playing. Inga and Igor spread 
               the blanket over the operating table, then gently tuck the 
               Monster in "bed." The Monster pulls Freddy into bed with him 
               and snuggles against Freddy's shoulder. Freddy continues 
               playing the violin under the covers.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Inga)
                         All right -- give it to him!

                                     INGA
                         Are you serious??

                                     FREDDY
                         Give him the sedative!

                                     INGA
                         Oh! Yes, Doctor.

               She prepares the hypodermic, then lifts up a small section 
               of the blanket -- AWAY FROM OUR VIEW -- and pulls down the 
               Monster's pants a short way.

                                     IGOR
                         He's got quite a tush.

               She puts the needle in.

                                     FREDDY
                         Did you do it?

                                     INGA
                         I think so.

                                     FREDDY
                         Good! It shouldn't take more than a 
                         few seconds.

               Freddy gradually stops playing.

                                     MONSTER
                              (quietly, angry)
                         MMMMmmmmmmmm!

               Freddy starts playing. The Monster kisses him.

                                     INGA
                         I'm getting tired.

                                     IGOR
                         Why don't we all turn in? It's been 
                         a long day.

                                     FREDDY
                         Wait -- I'm sure he's out by now. 
                         That shot was strong enough to stop 
                         a horse.

               Freddy gradually stops playing. One of the Monster's hands 
               sleepily closes around Freddy's throat.

                                     IGOR
                         See you at breakfast, then!

               Freddy continues playing.

                                     INGA
                         Good night, Doctor.

                                     FREDDY
                              (afraid to disturb 
                              the Monster)
                         Good night!

               Igor and Inga LEAVE.

               NEW ANGLE

               Freddy is left alone with the Monster, still playing the 
               violin.

                                     FREDDY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Thanks... for all your help.

                                     IGOR
                              (o.s., from behind a 
                              wall)
                         That's what we're paid for.

               Freddy looks at the Monster -- whose contented face nestles 
               against Freddy's chin.

                                     FREDDY
                              (as he plays the violin)
                         This song. This haunting melody. 
                         This ancient, quaintly atonal folk 
                         tune... is driving -- me -- crackers! 
                         I can't go on -- do you understand?? 
                         Can NOT go on playing this 
                         pathogenically rotten song. If you're 
                         not asleep yet, then kill me if you 
                         have to, but at the count of three... 
                         I stop! One!... Incidentally, I was 
                         thinking of making a big breakfast 
                         tomorrow -- blueberry waffles and 
                         crisp bacon. Two!... By the way, I'm 
                         sorry I yelled at you before -- I 
                         must have been over-tired. Anyway, I 
                         meant to apologize and just forgot. 
                         Two!... Maybe tomorrow would be a 
                         good day just to relax -- go for a 
                         swim, maybe do a little water skiing. 
                         Well... we'll see after we finish a 
                         nice breakfast. Three!

               Freddy stops playing. The monster is sound asleep.

               Freddy puts the violin down, throws off the blanket, then 
               ties the straps that bind the Monster to the operating table.

                                     FREDDY
                              (when the Monster is 
                              firmly tied)
                         Spoiled Sissy!

               Freddy picks up the violin again and stares at it.

                                     FREDDY
                         The song is over!

               He looks at the sleeping Monster.

                                     FREDDY
                         Das lied ist aus!

               He breaks the violin in half. Immediately, he feels a sense 
               of relief and lightheadedness.

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh! Oh my! What a strange feeling 
                         that was. My head -- I felt such a 
                         pressure, splitting my head apart. I 
                         feel so relieved and lightheaded. 
                         That horrible pressure... like 
                         voices... all calling to me, imploring 
                         me... swearing at me. Well, it's 
                         over now, thank goodness.
                              (he turns to the 
                              Monster)
                         Oh... my poor Doctor Delbruck.
                              (he strokes the 
                              Monster's head)
                         Doctor, Doctor... what have I done 
                         to you? Was habe ich von Dir gamacht? 
                         Your magnificent brain, locked in 
                         this... pile of... Forgive me, Doctor. 
                         I thought -- for science only. I 
                         couldn't stand the thought to mankind. 
                         I was a fool! How dangerous is the 
                         acquirement of knowledge, and how 
                         much happier is that man who believes 
                         his native town to be the world, 
                         than he who aspires to become greater 
                         than his nature will allow. Can you 
                         ever forgive me?

               He puts his head down in silent prayer. MUSIC: ANOTHER VIOLIN 
               PLAYS: THE EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY. Freddy's body tenses. 
               We cannot see his face, but his fingers go to his temples. 
               He slowly raises his head.

                                     FREDDY
                         That's a knockout tune! That tune is 
                         a winner. You can't call it 'wishy-
                         washy'... like some people I know.  
                         That song is going places.
                              (he looks at the 
                              Monster)
                         And so are we -- Blubber Boy. With 
                         your body, and the brain of that 
                         kraut -- we'll be 'Number One' in no 
                         time.

               The MUSIC is PLAYING LOUDER and FASTER.

                                     FREDDY
                         Right, voices?? I hear you skipping 
                         away in there. 'Do better than your 
                         father!' You're telling me I will. 
                         'Do better than my grandfather!?' 
                         I'll make my famous grandfather look 
                         like a part-time nurse.

               He rises.

                                     FREDDY
                         There's no stopping now. Destiny is 
                         too potent. I -- want -- perfection!

               A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!

                         there is.

               He grabs the Monster's head and hits it. A CRACK OF THUNDER!

               FADE IN:

               MONTAGE - INT. CONVERTED BALLET REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

               Mirrors and a warmup bar run along three walls.

               Throughout the Montage, the Monster is dressed in leotards 
               and lederhosen.

               1st Piece - INT. CONVERTED BALLET REHEARSAL ROOM

               The Monster is at the warmup bar, doing ballet exercises to 
               the MUSIC OF CHOPIN -- which is being PLAYED on the PIANO by 
               Igor.

               Inga -- also in leotards -- is at the bar in front of the 
               Monster, so that he may follow her example.

               Freddy sits on a chair in the middle of the floor, pounding 
               out the "count" with a long stick.

                                     FREDDY
                         And one and two and three and four 
                         and lift -- lift, three and four and 
                         don't look sad for sympathy; you 
                         know we only stop to pee. And lift -- 
                         lift, three and four and try and not 
                         to break the floor.

               2nd Piece - INT. CONVERTED BALLET REHEARSAL ROOM

               Freddy and Inga are wearing different clothes -- to denote 
               change of time.

               Inga only watches this time, as the Monster tries a few 
               "points" and "turns" across the room on his own.

               Igor plays Chopin.

                                     FREDDY
                         And one and two and point your toes 
                         and two and two and stretch you thighs 
                         and three and two and lift your knees 
                         and watch that nasty temper, please.

               The Monster is getting angry.

                                     FREDDY
                         And one and two and point your toes...

               Igor stops playing the piano, but continues speaking with 
               the "count."

                                     IGOR
                         And Oh-oh, Oh-oh... there he goes.

               The Monster's hands are around Freddy's neck.

                                     FREDDY
                         And oopy, not so hasty, please, and 
                         stretch your legs and lift your knees.

               The monster, involuntarily, continues his footwork while he 
               is trying to choke Freddy.

               Freddy picks up a violin from under his chair and plays the 
               EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY -- BUT IN THE SAME RHYTHM THEY 
               HAVE BEEN USING, so that not a "count" is missed.

                                     FREDDY
                         And even though we're nose to nose, 
                         Always, always point your toes! Don't 
                         knot your fists like monsters do, 
                         but light-ly, gently, pas de deux. A 
                         grateful bot who has a chance would 
                         never kill if he could dance. So 
                         take your fingers off my throat and 
                         two -- remove them from my chest and 
                         three and two, continue please; I 
                         didn't say 'It's time to rest.' Don't 
                         stand flat footed; point your toes! 
                         Don't hang your hands like some dumb 
                         clod; Always lift them gracefully, 
                         like little chil-dren praying to 
                         God. That's the way an angel grows 
                         but first he learns to POINT his 
                         TOES!

               Igor continues playing Chopin. The Monster goes back to his 
               exercises.

                         And one and two and stretch your 
                         thighs and two and two and lift your 
                         knees...

               The angelic face of the Monster sits in perfect concentration, 
               as he prepares to play the harp.

               He lightly ripples the strings: his face lights up!

               He ripples the strings a second time: he is in ecstasy.

               On the third ripple: ALL THE STRINGS COME OUT in his hands, 
               like a mass of spaghetti.

               Freddy, Igor, and Inga try not to look at each other.

               The Monster is dancing "reasonably" well with A YOUNG 
               BALLERINA.

               Freddy, Igor and Inga watch with great expectation.

               The Monster lifts the Ballerina up, and sets her down.

               He lifts her up, and sets her down.

               Now he takes her hand, prepares for the "big Twirl," lifts 
               her up, and twirls her through the air.

               The Young Ballerina sails out of the open window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Freddy and the Monster stand over two enormous xylophones.

               Each holds his two wooden hammers.

               Freddy -- at his xylophone -- passionately laces into Rimsky 
               Korsokov's "FLIGHT OF THE BUMBLE BEE."

               The Monster strokes -- in perfect time -- the LAST NOTE of 
               each phrase.

               The crowning glory is a slow bridge of SEVEN PERFECT NOTES 
               BY THE MONSTER.

               When the piece is finished, Freddy, the Monster, Igor and 
               Inga all hug each other in triumph.

               stands on a stage, dressed in tails.

                                     FREDDY
                         And now, my fellow scientists and 
                         neurosurgeon...I must ask you to... 
                         suspend belief. For up until now, 
                         you have seen the Creature perform 
                         the simple mechanics of motor 
                         activity. That this Creature was an 
                         inanimate blob, which I endowed with 
                         the secret of life -- yes!...in all 
                         honesty -- that showed some measure 
                         of skill on my part. But for what 
                         you are about to see next... we must 
                         enter -- quietly -- into the realm 
                         of genius. I say this modestly, only 
                         because I am, myself, as in awe of 
                         the gifts I possess as if I were 
                         observing them in some other person. 
                         I think of them, only, as a loan. 
                         Grateful, of course... that my credit 
                         is good. Thus, with the accumulated 
                         knowledge of Chemistry, Electricity, 
                         Neurosurgery... and art... I now 
                         present what was once an inarticulate 
                         mass of lifeless tissues. Ladies and 
                         gentlemen... Mesdames et Messieurs... 
                         Damen und Herren...The Creature!

               Freddy sits down at a beautiful grand piano. He plays a short 
               trill up the keyboard.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as A SPOTLIGHT hits the darkness next to him.

               And there -- IN TOP HAT AND TAILS -- stands the Monster. He 
               is heavily made up.

                         where to go to, why don't you...

               The Monster accompanies the music with short, simple "Soft 
               Shoe" steps.

                         with a hang-nail.

               The monster gets another tomato in his face.

                         satisfaction. I know it's tough, but 
                         look at how far we've come! Are you 
                         going to throw it all away now??

               The Monster thinks, as the tomato drips down his face.

               He is touched by Freddy's reasoning, but still burning with 
               resentment.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmmmmm.

                         Don't you think I know that? But 
                         what are you judging by? Bucharest??? 
                         This was always a hick town. They 
                         can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company 
                         to come in here. Are you going to 
                         let these idiots get the best of 
                         you?... Or are you going to stand up 
                         like a man and show them that you've 
                         got more dignity in your little finger 
                         than they've got in all their beer-
                         bloated bodies put together?

               The Monster considers this plea for a moment. Then gives 
               Freddy a colossal W H A C K and jumps into the Audience.

                                     FREDDY
                         I'm a failure.

                                     IGOR
                         Come on, Froderick -- none of that.

                                     INGA
                         Look how far we've come.

                                     IGOR
                         You can't expect to iron out all the 
                         kinks in one night.

                                     INGA
                         I think the doctor is a genius! Don't 
                         you, Igor?

                                     IGOR
                         Why certainly. Don't you, Frau 
                         Blucher?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                         He's a failure.

               Freddy gives her a cold stare.

                                     FREDDY
                         What are you waiting around for, 
                         pickle puss?

                                     FRAU BLUCHER
                              (handling him a cable)
                         This wire came while you were gone. 
                         Your fiancee will be arriving any 
                         moment.

                                     FREDDY
                         Elizabeth!?!
                              (he reads the cable)
                         'Can't waits any longer. Arrive in 
                         your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God! 
                         Not tonight.

                                     INGA
                         Why, doctor... how wonderful for 
                         you.

                                     FREDDY
                         Wonderful? It's terrible! Terrible, 
                         terrible, terrible, terrible, 
                         terrible!

               Freddy storms out of the room.

                                     IGOR
                         She sounds fascinating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COBBLESTONED ALLEY - NIGHT

               A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL walks innocently along the narrow, 
               menacing alley, lit only by moonlight.

               Behind her, there slowly appears a growing, TWENTY-FOUR 
               SHADOW.

               When the shadow is almost upon her, the Girl turns around 
               and faces her pursuer.

               It is her BABY BROTHER, holing a long balloon in each hand.

                                     SIX-YEAR-OLD-GIRL
                              (grabbing him)
                         Mit kommen, mit kommen. Du bist
                         immer eine schlafmutzigem 
                         blindschleiche.

               She gives him a slap on the behind and pulls him along.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GRANDFATHER CLOCK

               It is ten o'clock. GONG.

               INT. RECEPTION HALL

               The front door opens and Elizabeth comes in. Frau Blucher 
               and a COACHMAN can be SEEN in the b.g.

               Freddy stands in dressing gown and ascot. Inga and Igor wait 
               politely in the rear.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Darling!

                                     FREDDY
                         Darling!

               They embrace.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Surprised?

                                     FREDDY
                         Surprised!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Love me?

                                     FREDDY
                         Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn 
                         in?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Darling!?!

                                     FREDDY
                         I mean, it's been a long day. I'm 
                         sure you must be as tired as I am. 
                         Oh! These are my assistants: Inga 
                         and Ayegor.

               Freddy turns to get some luggage from the Coachman.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (stepping up to Inga)
                         How do you do?

                                     INGA
                         Very well. So nice to meet you at 
                         last.

               Elizabeth steps up to Igor.

                                     IGOR
                         Darling!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Hello...?

                                     IGOR
                         Surprised?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Well... yes.

                                     IGOR
                         Miss me?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I...

               Freddy approaches them with Elizabeth's two suitcases: One 
               very large, and one very small.

                                     FREDDY
                         Ready, darling?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Yes. I am a bit tired, after all.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Igor)
                         Give me a hand with these, will you, 
                         Ayegor?

                                     IGOR
                         Certainly, master.

               Igor takes the small suitcase, and, with Inga, leads Elizabeth 
               and Freddy up the stairs. Freddy struggles with the large 
               suitcase. Frau Blucher follows behind.

               ON THE STAIRWAY

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What a strange fellow.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. 
                         Harmless, though.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Why does he call you 'master'?

               Freddy stares at her.

                                     FREDDY
                         Are you suggesting I call him 
                         master???

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No, of course not. I just meant...

                                     FREDDY
                         All right then!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The Monster walks in cautiously. No one seems to take any 
               particular notice of him.

               He walks up to the MAITRE D' and taps his back.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Yes, sir, name, please?

                                     MONSTER
                         Food!

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Do you have a reservation?

                                     MONSTER
                         Food!!

                                     MAITRE D'
                         I'm sorry, sir. We only seat by 
                         reservation.

                                     MONSTER
                         Drink!

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Oh, no sir-ee. If you don't have a 
                         reservation you can skip to ma-loo.

               The Monster grabs the Maitre D' by the lapels

                                     MONSTER
                         Foooooood!

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Now just one moment. There's no need 
                         for roughhousing. Have you ever tried 
                         a tip?

                                     MONSTER
                         GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Franz! Help! Lunatic!

               NEW ANGLE

               As the monster picks up the maitre D' and throws him into a 
               crowd.

               The Monster attacks the restaurant. LADIES, GENTLEMEN AND 
               WAITERS scream.

               PANDEMONIUM.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Elizabeth -- in a long, satin robe -- stands over Freddy, 
               who sits staring into a fire.

                                     FREDDY
                         Poor Delbruck! There must be some 
                         way to reach him -- to control that 
                         body.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Darling, you mustn't worry so.

                                     FREDDY
                         But there's a genius inside that 
                         body -- crying out for love and 
                         understanding and normal human 
                         relationships. I just have to find 
                         some way to re-establish his 
                         communications system.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         But you can't do that at night. And 
                         even if you could -- it would cost a 
                         fortune. Come to bed, darling.

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck. Was will 
                         dien tachlas von Dir?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You've done everything that's humanly 
                         possible, Frederick. Oh, darling, 
                         I'm so worried about you -- you need 
                         rest.

                                     FREDDY
                         I suppose you're right.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Of course I am. Now come along like 
                         a good boy.

               He gets up.

                                     FREDDY
                         What would I do without you?

               They kiss.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is your room just down the hall? 
                         ...in case I get frightened during 
                         the night?

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, but... I thought, perhaps 
                         tonight, under the circumstances, I 
                         might... stay here with you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh, darling! Don't let's spoil 
                         everything.

                                     FREDDY
                         I don't want to spoil anything -- I 
                         just want to top it all off.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Would you want me, now, like this, 
                         so soon before our wedding?... So 
                         near we can almost touch it? Or wait 
                         a little while longer, when I can 
                         give myself without hesitation?... 
                         When I can be totally and unashamedly 
                         yours??

                                     FREDDY
                         That's a tough choice.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is it worth taking a chance?

                                     FREDDY
                         I suppose you're right.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Of course I am. Now give me a kiss 
                         and say good night like my good boy.

               They kiss.

                                     FREDDY
                         Good night.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         That's my good boy.

               Freddy steps out into the:

               INT. HALLWAY

               Elizabeth blows him a kiss and slowly closes her door.

               Freddy stands for a moment, then walks to the door next to 
               Elizabeth's room and knocks.

               ANGLE ON INGA

               She is wearing a flimsy nightgown, opens the door.

                                     INGA
                         Why, Doctor... is anything the matter?

                                     FREDDY
                         Just passing through the night.

                                     INGA
                         What's wrong, Doctor? You seem... 
                         lonely.

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh, a little. But it's not just 
                         physical loneliness. It's the pangs 
                         that come from missing someone 
                         intellectually... as I have you.

                                     INGA
                         I've missed you intellectually, too, 
                         Doctor.

               He stares at her almost "see-through" nightgown.

                                     FREDDY
                         It's terrible -- the price society 
                         demands in the name of fidelity... 
                         ultimately?

                                     INGA
                         Not fooling around.

                                     FREDDY
                         I know, but I mean -- not fooling 
                         around physically?... Or not fooling 
                         around intellectually?

                                     INGA
                         I see what you mean.

                                     FREDDY
                         There can never... ever... be anything 
                         physical between us.

               You know that, dear.

                                     INGA
                         I know Frederick.

               He is staring at her breasts.

                                     FREDDY
                         It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.

                                     INGA
                         Of course not.

                                     FREDDY
                         For that matter, it wouldn't be fair 
                         to you, or to me.

               On the word "you", he touches Inga's breast to emphasize his 
               point. On the word "me", he touches his own chest.

               Pause.

                                     INGA
                         What?

                                     FREDDY
                         I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... 
                         or to me.

                                     INGA
                         Nor to Elizabeth.

                                     FREDDY
                         No. Nor to Elizabeth.

                                     INGA
                         We all have our feelings. I know 
                         that I have mine. And... I wouldn't 
                         want to hurt yours.

               On the word "mine", she touches her chest for emphasis. On 
               the word "yours", she places her hand on Freddy's chest and 
               rubs it a little.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, I do have my feelings. And, of 
                         course, you have yours.

               He rubs her chest.

                                     INGA
                         And Elizabeth has hers.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, Elizabeth has hers.

                                     INGA
                         But, after all, you have yours.

               She unbuttons a button of his pajama top so that she can 
               touch his chest better.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes, I have mine.

                                     INGA
                         And I have mine.

                                     FREDDY
                         Yes... yes, you have yours.

                                     INGA
                         Why don't we talk inside?

                                     FREDDY
                              (keeping one hand on 
                              her chest)
                         Well...
                              (he looks at his watch)
                         ...perhaps for a few minutes.

               They go into Inga's room.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BURGOMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               VILLAGERS, with torches and DOGS, stand on the street, in 
               front of the Burgomeister's steps.

                                     FIRST VILLAGER
                         Burgomeister Krempen.

                                     SECOND VILLAGER
                         Burgomeister Krempen!

                                     THIRD VILLAGER
                              (pounding on the door)
                         Burgomeister Krempen!

                                     FOURTH VILLAGER
                         Mayor Krempen!

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                              (opening the door)
                         What is it? What's going on?

                                     FIRST VILLAGER
                         The monster, sir. The Monster is 
                         loose.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Do you realize it's after eight 
                         o'clock???

                                     SECOND VILLAGER
                         Yes, sir, but the monster. He's 
                         escaped!

                                     THIRD VILLAGER
                         He's running through the countryside, 
                         terrorizing the villagers. No one is 
                         safe.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         What do you mean 'the' monster -- as 
                         if this happened every Sunday. You 
                         mean 'a' monster.

                                     FOURTH VILLAGER
                         No, sir, it's 'the' monster. The 
                         Frankenstein monster.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Oh, Tommy Rot!

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                         Yes!
                         Frankenstein!
                         The Frankenstein monster!

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Now wait a minute! Just wait a minute!

               They quiet down.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Now see here! There'll be no more 
                         wild accusations bandied about while 
                         I'm still Burgomeister of this 
                         village. If there is mischief afoot, 
                         the way to find out is to confront 
                         the man with the charges brought 
                         against him.It's the only decent 
                         thing to do. And as long as I'm 
                         Burgomeister of your village -- a 
                         man's name is still his honor.

                                     FIRST VILLAGER
                         But it's true, sir. Young Master 
                         Freddy -- he's come from America and 
                         read all of his grandfather's secret 
                         notes. They've started the whole 
                         business all over again, sir.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         That swine!

                                     SECOND VILLAGER
                         It's in the blood, sir. The whole 
                         family is insane.

                                     THIRD VILLAGER
                         He's got to be put away.

                                     FOURTH VILLAGER
                         And the monster destroyed!

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                         Yes!
                         The monster!
                         Kill the monster!
                         The monster must be destroyed!

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Now see here! Before we go running 
                         about, killing people, we'd better 
                         make damned sure of our facts. A 
                         riot is an ugly thing... and once 
                         you get one started -- there's little 
                         chance of stopping it short of 
                         bloodshed.

               "Groans" of disappointment from assorted Villagers.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         So the first thing we'll do, is march 
                         calmly up to the Frankenstein castle 
                         and have a nice little chat with our 
                         good doctor. Now then! Who doesn't 
                         have a torch and a dog? All right -- 
                         follow me!

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                         Yay!
                         Down with Frankenstein!
                         Kill the monster!

               They all run off ahead of the Burgomeister.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INGA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Freddy and Inga are under the sheets. Only their faces can 
               be SEEN.

                                     FREDDY
                         It wouldn't be right... you know 
                         that.

                                     INGA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     FREDDY
                         It wouldn't be fair to her.

                                     INGA
                         Yes, I know.

                                     FREDDY
                         You've got to help me to remain 
                         faithful.

                                     INGA
                         Yes, I will.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...But an intellectual relationship, 
                         like this -- we could have as often 
                         as we wanted. Three times a day -- 
                         anything!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The angry Villagers are marching and shouting, gathering up 
               steam on their way to the Frankenstein castle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Elizabeth is just finished brushing her hair, humming quietly 
               to herself. She stands up and blows out the candles near her 
               mirror.

               She walks to some French doors that open onto a small balcony.  
               She opens the glass doors and looks at:

               ANGLE ON MOON

               Bright and full.

               BACK TO SCENE

               She takes a breath of fresh air, then closes the doors and 
               walks to her large double bed. She slips off her robe -- 
               revealing her thin body in delicate nightgown.

               Suddenly she hears:

               "MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm."

               She turns towards the French doors and listens. She decides 
               that it was nothing and gets into bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CASTLE - NIGHT

               The Burgomeister and the Villagers are at the steps of the 
               castle. The Burgomeister pounds on the front door.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM

               Elizabeth lies in bed, illuminated be the flames from her 
               fireplace.

               There is the soft SOUND of CURTAINS FLAPPING.

               The French doors have been opened -- the silk curtains 
               flapping from a breeze outside.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. CASTLE

               The Burgomeister pounds louder and louder on the front door.

               Finally the door opens and Freddy appears in his robe. He 
               looks at the angry mob.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Frederick Frankenstein?

                                     FREDDY
                         You have the wrong house.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         And who might you be?

                                     FREDDY
                         Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?

                                     FREDDY
                         No!

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         What was your grandfather's name?

                                     FREDDY
                         Victor Frankenstein.

               Pause, as the Burgomeister tries to fit the pieces together.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM

               Elizabeth has a contented smile on her face. Her eyes are 
               closed.

               A LARGE SHADOW grows against the wall behind her.

               The shadow crosses her face and blots out her key light from 
               the fireplace.

               She opens her eyes and looks ahead.  Her face freezes in 
               terror.

               EXT. THE CASTLE

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Forgive me for intruding so late at 
                         night, Herr Baron. But an ugly rumor 
                         has it that there are strange goings 
                         on in this castle. These good citizens 
                         are ready to rip you from limb to 
                         limb unless you can offer some 
                         rational explanation for their fears.  
                         How say you?

                                     FREDDY
                         Ugly, vicious rumous.

               A BLOODCURDLING SCREAM!

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                         What was that?
                         Listen!
                         Did you hear that?

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         They say, also, that you have 
                         recreated the horrible monster who, 
                         for so many years, has haunted and 
                         terrorized the God-fearing people of 
                         this village. What say you to that?

                                     FREDDY
                         Poppycock!

               Igor comes running out from inside the castle.

                                     IGOR
                         He's back! He's back! The monster's 
                         back!

               Everyone looks at Freddy.

                                     FREDDY
                         What monster?

                                     IGOR
                         What d'ya mean "What monster?' You 
                         remember...the one we made in the 
                         basement.

               EVERYONE LOOKS AT FREDDY

                                     FREDDY
                         I think we all need a good night's 
                         sleep. Why don't we meet next week 
                         and thrash this thing out?

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         Now wait a minute!

                                     IGOR
                         You don't understand, Master. The 
                         big fellow's broken in and kidnapped 
                         your fiancee.

                                     FREDDY
                         What???

                                     IGOR
                         He's carrying her off now through 
                         the woods.

               Freddy, the Burgomeister and Igor run around to the side of 
               the castle. The Villagers follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDE OF CASTLE

               The Monster can just be SEEN, far below, disappearing into 
               the woods (SEVEN TREES AND A BACKDROP). Elizabeth is slung 
               over his back.

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                         There he is! 
                         That's the monster!
                         After him!
                         Kill him!

               The Burgomeister and all the Villagers run off after the 
               Monster, leaving Freddy an Igor alone.

                                     IGOR
                         What now, boss? A little something 
                         to eat and then join the chase?

                                     FREDDY
                         No!  The only hope now is to get him 
                         back here. If I can just find a way 
                         to relieve the pressure on his 
                         cerebellum...

                                     IGOR
                         That sound good, boss.

                                     FREDDY
                         ...and equalize the imbalance in his 
                         cerebrospinal fluid...

                                     IGOR
                         I like your style, master. How do we 
                         get him here?

                                     FREDDY
                         There's only one way.

                                     IGOR
                         I'll bet it's a doozy.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The Burgomeister and the Villagers are on the hunt.

               The Burgomeister is being pulled along by a GREAT DANE.

               THE VILLAGERS

               climb little hills and rocks. OTHER DOGS are BARKING 
               ferociously.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         There he is!

               The Burgomeister's Great Dane is making so much noise, it's 
               difficult to hear.

                                     1ST VILLAGER
                         What?

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         There he is!!

                                     1ST VILLAGER
                         What?

               The Burgomeister gives his leash a yank and the Great Dane 
               finally stops howling.

                                     BURGOMEUSTER
                              (pointing)
                         I said -- there he is!

               Several Villagers look up and then start SHOOTING at a TALL 
               VILLAGER, who is peeing on top of a distant rock. He has his 
               back turned to the other Villagers.

                                     TALL VILLAGER
                              (turning around in 
                              terror)
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot! It's ME!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               The Monster enters the cave slightly out of breath and stands 
               the "fainted" Elizabeth on her feet.

               He shakes her.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMmmm.

               He shakes her again.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMmmm!

               Elizabeth slowly opens her eyes.

               The Monster smiles sweetly.

               Elizabeth smiles sweetly in return -- forgetting for a moment 
               where she is. Then her smile turns to growing horror. She 
               starts to scream, but the Monster quickly covers her mouth.

               After a moment, the Monster tries to make a "Shhhh" sound 
               with his finger, but as he releases her mouth to use his 
               "Shhh" finger... her SCREAM is still going on.

               He covers her mouth again and shakes her.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmmm!

               He gradually takes his hand from her mouth.

               She is silent;  but her eyes are filled with terror.

               The Monster starts to unbutton his pants.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What...?

               The Monster holds up his hand for her to "Wait a minute."

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmmm!

               He goes on unbuttoning his pants.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What in God's name are you doing?

                                     MONSTER
                         Baack!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What?

                                     MONSTER
                              (motioning for her to 
                              move back)
                         Baack!

               She moves back a foot.

                                     MONSTER
                         Morrr!

               She moves back another foot... fascinated.

               We cannot see what she sees, but what ever it is... she is 
               suddenly filled with awe.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Oh my goodness! Nineteen if it's an 
                         inch.

               The Monster smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The Burgomeister and the Villagers make their way through 
               the rocks and hills, alongside a stream.

               Row boats -- with Villagers, torches and Dogs -- travel up 
               the stream alongside the Villagers who are on land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               Elizabeth and the Monster are lying on a bed of leaves.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Penny for your thoughts.

               The Monster's eyes twinkle lasciviously.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmmmm.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         All right then... seven's always 
                         been my lucky number.

               They are about to kiss, when suddenly the Monster's ears 
               perk up as he hears:

               MUSIC: THE EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY

               He doesn't know where it is coming from.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         What, dear? What is it?

               The Monster gives a pathetic little cry.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMmm!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Is it that music?

                                     MONSTER
                         MMMMM! MMMMM!

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Probably just some nearby cottage. 
                         Nothing to worry about.

               The Monster gets up and starts out of the cave... pulled by 
               forces he doesn't understand.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Where are you going? They've left 
                         their F-M station on, that's all.

               He's gone.

               EXT. ROOF OF CASTLE - NIGHT

               Freddy stands in the night air, playing the violin -- a 
               handkerchief under his chin.

               In front of him is a tall microphone on a stand, with two 
               enormous speakers nearby, facing the woods.

               Igor sits on a chair, near Freddy, like a member of a band 
               waiting for his cue.

               Now Igor gets up, put his trumpet to his lips, and blows 
               just the "bridge." When he is finished, he sits back down 
               and waits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The Monster walks passionately through the woods, fighting 
               the branches in order to get to the music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - NIGHT

               The Burgomeister and the Villagers make their way through 
               the rocks and hills, alongside a stream.

               Rowboats, with Villagers, torches and Dogs, travel up the 
               stream, alongside the Villagers who are on land.

               The rocks, hills and stream all look vaguely familiar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROOF OF CASTLE - NIGHT

               The Monster can be SEEN, crawling up the side of the Castle, 
               trying to make it onto the roof.

               Freddy and Igor move close to the edges of the roof as Freddy 
               continues playing.

                                     FREDDY
                              (to the Monster)
                         You can do it.

               The Monster inches closer.

                                     FREDDY
                         You can do it.

               The Monster inches closer.

                                     IGOR
                         Come on, big fellow!

                                     FREDDY
                              (to Igor)
                         Is everything ready?

                                     IGOR
                         Yes, master. Are you sure you want 
                         to go through with it?

                                     FREDDY
                         It's the only way.

                                     IGOR
                         Okay, boss! But I hope you know what 
                         you're doing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Burgomeister stands in water up to his waist -- his 
               clothes all wet and torn.

               His Great Dane is swimming next to him, BARKING LOUDLY.

                         Wait a minute! Maybe he went back to 
                         the castle.

                                     2ND VILLAGER

                         Now see here. Let's not lose our 
                         heads. We've always listened to our 
                         Burgomeister in the past. We should 
                         have the decency to hear him now.

               The Monster lies on an operating table. His eyes are closed.

               From out of his head come ten thin tubes, connecting to one 
               large tube.

               The large tube travels up, above the Monster's head, then 
               turns across the room for five or six feet, then down again 
               where it connects with ten smaller tubes that are stuck into:

               Frau Blucher sits in a chair, bare-chested.

               She is flaggelating herself with a handful of thin branches.

               She mumbles some mysterious prayer in German -- occasionally 
               looking out through a crack in the door to see what is 
               happening to "her" monster and Freddy.

                         Now see here! What is the meaning of 
                         this?

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         We want the doctor!

                                     IGOR
                         What?

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         We want the doctor!

                                     IGOR
                         What??

                                     FIRST VILLAGER
                         ...Come on, men!

               They sweep right over Igor.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE CLOCK

               It is SIX MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS AFTER TEN.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     SECOND VILLAGER
                              (seeing Freddy lying 
                              on his table)
                         Here's that crackpot doctor. Let's 
                         get him first!

               Several Villagers grab Freddy's body and pull the tubes out 
               from his head.

               THE CLOCK

               ZOOM TO CLOCK. It is only SIX MINUTES AND FIFTY-THREE SECONDS 
               AFTER TEN.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     INGA
                         No! Please!

               Inga is standing further back, near the monster, unable to 
               take her eyes off the clock and dials.

               The Villagers hold Freddy up, over their shoulders, yelling 
               and screaming. They start off with him.

                                     A GIANT VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Put that man down!

               Everyone quiets down and turns towards the Voice.

               There, on his operating table -- holding the removed tubes 
               from his head -- sits the Monster.

                                     AN OLD WOMAN
                         Why... it's the monster!

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         No, it couldn't be.

                                     THIRD VILLAGER
                         Yes it is. It must be.

                                     MONSTER
                              (standing on his 
                              operating table)
                         I said: Put that man down!

               The frightened Villagers carry Freddy back to his table and 
               lay him down.

                                     BURGOMEISTER
                         And who are you, sir, that you order 
                         these people about?

                                     MONSTER
                         I am a relative of the doctor's. I 
                         came to visit him a few weeks ago, 
                         in hopes that this distinguished 
                         member of my family might be able to 
                         help me with a problem that I've had 
                         since birth... and which has caused 
                         more sorrow in my heart than I wish 
                         on any man.

                                     ASSORTED VILLAGERS
                              (whispering)
                         What'd he say? Relative??

                                     MONSTER
                         You see, because of my great size 
                         and the somewhat unusual features of 
                         my head -- when women look at me, 
                         their first impulse is to scream; 
                         children often cry, or vomit; and 
                         men are inclined to beat me over the 
                         head.

               The Laboratory is silent.

                                     MONSTER
                         I lived in hopes of meeting people 
                         who would... overlook my outward 
                         appearance and respect me for whatever 
                         good qualities I had to offer. If 
                         anyone had ever shown a little 
                         kindness, I would have returned it, 
                         I think, at least one hundred times 
                         over. And for that one person's 
                         sake... I would have made piece with 
                         the whole world. Do you understand 
                         what it means -- never to see a kind 
                         or happy face? You could imagine 
                         then, perhaps, how such bitterness 
                         led me, at last, to the brink of 
                         another kind or life. I decided that 
                         if I couldn't inspire love...which 
                         was my deepest hope... I would, 
                         instead... cause fear.

               A quiet shudder runs through the Villagers.

                                     MONSTER
                         But all of that happened to me a 
                         lifetime ago. And I paid for my 
                         crimes... severely. It was just then 
                         that fate, or chance, brought me to 
                         our famous doctor. I found this man 
                         to be vain; I found him to be driven 
                         with ambitions of personal glory, 
                         and consumed with an unquenchable 
                         thirst for power. But even at the 
                         height of his quest -- this ego-
                         driven, brilliant and half-crazed 
                         scientist... always... always... 
                         held an image of me as something 
                         beautiful. And then, at the moment 
                         of truth, when it would have been 
                         easy enough to run and stay out of 
                         danger... he used himself as a guinea 
                         pig, in order to give me a calmer 
                         brain... and a slightly more eloquent 
                         way of speaking. Yes! I am 'The 
                         Monster"... sometimes known as 'Him,' 
                         or occasionally, 'The Creature.' But 
                         they're one and the same. I am that 
                         tall, peculiarly attractive stranger, 
                         with the winning smile. Would you 
                         all get the hell out of here!

               THE VILLAGERS

               mumble and shuffle out of the laboratory.

                                     INGA
                         Oh, 'It's'...you were wonderful. But 
                         I'm so worried about the doctor.

               Igor is listening to Freddy's heartbeat, as Inga and the 
               Monster come to him.

               They all three put their ears to Freddy's chest and listen.

               They smile.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MODERN BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Elizabeth is sitting at her makeup table, dressed in a 
               nightgown, getting ready for bed.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Darling! I hope you didn't find 
                         Daddy's little party too boring. He 
                         did it just for you, and he meant 
                         well. Tell me you liked it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BATHROOM DOOR

                                     A VOICE

                         MMmmm.

                         I know Mummy's just a scatterbrain 
                         without a serious thought in her 
                         head, but... you lover her just a 
                         little bit, don't you?

                                     A VOICE
                              (o.s.)

                                     ELIZABETH'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         I'm ready for bed, sweetheart. Almost 
                         done??

               The bathroom door opens and the Monster steps out. He is 
               dressed in elegant silk pajamas and a handsome robe.

                                     MONSTER
                         MMmmm.

               Even though his electrodes still stick out from his neck, he 
               appears well-groomed. Elizabeth gets into bed and waits for 
               him.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Did you see?... I put a special hamper 
                         in the bathroom just for your shirts. 
                         The other one is just for socks and 
                         poo-poo undies.

                              robe)
                         MMmmm.

               He gets into bead and turns out the table lamp.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Still happy you married me?

                         So this is what it's like to be 
                         completely happy!

               INT. CASTLE BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Freddy is sitting in an easy chair near the fire, dressed in 
               pajamas and reading a newspaper. (Probably the Transylvania 
               Tribune -- International Edition).

               From the bathroom comes the SOUND of Inga, HUMING a pleasant 
               tune to herself.

                                     INGA'S VOICE
                              (o.s., from the 
                              bathroom)
                         Did you have a nice day today?

                                     FREDDY
                         Oh, just the usual: sore throats, a 
                         few colds. Someone who thought he 
                         was a werewolf, and two bladder 
                         transplants.

               She goes on humming.

                                     INGA'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Did you notice the new drapes I put 
                         up in the bedroom?

                                     FREDDY
                              (looking up)
                         Yes!... They're very nice.

                                     INGA'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Oh, I'm glad.

               A short pause of silence, and then Inga begins humming the 
               EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY, quietly unconsciously.

               Freddy's face is hidden behind the newspaper, but he is 
               suddenly completely motionless.

                                     INGA'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         I was hoping you'd like them.

               She continues humming the Lullaby.

               Freddy lowly lowers the newspaper.

               He touches his fingertips to his temple. His eyes open and 
               close, as if he were trying to focus.

               Inga comes out of the bathroom, dressed in her nightgown, 
               and folds back the covers of their large double bed.

               She continues humming.

                                     INGA
                         All right if I turn out the lamp, 
                         sweetheart?

                                     FREDDY
                              (answering)
                         MMmmm.

               She turns out the lamp as she goes on humming. The bedroom 
               is lit only by moonlight and the glow from the fireplace.

                              (as she is arranging 
                              the pillows)
                         Shall I set the alarm?

                                     FREDDY
                         MMMmmm.

               She goes on humming, as she pulls out the stopper on the 
               alarm clock. Freddy rises. His arms hang away from his body, 
               STIFFLY. He walks in fits and jerks.

                                     FREDDY
                         MMMMmmmmm!

                                     INGA
                         Yes, sweetie... I heard you. So! I'm 
                         ready for you, meine Liebe.

               Freddy is standing at the edge of the bed.

                                     INGA
                         Are you ready for me?

                                     FREDDY
                         MMMMmmmmm!

                                     INGA
                         Ready for Fuchsmachen???

                                     FREDDY
                         MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!

                                     INGA
                         I love it when you're excited. Come 
                         then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my 
                         arms and let me hold you.

               Freddy kneels onto the bed.

               A long pause.

                                     INGA
                         Sweetheart... Is this really you???

                                     FREDDY
                         MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TURRET AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE

               Igor sits in the window, blowing his trumpet.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               PULL BACK SLOWLY, until the whole castle in SEEN.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
