                          This film is short.
     
                          This film is fast.
     
     
     
     FADE IN:
     
     EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY 1
     
     The whole island, from the south.  For a second.  Literally.
     
     EXT.  NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY 2
     
     Closer, just the skyline.  For another second.
     
     EXT.  UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY 3
     
     Closer still, the Upper West Side.  For another second.  No
     time to waste admiring the scenery.
     
     EXT.  WEST 83RD STREET - DAY 4
     
     Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
     hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
     broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
     stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
     her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
     year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
     basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
     than Meg, who she resembles.
     
     Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.
     
                          LYDIA
               -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five
               feet deep, forty-two hundred square
               feet, four floors with a rentable
               basement apartment, so five
               altogether, courtyard in back --
     
                          MEG
               Could you slow down a little?
                    (looking back over her
                     shoulder)
               Or we could wait for the car...
     
                          LYDIA
               No cars.  Feet are faster.
     
                          MEG
               How many more do we have after this?
     
                          LYDIA
               None, there's nothing else, you know
               how tight the market is.
     
                          MEG
               This is it?  I told you on the
               phone, I have to be moved in in two
               weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
               that here.
     
                          SARAH
               Mom, it's the sidewalk.
     
                          LYDIA
               Oh, that miserable little prick is
               already leaving.
     
     They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
     townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
     more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
     door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
     coming.
     
                          EVAN
               One day you will learn to respect
               other people's time, Lydia, one day
               you --
     
                          LYDIA
               Evan, I am so sorry, you were a
               saint to wait for us!
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY 5
     
     Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
     the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
     fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
     Sarah still bouncing her basketball.
     
                          EVAN
               This is the middle of the house, the
               entry floor, living room's over
               there.  The kitchen floor's below us
               and there's two bedroom floors
               above.
     
     The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
     authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
     tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
     bouncing the ball in the house.
     
                          EVAN
               It's an enormous amount of space for
               the money and I'll be perfectly
               honest, the family is in no hurry
               whatsoever.
     
     Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
     on bouncing the ball.
     
                          EVAN
               I don't have to tell you there is an
               acute shortage of living space in
               Manhattan right now and this is a
               highly unique property.
     
                          LYDIA
               No ball, kid.
     
     Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
     living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
     out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
     brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
     one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
     
     Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
     window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
     watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
     Can't.
     
     Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
     elevator.
     
                          EVAN
               Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
               the previous owner, was disabled the
               last ten years of his life.  Highly
               unusual, the elevator, you will not
               find this in ninety percent of
               brownstones.
     
                          MEG
               Will they take asking price?  I need
               a two week escrow and I'm already
               approved for the loan.
     
     Lydia turns, gives Meg an "are you insane?" look.
     
                          EVAN
               What say we see the house before we
               dicker, hmm?
                    (starting up the stairs)
               I have to warn you, this is exactly
               the response we expected to get.
               It's a very emotional property.
     
     As he disappears upstairs, Lydia turns to Meg, lowers her
     voice.
     
                          LYDIA
               Who taught you to negotiate?
     
                          SARAH
               It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
               have to pay the price on the tag.
     
     She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
     bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
     turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
     notice her thin hand is shaking.
     
                          MEG
               I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
               money, and... this is more my
               husband's area.
     
     She digs in her purse for a prescription pill bottle and some
     water.
     
                          MEG
               Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
               at...
     
     Lydia watches as she swallows a pill, waiting for Meg to
     finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?
     
                          MEG
               Things, and if I can't prove to my
               soon to-be ex-husband that I can
               provide a suitable place for our
               daughter to live in the next
               fourteen days, it's going to get
               ugly between us.  Uglier.
     
     Lydia just looks at her, no idea what to say.  These two are
     from different places.
     
                          EVAN (O.S.)
                    (from upstairs)
               It would be so lovely if I could
               shot the property before I leave!
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  TOP FLOOR BEDROOM - DAY 6
     
     Evan, Lydia, and Meg poke their heads in a series of rooms,
     one after the other, the tour flying by quickly.  First, an
     upstairs bedroom.  Nice, roomy, looks out on the courtyard.
     
                          EVAN
               Top floor.  Two bedrooms, one
               bathroom.
     
     INT.  DEN - DAY 7
     
     Another floor, another empty room.  The trio passes through.
     
                          EVAN
               Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
               what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used
               it as an office.
     
                          LYDIA
                    (low voice, to Meg)
               He's talking about Bernard
               Pearlstine.
     
     Meg shrugs, who's that?
     
                          EVAN
                    (moving, through a
                     bathroom)
               Master bath.
     
                          LYDIA
               The hotel guy?  It's been in the
               papers lately.  His kids are all
               suing each other over his estate.
               He was a total recluse, paranoid,
               rich as hell, he was worth thirty
               million or something, now it turns
               out they can't find half of it.
                    (singsong)
               Somebody took something didn't
               belong to them!
     
                          EVAN
               I hardly see how family gossip is
               germane to showing the property.
     
                          LYDIA
                    (low, to Meg)
               Stop calling it the property, you
               sound ridiculous.
     
                          EVAN
                    (through a closet)
               Master closet.
     
     From the hallway, there is a GROANING METALLIC sound, the
     elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
     puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
     mouth hurts when he moves it.
     
                          EVAN
               Could the child please stop that?
     
                          LYDIA
               KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
     
     She looks at Meg and winks.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY 8
     
                          EVAN
               And we emerge in the master bedroom.
     
     He checks his watch.
     
     Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
     looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
     door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
     window wall.  She takes two steps back from it.
     
                          MEG
               Something's weird.
     
                          LYDIA
               What?
     
                          MEG
               I don't know, doesn't that corner
               seem funny to you?
     
     She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
     the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
     closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
     closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
     toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
     the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
     it is.
     
                          EVAN
               I was waiting to see if you'd
               notice!  On caravan, no one from our
               office had the slightest idea.
     
     He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
     faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
     pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
     degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
     closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
     closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
     
     Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
     twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
     the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
     Lydia step forward, fascinated.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY 9
     
     From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
     see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
     silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
     windows behind them.
     
                          EVAN
               It's called a panic room.
     
     He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.
     
                          MEG
               A what?
     
                          EVAN
               A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
               castle keep, in medieval times.
     
                          LYDIA
               Oh, I've seen these...
     
                          EVAN
               It's quite in vogue in high end
               construction right now.  One really
               can't be too careful about home
               invasion.
     
     The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
     looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
     -- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
     clothes, blankets -- you get the idea.
     
                          LYDIA
               Hey, this is perfect for you...
                    (Meg scoffs)
               Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
               living alone now.  Your alarm goes
               off, or you head glass break, or for
               whatever reason you think someone's
               broken into your home in the middle
               of the night.  What are you going to
               do?  Call the police and wait until
               they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
               downstairs in your sexy little
               underthings and check it out?  I
               think not!
     
                          EVAN
               Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
               phone line, completely separate, not
               connected to the house's main line
               and never exposed throughout the
               house's infrastructure or outside
               the house -- you can call the
               police; nobody can cut you off.
               Your own ventilation system,
               complete with oxygen scrubber, so
               you've got plenty of fresh air for
               as long as you like.  And a bank of
               video monitors --
     
     He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
     revealing a dozen different views of the house.
     
                          EVAN
               -- covering almost every corner of
               the house.
     
     Meg nods, starting to sweat.
     
                          MEG
               Makes me nervous.
     
                          LYDIA
               Why?
     
                          MEG
               Ever read any Poe?
     
                          LYDIA
               I don't think so, but I love her
               album.
     
                          MEG
               No, Edgar Allen.
     
                          LYDIA
                    (thinks)
               The furniture guy?
     
                          MEG
                    (giving up)
               What's to keep them from prying open
               the door?
     
     Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
     behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
     leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
     submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
     inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.
     
                          EVAN
               Steel, four inches thick.
     
     Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.
     
                          EVAN
               Everything's spring-loaded, even if
               the power's out it's fully
               functional.
     
                          MEG
               Open it.
     
                          LYDIA
               Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with
               this room, did he?
     
                          MEG
               Open the door.
     
                          LYDIA
               And with kids like he's got, no
               wonder he wanted a place to hide.
     
                          EVAN
               That's highly inappropriate.
     
                          MEG
               I said open the door.
     
     Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
     recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
     girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.
     
                          SARAH
               My room.  Definitely my room.
     
     She bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
     
     Meg stands just outside the door to the panic room, regaining
     her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
     already knew.
     
                          LYDIA
               That door is a safely hazard.
     
                          EVAN
               Not at all.
     
     He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
     doorway, one at shoulder height --
     
                          EVAN
               Infrared.  Like the beam in an
               elevator doorway.  Won't let the
               door close if something's blocking
               it.
     
     -- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
     shin height with his hand.
     
                          EVAN
               Watch.
     
     He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
     anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it.
     
                          EVAN
                    (to Lydia)
               Push that button for me, will you?
     
                          MEG
               Don't!
     
     Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
     his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
     the button again.
     
     WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
     reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
     piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
     later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
     the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
     over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
     a corner again.
     
     As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
     She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
     sweat from the side of her face.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY 10
     
     The same house, two weeks later.  The entry floor is piled
     high with moving boxes.  Sarah and Meg lie sprawled out in
     the middle of the black and white tile, arms and legs splayed
     wide, exhausted.
     
     They stare up at the ceiling, beat.
     
                          SARAH
               Too many stairs.
     
                          MEG
               Got us in here, didn't I?
     
                          SARAH
               Shoulda got an apartment.
     
                          MEG
               Well, I know that now.
     
                          SARAH
               478-0150.
     
     Meg raises her hand to her face, she's got her cell phone in
     her palm.
     
                          MEG
               Battery's dead.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - DAY 11
     
     Meg picks up the wall phone in the kitchen, gets a dial tone.
     
                          MEG
               The phone works.
                    (to Sarah)
               Hey, I hooked up the phone.
     
                          SARAH
                    (sarcastic)
               The crowd goes wild.
     
                          MEG
                    (ignoring the slight)
               478...
     
                          SARAH
               0150.
     
     Meg finishes dialing.  It rings, someone answers.
     
                          VOICE
               Perry's Pizza, please hold.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 12
     
     Night has fallen.  Meg and Sarah sit at a small table in the
     middle of the kitchen, surrounded by packing boxes.  They eat
     pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
     Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
     
     Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her
     noticing, shrugs.  I'm human, what do you want me to do, hide
     it?
     
     Sarah looks away, goes back to chewing.  After a moment:
     
                          SARAH
               Fuck him.
     
                          MEG
               Don't.
     
                          SARAH
               Fuck her too.
     
     Meg looks at her, not sure how to confront the open defiance.
     
                          MEG
               I agree.  But don't.
     
     Sarah stares at her for a moment, then goes back to eating.
     
     Meg picks up the bottle of wine.
     
     Sarah's eyes flick over and watch as wine GLUGS into her
     mother's glass.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13
     
     Sarah's bedroom is full of unpacked boxes, but her twin bed
     has been set up and Sarah is in it, hair wet, pajamas on.
     She reads from a book ("Tom Swift and His Repelatron Skyway")
     while Meg, drowsy, lies next to her, listening.
     
                          SARAH
               "Tom's throat felt so dry and tight
               that it was a moment before he could
               make any sound come out.  "Dad!" He
               croaked.  "I'm - inside - the -
               machine!" "Great Scott!"  The elder
               scientist gasped.  He dashed across
               the laboratory and switched off the
               repelatron's motor.  "What happened,
               son?" "The Durafoam hardened, Dad.
               Get a solvent, quick -- you know the
               formula!"
     
     INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 14
     
     In the master bathroom, Meg soaks in a bath.  She is
     exhausted.  She reaches for her wine glass, finishes the last
     of it.
     
     She stretches for the bottle, which is on the floor next to
     her.  She refills the glass.  Again.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 15
     
     Meg, dressed in an old Knicks T-shirt and boxer shorts,
     stands next to the alarm panel in the master bedroom, reading
     from an instruction manual.  She's frustrated.  She mutters,
     slurring, a bit drunk.
     
                          MEG
               Bypass non-ready zones... shunt,
               enter, zone number...
     
     She tries it, pushing a few buttons, but the alarm panel
     BEEPS at her disapprovingly.  She's doing something wrong.
     
     She sighs, sits on the floor, gets serious about figuring out
     the instructions.
     
                          MEG
               Bypass non-ready zones... ah, shunt,
               enter, shunt again, zone number...
               wait...
     
     HER FINGERS
     
     dance over the alarm panel, some time later.  She seems to
     have figured it out, and a small light on the panel lights
     up.
     
     SYSTEM ARMED
     
     The very moment the red light goes on, we cut sharply to --
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 16
     
     -- the darkened panic room, where the dozen small video
     screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
     the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
     not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
     for the night.
     
     The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
     hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
     made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
     have been playing here before bed.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 17
     
     Meg puts sheets on her bed in the master bedroom.
     
     She fills a glass of water, puts it on a box she's using for
     a night table.
     
     She plugs in a battery charger for her cell phone, places the
     phone in the cradle.  It BEEPS.  "Charging."
     
     She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
     water.  It's 12:26.
     
     She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
     
     She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from
     her.
     
     We drift off her, see the clock again.  The time changes, the
     number one dissolves away, changing the time to --
     
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 18
     
     -- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
     door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
     down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
     still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
     even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
     ground floor.
     
     We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
     canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
     the street.
     
     We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
     just as --
     
     -- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
     through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
     driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
     clothes.
     
     The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
     the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
     
     He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
     We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
     
     But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
     again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
     
     The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
     which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
     Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
     
     He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
     onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
     tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
     something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
     
     The fire escape.
     
     The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
     vision.
     
     We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
     start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
     the kitchen, toward the stairwell.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 19
     
     Back in the stairwell, the exact reverse of the shot we saw
     earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
     the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
     way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
     looking down.
     
     A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
     up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
     the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
     and just as we near the skylight --
     
     -- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
     clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
     skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
     
     He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
     to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
     the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
     
     Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
     is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
     
     IN THE CLOSET,
     
     it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
     of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
     
     There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
     it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
     
     Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
     slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
     A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
     edges of the portal.
     
     It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
     something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
     silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
     moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 20
     
     In the master bedroom, a message appears on the alarm panel:
     
     ZONE 19 DISABLED
     
     INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT 21
     
     In the closet, the silver something withdraws and the roof
     access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
     night sky above.  But we're inside.
     
     And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
     through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
     climbs silently down the ladder.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 22
     
     In bed, Meg stirs.  An alcohol sleep is a restless one, and
     she's suffering.
     
     She sits up groggily, chugs a glass of water.  Lies down
     again.
     
     INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 23
     
     One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
     the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
     going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
     happens to glance to the side as he does so.
     
     He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
     floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
     disturbs him.
     
     A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
     bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
     Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
     the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
     countertop.
     
     There's a moving box on the countertop.  His eyes widen.
     This is news to him, bad news.
     
     He takes a step back and a breath.  He turns, looks to the
     end of the hall.  His eyes now adjusted to the darkness, he
     notices something he didn't see before, something coming from
     under the door to the fourth floor bedroom.
     
     Light.  From inside.  From another nightlight.
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 24
     
     In the top floor bedroom, a nightlight burns in another
     outlet.  Nearby, Sarah is asleep in bed, the covers kicked
     off.
     
     The door to Sarah's bedroom glides open, terribly slowly.
     The Man stands in the doorway, staring, aghast, at the
     mountain of moving boxes piled in the room.  His gaze falls
     on Sarah in the bed.
     
     The Man just stares, beside himself.  His lips mouth a word,
     soundlessly.  Doesn't take a lip reader to guess it.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 25
     
     In the master bedroom, Meg flops over in bed, facing away
     from the doorway, really having a rough go of it.  She slept
     too hard before, now she's awake, her head is killing her,
     she's really paying the price of four glasses of wine.
     
     She lies still, on her side, facing us.
     
     Behind her, the bedroom door moves, silently.
     
     Opening.
     
     The Man stands there, one finger still on the door he's just
     pushed open.  He stares at the sleeping form of Meg on the
     bed, whose back is to him.  He has no idea she's awake.
     
     Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in
     the doorway to her bedroom.
     
     Noiselessly, the Man moves away, down the hall.  The moment
     his head disappears down the stairwell --
     
     -- Meg flops over again, facing the doorway.  She closes her
     eyes, gives sleep another try.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 26
     
     The Man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in
     exasperation at the packing boxes all around him.  He goes to
     the front window, peers outside.  He reaches for a light
     switch on his right.
     
     Through the window, we can see the stoop light go on.  Then
     off, then on and off again.
     
     Still through the window, we see the side panel door of the
     van slide open.
     
     TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark
     clothes.  They also carry satchels.
     
     They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window
     as they approach us.  The first intruder (who has a name,
     it's BURNHAM) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his
     silvery strip through the gap.  Another HUM and spark.
     
     AN ALARM PANEL
     
     flashes again.
     
     ZONE 1 DISABLED
     
     IN THE KITCHEN,
     
     Burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys
     slip inside.  RAOUL is a hulking figure whose back seems to
     rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it
     looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him
     forward.  JUNIOR is much smaller, very high-strung, dresses
     like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the
     street is Park Avenue.
     
     They all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Fuck.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I know.
     
                          RAOUL
               What?
     
                          BURNHAM
               A woman and a little girl, both
               asleep upstairs.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Fuck!
     
                          BURNHAM
               Keep your voice down.
     
                          JUNIOR
               They're not supposed to be here!
     
                          BURNHAM
               This was your department, Junior.
     
                          JUNIOR
               They're not supposed to be here!
     
                          BURNHAM
               That's why the key didn't work, they
               changed the locks.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Fourteen day escrow, man, that's
               almost three weeks!  They shouldn't
               be here for another week!  They
               don't own this house yet!
     
                          BURNHAM
                    (pause)
               Exactly how is fourteen days almost
               three weeks?
     
                          JUNIOR
               Fourteen business days.  Escrow is
               always business days.
     
     Burnham sighs.
     
                          JUNIOR
               I mean, right?  Isn't it?
     
                          BURNHAM
               You're an idiot.
     
     Raoul steps forward, shoves Burnham with both hands in the
     chest.
     
                          RAOUL
               Watch your mouth.
     
                          JUNIOR
               It's okay, Raoul.
     
                          BURNHAM
                    (to Junior)
               Who is this guy?
     
                          JUNIOR
               Raoul is cool.  That's all you need
               to know.
     
                          BURNHAM
               This is insane.  I'm outta here.
     
     He starts for the door.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We
               can still handle this.
                    (to Raoul)
               Can we still handle this?
     
                          RAOUL
               It's just the woman and the kid?
     
                          BURNHAM
               Unless Daddy comes back later.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Daddy's not coming back, she's in
               the middle of a divorce, it's just
               the two of them.  We're okay, here.
                    (to Raoul)
               We can do this, right?
     
                          RAOUL
               You're fuckin' A we can do this.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Not with me.  Not with people.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Forty-five minutes.  That's all you
               said you need.  That's like nothing.
     
                          BURNHAM
               She'll call the cops, they'll be
               here before I get unpacked.
     
                          JUNIOR
               So we keep an eye on her.  Raoul can
               totally administrate that part.
     
                          RAOUL
               No problem.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I don't want Raoul to administrate
               that part.
     
                          JUNIOR
               They won't get hurt.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What about us?  What if she has a
               gun?
     
                          JUNIOR
               Raoul, what in God's name do we do
               if she has a gun?
     
     Raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into
     his belt.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Asshole.
     
                          JUNIOR
               A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and
               you insult him?  Hey, who's the
               idiot?  Huh?
     
                          BURNHAM
               Where did you get this clown?
     
                          JUNIOR
               I met him at the tables, same as
               you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we
               have a little muscle right about
               now.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What tables?  I've never seen him
               before.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Different tables.
     
                          BURNHAM
                    (to Raoul)
               The fuck did you bring a gun for?
     
                          RAOUL
               You're welcome.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Peace out.
     
     He moves for the door.  Junior, trying desperately to hold
     this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his
     back.
     
                          JUNIOR
               We can't do it without you, Burnham.
     
     Junior starts at Burnham.  Raoul stares at Burnham.
     
                          JUNIOR
               It's still a good plan.  It's
               just... got a twist.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yeah.  Kidnapping.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't
               kidnap somebody in their own house.
               It's just breaking and entering,
               unless we take 'em someplace.  Or
               something like that, I'm pretty
               sure.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Pure idiot.
     
                          JUNIOR
               I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An
               idiot's grandson.  I'm third-
               generation idiot.  But for once in
               my life I had a good idea, and I'm
               not giving up so easy.  You are?
               Are you actually telling me that for
               the first time in your life you're
               gonna throw your cards on the table
               and go home early?  I can't believe
               my eyes.
                    (Burnham hesitates)
               Fourteen million dollars upstairs,
               Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole.
               Baby, you'll be so far out of the
               hole you could draw bricks every
               night for the next twenty years and
               still shit green.
                    (Burnham sways)
               Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 27
     
     Meg sits up in bed.  She's bleary, her head feels like
     someone rested a manhole cover on it.  She gets up, in the
     dark, and staggers off toward the bathroom door, feeling her
     way with her arms, her eyes not adjusted to the dark.
     
     She steps through the door.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 28
     
     She walks into the bathroom and feels around for a light
     switch, but can't find it.  She blinks, squints, tries to get
     her bearings.  The only light is a harsh white glow that
     comes from along one wall, from a bank of tiny video
     monitors.
     
     She finds the light switch, flicks it on, it nearly blinds
     her.  She's not in the bathroom.  She's wandered into the
     panic room by mistake.
     
     She turns around, walks out, leaving the lights on behind
     her.
     
     We linger for a look at the video screens.  If only she'd
     done the same, she'd see what we see.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     we see the three men, still in the kitchen, huddled in a
     group, silently debating what to do.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 29
     
     Using the light that spills from the open door to the panic
     room, Meg comes back into the master bedroom and finds the
     proper door to the bathroom.
     
     INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 30
     
     Meg SNAPS the cap off a jug of Advil and dumps three into her
     palm.  She pops them in her mouth, searches for a glass for
     water, finds none, bends to the spout for a gulp to wash them
     down.
     
     She turns to the toilet.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 31
     
     On the monitor, we see the three men leave the kitchen and
     start up the stairs.
     
     INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT
     
     Meg stands, flushes the toilet.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 32
     
     One floor down, Burnham, Raoul, and Junior freeze, just
     coming up the stairs from the kitchen.  They look up, hearing
     the water rushing through the pipes in the ceiling directly
     above them.
     
     They stare at the ceiling, following with their eyes as a
     pair of feet pad across the CREAKY floor.  Finally, they hear
     a SQUEAK of bedsprings as Meg climbs back into bed.
     
     They hold a moment longer, a silence grows.  Raoul reaches
     into his jacket pocket and pulls out a ski mask.  He pulls it
     over his head.  They look at him.
     
                          RAOUL
                    (whispers)
               No face.
     
     Burnham rolls his eyes.  Doesn't know this guy much, but
     hates him so far.  They start across the foyer toward the
     stairs.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 33
     
     Meg rolls over, to go back to sleep.  She sees she's left the
     lights on in the panic room.  She TSKS, gets out of bed, and
     walks across the floor toward it.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 34
     
     Meg steps into the panic room, raises her hand to the light
     switch --
     
     -- and stops, her hand frozen in mid-air.  She cocks her
     head, looking at something she can't understand.
     
     She blinks.  Takes a step, further into the room.  She stares
     at the video monitors -- at the three men in dark clothes,
     stealing silently across the foyer.
     
     This can't be.  These are just pictures, they have no
     relation to reality.  She drops to her knees, her face inches
     from the screens, and reaches out to touch them, as if trying
     to make sure they're really there.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 35
     
     They reach the base of the stairs, Junior in the lead.  As he
     reaches a bend at the base of the stairs, he places one foot
     short on an angled step and it slips off.  He trips, falls
     forward.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 36
     
     Watching the video monitors, Meg stares in horror as the
     image of Junior slipping is verified by the SLAP of his hands
     on the stairs as he catches himself, audible through the open
     door to the panic room.
     
     She GASPS.  It is real.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 37
     
     In the living room, Burnham's eyes are wide as saucers,
     staring at Junior as he turns and pulls himself to his feet.
     
     Junior points at Raoul, speaks in an urgent whisper.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Top floor, get the little girl and
               keep her there.  I'll bring the
               woman up.  Gimme.
     
     He holds out his hand for the gun and Raoul gives it to him.
     
                          JUNIOR
                    (points to Burnham)
               Stay here.  Nobody gets past you.
     
     He heads for the stairs.  Raoul follows close behind him.
     Burnham stays, reluctant -- what the fuck has he gotten
     himself into?
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 38
     
     Meg moves.  Leaps to her feet and dashes out of the room.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 39
     
     Meg races across her bedroom, flies out the door, and bolts
     up the carpeted stairs, headed for the top floor.
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 40
     
     Meg races into Sarah's room, drops onto the bed, and grabs
     Sarah by the shoulders, trying to rouse her.
     
                          MEG
               Wake up... wake up...
     
     But she's in a profound child's sleep and won't wake up.
     
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 41
     
     One floor down, Junior and Raoul reach the third floor
     landing.  Still moving stealthily, Junior heads down the hall
     for the master bedroom, where he thinks Meg is sleeping.
     Raoul heads for the stairs that lead to the top floor.
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 42
     
     Meg is desperate, still can't wake Sarah.
     
                          MEG
               Wake up...come on, come on...
     
     She sees a plastic cup on her night table/box, half filled
     with water.  She snatches it and tosses the water in her
     face.
     
     Now she's awake.  And pissed off.  She SPUTTERS, SHOUTS.
     
                          SARAH
               WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?!
     
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 43
     
     Raoul, at the base of the stairs that lead to the top floor,
     hears the kid shouting.  He starts up the stairs, quickly.
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 44
     
     On the top floor, Meg is already dragging Sarah out of the
     room and into the hallway.
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 45
     
     Meg and Sarah come out of Sarah's bedroom just as Raoul
     reaches the top of the stairs at the other end.  They're cut
     off.
     
     Meg freezes, staring at the hulking ski-masked figure at the
     end of the hallway.  She thinks, no idea what to do for a
     second.  She looks frantically to her right -- the bathroom,
     dead end.
     
     She looks to her left.
     
     The elevator.
     
     She yanks open the elevator door, throws aside the gate, and
     races inside with Sarah.
     
     Raoul takes off down the hall, lunging for the elevator.
     
     INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT 46
     
     Meg SLAMS the gate shut and PUNCHES the button for the first
     floor.  The elevator GROANS to life and starts down --
     slowly.
     
     Sarah looks up at her, terrified.
     
                          SARAH
               What's going on?!
     
                          MEG
               People.  In the house.
     
     As the elevator descends, they see Raoul, through the window
     in the door, as he drops to his knees, to get a good look at
     them.
     
     INT.  TOP FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 47
     
     Raoul turns from the elevator, SHOUTS to the open stairwell.
     
                          RAOUL
               IN THE ELEVATOR!  BOTH OF 'EM HEADED
               TOWARD YOU!
     
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 48
     
     Junior turns from the open doorway of the master bedroom and
     races back down the hall, toward the elevator.  He reaches
     the door, peers through the window.
     
     He sees the bare feet of Meg and Sarah, dropping toward him.
     He grabs the door handle, pulls as hard as he can, but it
     stays locked, with the elevator moving beyond.
     
     He bangs on the button, hoping the elevator will stop.  As
     Meg and Sarah drop fully into view, he stands there, eye to
     moving eye with her for a moment.  But the elevator doesn't
     stop, it keeps going down.
     
     INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT 49
     
     Meg stands frozen, terrified, staring at Junior as they move
     past him.
     
     Junior has another go at the door, pulling as hard as he can,
     actually bending the door, but the elevator is still moving,
     the catch holds fast and the door won't open.
     
     As they pass, his face suddenly disappears, he takes off.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 50
     
     Junior flies down the stairs, to cut them off at the first
     floor.
     
     INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT 51
     
                          MEG
               He's going down.
     
                          SARAH
               That room!
     
                          MEG
               What?!
     
                          SARAH
               PANIC ROOM!
     
     Meg thinks, then punches the button for three, to go back up.
     
     But the elevator continues down.  She jabs at it, futilely.
     
                          SARAH
               No.  you gotta...
     
     She reaches past her, pushes the STOP button.  The elevator
     jerks to a halt.  Then Sarah pushes three.  Now the elevator
     starts to rise.
     
     Meg looks at her, impressed.  Love that kid.
     
     INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT 52
     
     In the foyer, Junior freezes, hearing the elevator stop and
     start again.
     
                          JUNIOR
               SHE'S COMING BACK UP TOWARD YOU!!
     
     He takes off up the stairs again.  Burnham can't take it
     anymore, he takes off after Junior, following him upstairs.
     
     INT.  FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 53
     
     Raoul, still on the top floor, heads for the stairs, fast.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 54
     
     Junior races back up the stairs.  They have her caught in the
     middle.
     
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 55
     
     The door to the elevator BANGS open on three, the gate
     RATTLES aside, and Meg and Sarah leap out.  They take off
     down the hall, toward the doorway to the master bedroom.
     
     Raoul flies down the stairs, not twenty feet behind them.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 56
     
     Meg and Sarah run through the master bedroom.  As she passes
     the night table, Sarah swings an open hand to grab her cell
     phone from its cradle.  But in her haste she starts to pull
     it out at an angle and the prongs at the bottom stick in the
     charger.  The phone slips from her fingers, bounces off the
     corner of the table, caroms off her foot, and skitters under
     the bed.
     
     Sarah turns, looks to the head of the stairs just as Junior
     turns the corner and Raoul thunders down the steps from four.
     
     She abandons the phone, grabs Sarah, and they lunge through
     the open doorway to the panic room.
     
     Junior and Raoul burst through the doorway to the bedroom,
     just a few steps away.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 57
     
     Meg and Sarah trip over each other coming through the
     doorway, they tumble to the floor of the panic room, the door
     wide open behind them.  Meg spins around, hurls herself at
     the red button on the wall --
     
     -- Junior leaps, sailing through the air toward them --
     
     -- Meg SLAMS her open palm on the red button, the massive
     coiled spring that holds the metal door open is released, the
     steel barrier leaps forward out of the wall --
     
     -- and WHANGS shut in a split-second.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 58
     
     Junior SLAMS into the closing metal door, banging his
     shoulder into it, and slithers to the ground, too late.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 59
     
     Meg rolls over and pulls Sarah into her arms, both of them
     breathing hard, asking each other if they're okay, scared out
     of their minds.
     
     But safe.
     
     She spots the telephone, the one with the special buried
     phone line.  She lunges for it, snatches it from its cradle,
     listens for a dial tone.
     
     Nothing there either.
     
                          MEG
               Damn it!
     
                          SARAH
               It doesn't work?!
     
                          MEG
               Different phone line, I never hooked
               it up!
     
     She hurls it down, looks back at Sarah.  She seems a bit
     pale, scared.  She goes to her, holds her, reassures her.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 60
     
     Junior is slumped at the base of the door, livid, in pain,
     pounding on it with his fists, screaming "NO!" over and over
     again, crazy with rage.
     
     Raoul stands in the middle of the room, chest heaving, hands
     on his knees.
     
     Burnham finally walks into the room and stops in the doorway,
     looks from Raoul to Junior to the door to the panic room,
     figures out the situation.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Tell me... tell me they're not in
               there...
     
     We rise up, above them, above the room, looking down on them,
     the rats-in-a-maze shot.
     
     We rise up further still, above where the ceiling ought to
     be, to look down on this room and the one beside it, the room
     behind the four inches of reinforced steel, the panic room in
     which Meg and Sarah kneel in the middle of the floor, holding
     each other tight.
     
     Standoff.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 61
     
     Very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room.  An
     ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel.
     Listens.
     
     Meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.
     
                          MEG
               Can't hear a thing.
     
                          SARAH
               What do they want?
     
                          MEG
               I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't
               know.
     
     She sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room.
     She's trying not to show how freaked out she is.
     
                          SARAH
               What do we do?
     
                          MEG
               Wait.
     
                          SARAH
               What if they get in here?
     
                          MEG
               They can't.  They can't get in here.
               No.  They can't.
     
                          SARAH
               I heard you.
     
                          MEG
               Feel okay?
     
                          SARAH
               Yeah.
     
                          MEG
               Shaky?
     
                          SARAH
               Nope.
     
                          MEG
               Chills?
     
                          SARAH
               Huh uh.
     
     She checks her wristwatch, for some reason.
     
                          SARAH
               Don't worry about me.
     
     The implications being, worry about yourself.
     
     Sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies
     them.  Meg crawls over to join her.  They scan the screens.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     there are a dozen different views of the house.  Front stoop.
     Kitchen.  Dining room.  Entry floor.  Living room.  Master
     bedroom.  Den.  Top floor bedrooms, both of them.  Top two
     floor hallways.  Even one with a shot of the inside of the
     elevator.
     
     The three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing
     in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument.  Lots of
     gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a
     word.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the
     right of the video monitors.  She slides over, studies a
     panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small
     grilled area.
     
                          MEG
               Hey...
     
     Sarah joins her, looks at the buttons.  Each one is labeled
     with a different room name -- den, kitchen, master bedroom,
     etc.  Up in the corner there is a button that says "ALL
     PAGE," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked
     "TALK."
     
     Meg looks at Sarah.
     
                          SARAH
               Go ahead.
     
     Meg is reluctant, frightened.  Sarah is encouraging, for the
     first time.
     
                          SARAH
               You can do it.
     
     Meg leans forward, clears her throat.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 62
     
     Burnham, Raoul, and Junior are standing in the half-darkened
     living room, in the middle of their argument, when a VOICE
     booms around them.
     
                          MEG (O.S.)
               Excuse me.
     
     They practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for
     the source of the voice.
     
                          MEG (O.S.)
               The police are on their way.
     
     Only Burnham has remained relatively calm.  After he gets
     over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera
     that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and
     stares up at it.  Raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is
     careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back
     to it.
     
                          MEG
               I suggest you leave.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a
     finger from side to side.  He raises a hand, makes a gesture
     like a telephone, then wags his finger again.  The message is
     clear -- you don't have a phone.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg is puzzled.
     
                          MEG
               How'd he know that?
     
     She presses the talk button again.
     
                          MEG
                    (into speaker)
               Take what you want and get out.
     
     That sounded fairly tough.  She looks at the monitor again.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then
     they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning
     in circles, looking for something.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg and Sarah watch them, confused.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Burnham holds up a finger to the camera -- wait a second --
     while Raoul and Junior rush off screen, looking for
     something.  Junior returns a moment later holding something
     and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something.
     
     After a moment, they break apart and Junior steps up to the
     camera holding a pad of paper.  He shows it to the camera.
     On the top page, in big block letters, they've written.
     
     WHAT WE WANT
     
     After a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second
     page, where four more words are written.
     
     IS IN THAT ROOM.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah GASPS, Meg sits back.
     
                          MEG
               "What we want is in that room."
     
                          SARAH
               They're coming in here, aren't they?
     
                          MEG
               No, I told you, they can't.  It's
               not a possibility.
     
     Angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.
     
                          MEG
                    (into speaker)
               What do you know about this room?
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first
     draft of a response torn up.  Finally, Junior steps forward
     with another sign:
     
     MORE THAN YOU.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it.
     She hits the talk button again.
     
                          MEG
                    (into speaker)
               We're not coming out.  We're not
               letting you in.  Get out of my
               house.
                    (clicks off)
     
                          SARAH
               Say fuck.
     
                          MEG
                    (into speaker)
               Fuck.
     
                          SARAH
               "Get the fuck out of my house."
     
                          MEG
                    (into speaker)
               Get the fuck out of my house!
     
     She clicks off again, looks to Sarah for approval, and gets
     it, sort of, in Sarah's half-smile.  But Sarah's eyes go back
     to the screen.
     
                          SARAH
               Answer.
     
     Meg follows Sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another
     message is being held up for them.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     the notepad says:
     
     WE WILL LET YOU GO.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg and Sarah speak at the same time.
     
                          MEG
               Oh, please.
     
                          SARAH
               Give me a break.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 63
     
     In the living room, her voice booms from the speaker.
     
                          MEG (O.S.)
               Conversation's over.
     
     With an audible CLICK, she signs off.  Burnham, Raoul, and
     Junior stand arrayed beneath the camera, staring up at it,
     dumbfounded.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Got her right where you want her,
               Junior.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Shut up.
     
                          BURNHAM
               When you said you'd let 'em go I
               thought she'd come running right out
               for sure.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Shut up and let me think.
     
     He opens a pack of cigarettes, takes out a joint and lights
     it.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I'm afraid to let you think, Junior.
               Things get worse when you think.
                    (sniffs)
               Oh, that's gonna help.
     
                          JUNIOR
                    (holding in a hit)
               Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are
               we gonna do?
     
                          RAOUL
               What if she called the cops?
     
                          BURNHAM
               She didn't.
     
                          JUNIOR
               She said she did.
     
                          BURNHAM
               She lied.  Cops woulda been here by
               now if she called 'em.  Besides,
               Junior cut the phones.
     
     Burnham goes to the window and stares outside.  He laughs,
     covers his face.
     
                          RAOUL
               What the fuck is funny about this?
     
                          BURNHAM
               God.
     
                          RAOUL
               There is not one thing funny here.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Who else but God could think this
               shit up?  I spend ten years building
               those fucking rooms to keep people
               out, now I gotta figure out how to
               get in.  God, man, He just loves the
               irony.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic
               and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are
               you gonna get us into that room?
     
                          BURNHAM
               Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in
               the room.
     
                          RAOUL
               So what the fuck are we supposed to
               do?!
     
                          BURNHAM
               Make her come out.  And when she
               does, that's when we gotta be
               careful.  She can't get out of this
               house.  She can't even think she can
               get out of this house.  We just keep
               them here and keep them quiet for
               forty-five minutes.  And I don't
               want
                    (Raoul)
               Joe Pesci here standing over them
               with his fat sweaty finger on the
               trigger.  That's a sure way for us
               to end up with two dead bodies and
               little puffs of smoke burning out of
               our heads up in Greenhaven.  So
               we're gonna seal the place up.  They
               wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll
               help 'em.  Make it impossible for
               them to leave.  Once they come out
               of that room.
     
                          JUNIOR
               And why exactly would they want to
               come out?
     
     At the window, Burnham notices something sitting just outside
     the French doors, on the balcony.  It's a large outdoor
     barbecue grill.  He thinks, takes a step closer.
     
     He sees a white five gallon tank of some kind underneath the
     grill.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Workin' on it.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 64
     
     In the panic room, Meg is sitting cross-legged on the floor,
     leaning against a wall, but Sarah is in motion, sorting
     through shelves, opening drawers.  Every drawer has something
     in it, sealed under plastic.  She opens and closes, sorts and
     lifts finds the following:
     
     Waterproof matches and lighters.
     
     Flashlights.
     
     Unopened packages of batteries.
     
     Sealed water bags stamped "PURE FIVE YEARS FROM DATE."
     
     Tinned food.
     
     Flares.
     
     Pillows, fireproof blankets (we know because the bags are
     stamped FIREPROOF BLANKET).
     
     A complete tool kit.
     
     As Sarah explores, she discovers something in the far wall at
     the end of the room, down on the floor at eye level.
     
     It's a small round portal, about eight inches across, with a
     four-pronged cloverlike seal.  The portal is closed tight, as
     Sarah pokes and scrapes at it idly with a finger or two, it
     resists her attempts to crank it open.
     
     Meg notices.
     
                          MEG
               Hey.  Relax, okay?
     
     But Sarah keeps at it, feels along the edges of the portal,
     then all along the wall, looking for some kind of hidden
     switch that controls it.
     
                          MEG
               I mean it, lie down.  You get your
               adrenaline up and you know what's
               gonna happen.
     
     Sarah stops, looks at her mother, who is pale and wan,
     huddled in the corner.
     
                          SARAH
               Are you freaking out?
     
                          MEG
               Little bit.  Yeah.
     
     Sarah looks around the room.
     
                          SARAH
               Small space?
     
                          MEG
                    (nods, fast)
               Don't though.
                    (talk about it, that is)
     
     Sarah looks at her, thinks.  It's not an unfamiliar
     situation, her needing to comfort her mother.
     
                          SARAH
               Why did the chicken cross the road?
     
                          MEG
               What am I, a five year old?
     
                          SARAH
               Why did the chicken cross the road?
     
                          MEG
               I don't know, why?
     
                          SARAH
               To prove he wasn't chicken.
     
     Meg tries to push a smile across her face, but it's
     immediately dashes as she looks back at the video screens.
     Her eyes show alarm, staring at the kitchen.
     
                          MEG
               What the hell are they doing?
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 65
     
     The contents of one of the satchels is dumped out over the
     kitchen counter, every kind of tool imaginable, many that are
     unfamiliar to us.  They sort through the pile, choosing
     things.
     
     INT.  KITCHEN FLOOR - REAR DOORS - NIGHT 66
     
     At the French doors that lead to the garden, Burnham has a
     cordless screwdriver and a pile of long screws in his hand.
     He reaches up, drills a screw through the door, into the
     corner of the door frame.  He does the same at the bottom of
     the door.
     
     He unlocks the doorknob, tries it.  The screws hold the door
     fast.  He moves on, to the next door.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     In the panic room, Meg stares at the video screens, eyes
     wide, terrified.  She watches them.  Can't take her eyes off
     them.
     
                          MEG
                    (barely audible)
               ... locking us in...
     
     INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT 67
     
     In the library, in the front of the house, Raoul screws shut
     a window, driving the long screws into its frame.  He looks
     out at the street, at two CLUBGOERS walking home.
     
     He pulls the drape.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 68
     
     Meg's hands are over her mouth, she's trembling, shaking her
     head from side to side.  This can't be happening.
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 69
     
     In the kitchen, Junior goes to the wall phone Meg used to
     call for pizza earlier.  He cuts the phone wire with a
     knife.
     
     He stands there, staring at the phone, wiping the sweat from
     his palms on his pants.  Not satisfied, he pulls the phone
     itself out of the wall, cuts the cord for the handset too.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 70
     
     Meg pushes herself back into the corner of the panic room,
     horrified.  Sweat has broken out on her forehead, her whole
     body seems to vibrate.  Sarah comes over, leans in front of
     her.
     
                          SARAH
               Mom?
     
     But Sarah's voice is hollow, seems far away.
     
                          SARAH
               Are you okay?
     
     Meg looks at her.  As she watches, Sarah floats away from
     her.  In fact, the entire room is floating away from her,
     elongating.
     
     And narrowing.  Meg looks to the sides, and the walls don't
     just seem like they're pushing in on her, they are pushing in
     on her.
     
     Meg opens her mouth, screams, but no sound comes out.
     
     Sarah stands up and bends over her, but now she's just a
     figure far away, all the way at the end of a long, impossibly
     narrow hall.
     
                          SARAH
                    (barely heard)
               MOM?!  MOM!!
     
     Meg crawls out, into the middle of that hallway, to get away
     from the wall, but they both continue moving in on her.
     
                          MEG
               Not here... not here... someplace
               else... someplace else...
     
     Her eyes roll back into her head, we see just the whites, and
     she loses her balance, falling over onto her back.
     
     We fall with her, move in tight on her face, and the dark
     hallway carpet beneath it turns to green, all green, grassy
     green.  She sits up, looks around, and we realize she is in
     fact somewhere else, she's --
     
     EXT.  GREAT LAWN - DAY 71
     
     -- in the middle of the Great Lawn, in Central Park.  She
     stands, turns in a circle, she's completely alone on the
     great green grassy plain in the middle of a beautiful spring
     day, tall buildings sparkling in the distance.
     
     Meg stretches her arms out, smiles, but far off in the
     distance, she hears a voice calling to her, dimly:
     
                          SARAH (O.S.)
               Mom?!  Mom!!
     
     Meg ignores the voice, she's so happy to be out here, out in
     the open, in the beautiful wide open, she could stay here
     forever, she spins around, throws her head back, but there's
     that voice again, insistent:
     
                          SARAH (O.S.)
               Mom, please!!
     
     There is the sharp sound of a SLAP, and Meg's face abruptly
     jerks to the side.  She touches her cheek, confused, as a hot
     red handprint rises up on it.
     
     What the hell was that?
     
     BAM!
     
     Now the perfect spring day is shattered suddenly by a
     deafening CRUNCH.  The smile vanishes from Meg's face, she
     turns.  Where did that come from?
     
     BAM!  Another one, even louder.  Meg's whole body winces at
     the sound.
     
     BAM!  A third one, and on this one Meg falls to her knees,
     covering her ears, walls spring up around her, right there on
     the Great Lawn, we rush in on her, the walls close in, and
     she's right back --
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 72
     
     -- in the panic room, where she always was, and that pounding
     is real, it's right outside the door, it's like somebody's
     trying to smash their way right through the wall.
     
     Sarah is right over Meg, holding her by the arms, and that
     handprint on Meg's face is real, Sarah must have slapped her
     to try to bring her out of it.
     
                          SARAH
               THEY'RE COMING IN!  THEY'RE COMING
               IN!
     
     Meg looks to the wall, watches it seem to vibrate as another
     deafening BANG crunches into it from outside.
     
     BAM!  BAM!  BAM!  The sound is deafening.  Sarah throws both
     hands over her ears.  Meg looks around, still disoriented.
     
                          SARAH
               YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK
               OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY
               HERE WITH ME!
     
                          MEG
               I am.  I'm here.
     
                          SARAH
               YOU HAVE TO!
     
                          MEG
               I'm here.  I'm here.
     
     They huddle there, terrified.  Meg blinks, wipes the sweat
     from her forehead, begins to come back around.  She turns her
     head, sneaks a look at the funny wristwatch Sarah wears,
     tries to look without her daughter knowing.  It's not an
     ordinary watch, it only has one number, a tall, flashing
     digital display:
     
     120
     
     Meg nods, as if reassuring herself.
     
                          MEG
               We're fine.  We're okay.
     
     She turns, looks at the video monitors to see what the hell
     they're doing out there.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 73
     
     BAM!
     
     In the master bedroom, a claw hammer CRUNCHES into the
     sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
     
     The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
     like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
     end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
     hole.
     
     As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
     behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
     beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
     
     But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
     reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
     the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
     tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
     duct.
     
     CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
     Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
     This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
     with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
     it into the drill.
     
     At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
     A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
     tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
     of a quarter.
     
     Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
     coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
     tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
     the air as it snakes across the room.
     
     Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
     just drilled in the air duct.
     
     RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
     connection, makes it airtight.
     
     SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
     section of the garden hose off the coil.
     He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
     gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
     up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
     the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
     block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.
     
     PROPANE
     CAUTION - FLAMMABLE
     
     Along with a number of other dire warnings.
     
     Burnham raises his hand to the knob, hesitates, doesn't
     really want to do this, but doesn't stop himself either.
     
     He spins it open.  Halfway.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Open it.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I did.
     
                          RAOUL
               He said open it.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Just sending a message.  She'll get
               the point.
     
     Gas HISSES through the spigot and into the hose.  We follow
     along the length of the hose, across the floor of the room,
     through the hole in the sheetrock, into the hole that's been
     drilled in the air duct --
     
     INSIDE THE WALL
     
     -- through the wall itself, where we see the horizontal lines
     of an air vent up ahead.  We squeeze between two of the
     horizontal lines --
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 74
     
     -- and come out in the panic room.  Three red streamers, tied
     to the air vent, flap to life as the gas HISSES into the
     panic room.
     
     Directly underneath the vent, Meg is hunched up against the
     wall, her arm around Sarah.
     
     She sniffs.
     
     Again.
     
     Sarah sniffs.
     
     They look at each other.
     
     She looks up.  Sees the streamers floating above her.
     
     She leaps to her feet, steps up onto a shelf, and stretches
     her nose toward the streamers.  Just as she does --
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 75
     
     Near the tank, Raoul shoves Burnham out of the way.
     
                          RAOUL
               We ain't playin', here.
     
     He cranks the valve handle of the grill open all the way.
     The gas pours into the hose with an audible WHOOSH.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 76
     
     Meg, at the vent, falls back, two lungfuls of propane, and
     drops to her knees on the floor.
     
                          SARAH
               What, what, what is it?!
     
                          MEG
               On the floor!  Get on the floor!
     
     Now Sarah coughs.  The gas is pouring into the room.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 77
     
     Raoul is standing guard over the tank, to make sure no one
     messes with the valve.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Look, don't be stupid...
     
     Junior has his head pressed against the door to the panic
     room, trying to hear any sounds from within.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Be quiet.
     
                          BURNHAM
               We're trying to scare them, not kill
               them!
     
                          JUNIOR
               They're coughing.
     
                          BURNHAM
               They're gonna die in there!
     
                          JUNIOR
               Nobody is gonna die, man, will you
               please have the balls to follow
               through with a good idea?  Think
               about it, what would you do if you
               were them, stay in there and choke
               to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're
               just getting them to come out for
               forty-five minutes, forty-five
               fucking minutes!  The worst that's
               gonna happen is they pass out, we
               drag 'em out here into the fresh
               air, and they'll be fine.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are
               we supposed to get into the room if
               they pass out?
     
     Pause.  Junior turns to Raoul.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Cut it back a little bit.
     
                          RAOUL
               No fucking way.
     
                          JUNIOR
               He's right, we can't get into the
               room if they're dead!
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 78
     
     Meg and Sarah are down on the floor, rags covering their
     mouths, trying like crazy to filter the air, but it's not
     working.  Sarah is crawling around the base of the wall, near
     to where she was before, clawing at the strange portal thing
     again.
     
     Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
     clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
     
     The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
     tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
     directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
     down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at
     the opposite end, but she can see and smell the outside
     through it.
     
     She sits up, gestures to her mother to bend down next to her.
     She does, and they both jam their mouths up near the end of
     the tube, gulping fresh air greedily.
     
     Meg looks at Sarah, good job, and they both drop to the floor
     at the portal and suck air.  It's temporary, but it works.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 79
     
     In the master bedroom, the debate has turned physical.
     Burnham lunges across the room at Raoul, to get his hands on
     the valve, to turn off the gas.  But Raoul catches him and
     hurls him aside.
     
     Burnham SLAMS into the wall, bounces off and SCREAMS at
     Raoul, who SCREAMS right back.  Junior leaps into the middle,
     trying to break it up, to get them to shut up, keep their
     voices down.
     
     It's bedlam.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 80
     
     In the panic room, Meg knows this can't go on forever.  She
     turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the
     streamers still stream.
     
     She looks to the other side of the room, to where Sarah found
     the waterproof matches and lighters.
     
     She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
     and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
     up a screwdriver.
     
     Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,
     but can't believe it.  She shakes her head vehemently.
     
     In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
     blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
     disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
     air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
     
     She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
     shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the
     vent.  Holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas,
     she unscrews the vent cover.
     
     The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
     past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the
     wall.  She reaches all the way in, lighter in hand.
     
     INSIDE THE DUCT,
     
     we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her
     fingers.  She raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it
     once.
     
     Too slow.  Not even a spark.
     
     Her hand shakes.  She tries again.  Still no spark.  But with
     the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it
     makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the
     duct with a hollow BOOM.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 81
     
     Burnham turns abruptly.
     
     He turns around.  They all freeze, listening.  He hears it
     again.  The hollow BOOM, coming from inside the wall.  Now a
     third time.
     
     He walks forward, slowly, toward the wall.
     
     BOOM.
     
     He moves closer, gets right up next to the wall.  He leans
     into the wall, putting his ear right up next to the air duct.
     This close, he hears the sound in more detail, realizes it's
     two sounds.
     
     SCRATCH.  BOOM.
     
     He arches an eyebrow.
     
     INSIDE THE DUCT,
     
     Meg's hand is trembling, tiring.  She tries again, thumbs the
     flint wheel.  It SCRATCHES as it rolls, her hand twitches,
     BOOMS against the side of the duct.
     
     Still, the gas HISSES through.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg's face is turning color, she's running out of air.  Her
     feet tremble on the shelf, she's about to lose her footing.
     
     INSIDE THE DUCT,
     
     she tries again.  SCRATCH.  BOOM.
     
     IN THE BEDROOM,
     
     Burnham's eyes suddenly pop wide as he identifies the sound.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Oh.
     
     He tears himself away from the wall --
     
     INSIDE THE DUCT,
     
     -- Meg's thumb tenses for one good hard turn --
     
     IN THE BEDROOM,
     
     -- Burnham leaps through the air, hurling himself toward the
     propane tank --
     
     INSIDE THE DUCT,
     
     -- Meg cranks the wheel, a spark sparks, a flame flames, and
     a hot blue cloud shoots out in two directions, one toward the
     panic room, the other toward the bedroom.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg jumps off the shelf, throwing herself as far away from
     the vent as she can, her arm engulfed by licking blue flame.
     She drops to the floor of the room, covering her daughter's
     body just as the entire ceiling of the panic room turns into
     a lake of fire with a deafening WHOOMP.  The fluorescent
     light tubes EXPLODE, showering glass everywhere.
     
     IN THE BEDROOM,
     
     the blue flame shoots out of the wall, into the hose, through
     the hose, backing up toward the tank.
     
     Burnham CRUNCHES to the floor next to the tank, knocking the
     other end of the hose away from the spigot just as the blue
     flame erupts from the end of the hose.
     
     The flame engulfs his entire body, his hair starts on fire,
     his chest, his arms.  Raoul lunges forward, Junior tears the
     blankets from the bed and throws them over him, Burnham HOWLS
     and rolls on the floor in pain.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
     another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
     that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
     of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
     flickering, uneven light on the room.
     
     She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
     breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
     no sense whatsoever.
     
     She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
     admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
     
     Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
     off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
     shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
     
     Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Out in the bedroom, it's worse for Burnham, who has lost most
     of his hair and shirt.  But his skin isn't badly burned,
     which is something, I guess.
     
     Still, he's in a rage.  He POUNDS the metal door of the panic
     room.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I'M COMING IN THERE, BITCH, I AM
               COMING IN THERE!  I AM COMING IN
               THERE!
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 82
     
     Meg whirls, goes to the door herself, SCREAMS right back.  We
     can hardly make out a word she's saying, but it sounds
     threatening.
     
     Suddenly, she stops, hearing something else.  Outside the
     door, Burnham continues to rant, but there's a second sound,
     a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
     that's shared with the brownstone next door.
     
     It's a faint -- very faint -- POUNDING sound, along with a
     high pitched, complaining voice, so faint it can hardly be
     heard.  Sarah hears it too.
     
                          SARAH
               Neighbor!
     
     Meg and Sarah leap as one, facing the common wall, SHOUTING
     at the tops of their lungs -- get help, call the police,
     please, call the police, that sort of thing.
     
     They shout and shout, but the soft pounding continues, and if
     their voices are as soft on the other side as the COMPLAINING
     VOICE is on this side, they have no hope.
     
     Their voices crack and they begin to cough, too irritated by
     the gas to shout for very long.  Long after they stop, the
     soft POUNDING from next door continues.
     
     Their pleas are not heard.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 83
     
     The Intruders have stopped their racket too, and are
     listening carefully at the common wall.  Eventually, the soft
     POUNDING stops, the complaining voice complains no more.
     
     Burnham stands there, in pain.  Things are falling apart.
     Raoul stands in the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway
     light.  He draws himself up to his full, bulky height.  He's
     big.
     
                          RAOUL
                    (to Junior)
               We're gonna talk.  Downstairs.
     
     Junior nods and starts out.  Raoul lets him pass, but when
     Burnham tries to follow him, Raoul puts a big hand on his
     chest stopping him.
     
                          RAOUL
               You stay.  Make sure she don't come
               out.
     
     Burnham swallows.  But stays.
     
     Raoul turns, follows Junior downstairs.  As he descends, he
     looks up, making eye contact with Burnham.  And holding it.
     Something on his mind, that's for sure.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 84
     
     THUNK.  Meg's head falls back against a wall; she sags to the
     floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
     
     But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
     rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
     forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
     and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
     around the room.
     
     Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
     flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
     
     Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
     discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
     brownstone.
     
     About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
     brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
     the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
     see straight into somebody's bedroom.
     
     There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
     on his chest.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah sits back.
     
     She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
     top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
     Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
     wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
     the tube.
     
     Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
     shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
     enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
     Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
     her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
     
     Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
     the top of the flashlight.
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
     courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
     The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
     
     The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.
     Long.  Long.  Short.  Short.  Short.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg turns to Sarah, impressed.
     
                          MEG
               Morse code?
     
                          SARAH
                    (nods)
               Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
               dot.
     
                          MEG
               Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
     
                          SARAH
               "Titanic."
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     the flashes continue -- dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot
     dot.  But the Man continues to sleep, the light on the wall
     behind him has no effect.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
     shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
     starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
     watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:
     
     114
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     the Sleeping Man stirs.  Opens his eyes.  Winces from the
     light, which is flashing directly in his eyes.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
                          MEG
               Got him!
     
                          SARAH
               Come on, come on...
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     the Sleeping Man sits up.  Raises a hand, trying to block the
     light, which keeps flashing on him.
     
     He gets up, out of bed.  He comes to the window.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
                          MEG
               Yes, yes, yes, yes...
     
     Sarah keeps it up, flashing faster.
     
     THROUGH THE TUBE,
     
     they see the Man come all the way to his window.  He leans
     against it, cups his hands so he can see better.  The flashes
     continue, right on top of him now.
     
     Clearly, the Man is reading the flashes!  He takes a steps
     back from the window --
     
     -- gives them the finger --
     
     -- and angrily yanks shut his drapes.
     
     A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg and Sarah drop their heads to the carpet, defeated.
     
     Sarah rolls over, knocks the flashlight away, stares up at
     the ceiling.
     
     Meg puts a hand in her hair.  It was a good idea.
     
                          SARAH
               We're never getting out of here.
     
                          MEG
               Shhh...
     
     She looks at the wristwatch again.
     
     103
     
     She's concerned.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 85
     
     Burnham is concerned as well.  He's still in the master
     bedroom, but barely, he's standing in the doorway, straining
     like hell to hear a conversation that Junior and Raoul are
     having in the foyer, one floor one.
     
     They're trying to keep their voices down, but stray words
     float up through the open stairwell -- words like "him" and
     "warning" and "dangerous."
     
     Burnham chews a fingernail.  If only he could get closer.  He
     throws a look back at the door to the panic room.  He looks
     back out the bedroom door.  Listening.
     
     INT.  FOYER - NIGHT 86
     
     Junior and Raoul are huddled together in the foyer.  They're
     keeping their voices low, but their conversation is heated.
     
                          JUNIOR
               We're not gonna do anything about
               him, he's fine.
     
                          RAOUL
               If you think I'm gonna let my half
               of the fourteen million bucks slip
               away because of --
     
                          JUNIOR
               "Half?"  What did you, take a nap in
               math class?  Three people, three
               shares, one third.  Four point six
               six six repeating.
     
                          RAOUL
               I'm just saying, the man is a
               problem.  And he's your problem.
               Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
     
                          JUNIOR
               That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your
               idea, none of this was your idea, it
               was mine, it's my family we're
               ripping off, it's my prick
               grandfather who built that fucking
               room, it was my idea to get the
               plans, I found the floor safe, and
               it was my idea to ask a guy who
               builds these rooms to help break
               into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at
               no point did I say "you" or Raoul,"
               got it?
     
                          RAOUL
               He puts his hands on me again I'll
               bury a slug in his ear.
     
                          JUNIOR
               No, you will not, because without
               Burnham there's no way in hell we're
               gonna get into that safe, so as far
               as I'm concerned he can paint your
               ass blue and run it up a flagpole
               and you won't lay a finger on him,
               you understand me?
     
                          RAOUL
               Don't take no tone of voice with me,
               Homes.
     
                          JUNIOR
               What is this shit you're talking all
               of a sudden?  You're a bus driver,
               "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so
               please don't start spouting some
               Elmore Leonard shit you just heard
               because I saw that movie too,
     
     ON THE VIDEO MONITORS,
     
     Junior and Raoul are visible, still arguing in the foyer.
     
     On the next monitor over, Burnham is visible, standing in the
     master bedroom doorway, listening.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg is watching the monitors, thinking.  She notices
     something, sits forward abruptly, looking at the monitor that
     covers the master bedroom.  She squeezes right up close,
     staring at the screen.
     
     ON THE MONITOR,
     
     we peer closely at the box next to her bed, the one she was
     using for a night table.  On top of the box, she sees the
     charger for her cellular phone, sitting empty.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg sits back, eyes alive with an idea.  If only she could
     get to that phone, which must be still under the bed.  She
     looks back at the monitors, at Burnham lingering in the
     doorway to the room.
     
                          MEG
               Damn.
     
     She turns away from the monitors, to check on Sarah, who's
     settled into a corner of the room, looking pale.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 87
     
     In the bedroom, Burnham is desperate.  The argument
     downstairs is entering round two, and he's got to hear what
     they're saying.
     
     He takes a few steps out of the bedroom --
     
     INT.  THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 88
     
     -- and comes into the hallway.  He leans over the stairwell.
     Where he's standing, he is directly under the camera that
     covers the hallway --
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     -- and can't be seen on the monitor that covers the hallway.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg turns back from Sarah, to look at the monitors again.
     She see Burnham is no longer in the bedroom.  And doesn't
     appear to be in the hallway, either.
     
                          MEG
               Oh yes, yes...
     
     She looks at another monitor.
     
     ON THE MONITOR,
     
     she sees Junior and Raoul in the foyer.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg sits back.  That leaves Burnham unaccounted for.
     
                          MEG
               ... the hell is he?
     
     IN THE HALLWAY,
     
     Burnham is still lingering under the camera.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah has come forward to the monitors as well.
     
                          SARAH
               Do it.
     
                          MEG
               Yeah, but where's the third guy?
     
                          SARAH
               Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
     
     Meg goes to the door, raises a hand to the green "open"
     button.  Hesitates.
     
     IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
     
     we see Burnham, lurking in the hallway, just about six feet
     from the door to the panic room.  Don't open that door!
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg wipes sweat from her palm.
     
                          MEG
               If it looks like I can't get back,
               just close the door.
     
                          SARAH
               No.
     
                          MEG
               Close it!
     
     Sarah nods, looks back to the button.
     
     IN THE HALLWAY,
     
     a shouted CURSE rises up from downstairs.  Burnham takes a
     step toward the stairs.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     he suddenly appears, in the hallway.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah sees it.
     
                          SARAH
               WAIT!
     
     Meg freezes.  She looks at the monitor, wide-eyed.  Close
     one.
     
     IN THE HALLWAY,
     
     Burnham can't take it anymore.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Oh, hell...
     
     He turns and takes off down the stairs.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Burnham flies down the stairs and appears in the foyer, next
     to Junior and Raoul.   
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg and Sarah see all three men accounted for, downstairs.
     
                          SARAH
               GO GO GO!
     
     Meg leaps up, runs to the door, and punches the green button.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 89
     
     The door begins to crank open, Meg slips through the gap
     sideways before it's even all the way open.  She darts across
     the room --
     
     -- slides to the floor next to the bed --
     
     -- and flattens herself, reaching underneath it to get the
     phone.  Damn, that phone slid far, it's right in the middle,
     wouldn't you know it.
     
     IN THE FOYER,
     
     the three men hear her footsteps, as one, they take off for
     the stairs.
     
     IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
     
     Meg continues to stretch, her fingers inches from the phone.
     
     ON THE STAIRWELL,
     
     feet race up toward her --
     
     IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
     
     Meg's fingernails paw the phone, pull it closer to her.  She
     grabs it, stands --
     
     IN THE HALLWAY,
     
     the three men come off the stairs and race toward her, they
     see her as she lunges across, toward the panic room, she
     hurls herself through the door --
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     -- and Sarah SMACKS the red button.  The steel door closes
     with a deafening WHANG.
     
     Safe.
     
     IN THE ENTRYWAY,
     
     the echo of the metallic WHANG reverberates through the
     house.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 90
     
     In the panic room, Meg punches 9-1-1 on her cell phone with
     trembling fingers.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 91
     
     The big empty charger cradle is in the foreground when the
     three men burst into the room.  Burnham stops in the middle
     of the floor, turns in a frantic circle.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What'd she get, what'd she get,
               what'd she get...
     
     His eyes fall on the empty charger.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Cell phone.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Shit!
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 92
     
     Meg raises the cell phone to her ear --
     
     -- and gets a rapid busy signal.
     
                          MEG
               Oh, no.  No, no, no no no no no...
     
     She looks at the phone.  It's showing just one signal bar,
     and even that one is flashing on and off.
     
                          MEG
               Oh come on, come on, come on...
     
     She walks around the room, raises the phone high and low,
     trying crazily to find a signal.
     
     But can't.   
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 93
     
     In the bedroom, Burnham stands just outside the door,
     fingertips lightly resting on it, the ghost of a smile on his
     face.
     
                          BURNHAM
                    (softly)
               I don't think we'll be talking on
               our cell phone from in there...
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 94
     
     Inside the room, Meg doesn't seem upset.  Rather, she's
     staring at the cell phone in her hand, thinking.  Remembering
     something.
     
                          MEG
               Wires...
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 95
     
     At the same moment, Burnham is having the same thought.  He's
     still at the door, fingertips still resting there.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Phone...
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 96
     
                          MEG
               ... wires.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 97
     
     Burnham looks down, at the baseboard below.  What is he
     looking at?
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 98
     
     Meg steps up, onto the shelf she climbed earlier, and comes
     up next to the vent.
     
                          SARAH
               What are you doing?
     
                          MEG
               I saw something, I saw...
     
     In the vent, alongside the duct, she sees the bundle of
     multicolored wires she saw earlier.
     
                          MEG
               ... phone wires!
     
     She jumps down off the shelf, goes to the tools, starts
     searching for something.
     
                          MEG
               I may not have hooked up the phone
               in here, but I hooked up the main
               line, and there's a jack at the base
               of this wall outside, I saw it!
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 99
     
     Yes, that is correct, there is in fact a jack in the base of
     the wall outside the door to the panic room.
     
     Burnham bends down into frame, studying it, thinking the same
     thing she is.  He clears his throat.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Say, while we're on the subject of
               phones...
     
     He turns, looks up at Junior.
     
                          BURNHAM
               When I said cut the line, did you
               cut the main line at the junction
               box in the basement like I said, and
               which I repeated, or did you just
               cut the cord on the phone in the
               kitchen?
     
     Pause.  Swallow.
     
                          JUNIOR
               I, uh, I...
     
     Shit.
     
                          JUNIOR
               ... hit a little snag finding the
               one in the basement.
     
     Shit.
     
     Pause.  Then, as if a starting gun has been fired, Burnham
     leaps to his feet and races out of the bedroom.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 100
     
     That same starting gun has been fired in the panic room.
     With a strong RIP, Meg pulls the whole bundle of multi
     colored wires out of the wall and drops onto the floor with
     it.  She trusts it at Sarah, finds a wire cutter in the
     assorted tools, and gives her that too.
     
                          MEG
               Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue
               first, blue is phones!
     
                          SARAH
               Blue is phones?
     
                          MEG
               Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
     
     While Sarah goes to work on the wires, Meg turns to the phone
     itself, the one with the buried phone line that isn't working
     yet.  She rips the phone out of its housing, tears free the
     wire on the end of it.
     
     INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT 101
     
     Burnham flies down the stairs from the third floor, races
     across the foyer, flies down the stairs to the kitchen floor.
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 102
     
     Burnham races across the kitchen floor, whips open a door and
     heads down another, narrow, darkened stairway.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 103
     
     Meg and Sarah are like animals, clawing and tearing at the
     ends of their respective phone cables, foregoing tools and
     stripping the wires with fingers and teeth, it's faster.
     
     With the phone receiver cradled on her shoulder, Meg starts
     twisting the ends of wires onto the exposed ends of the wires
     from the phone unit.  First wire -- nothing.  She tries a
     second wire.
     
     INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT 104
     
     Burnham SLAMS open the door to a dark room, pulls the string
     on a bare bulb.  Burned out.
     
                          BURNHAM
               God damn it!
     
     Without light, he can't see a thing.  He SMACKS the bulb, it
     swings wildly, SMASHES on the cement wall.  He turns and
     races out of the room.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 105
     
     Meg tries another wire.  Still no dial tone.  Sarah shoves
     another wire at her.  She tries again.  Nothing.  She moves
     on.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 106
     
     Burnham slides to his knees, snatches a flashlight from his
     duffel, leaps up and takes off again.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 107
     
     Another wire.  Nothing.  Another wire.  DIAL TONE!
     
     Meg SHRIEKS and punches 911.
     
     INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 108
     
     Burnham flies down the stairs, flashlight beam bouncing
     crazily in front of him.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 109
     
     The phone is ringing.  An operator picks up.
     
                          OPERATOR
               911 emergency --
     
                          MEG
               I'm at 26 West --
     
                          OPERATOR
               -- please hold.
     
     It's a mechanical voice, which gives over to MUZAK.
     
                          MEG
               NO!
     
     INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT 110
     
     Burnham BANGS through the door again, starts searching the
     darkened mechanical room, shining harsh light around its
     dingy walls.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 111
     
     MUZAK continues to play.
     
                          MEG
               Damn it!
     
     No more time to hold.  Meg hangs up the phone, dials another
     number, a seven digit one she knows by heart.
     
                          SARAH
               Call Dad!
     
                          MEG
               On it!
     
     INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT 112
     
     In the mechanical room, the bouncing flashlight beam falls on
     a metal cabinet across the way.  Burnham runs to it, flings
     it open.  Circuit breakers.  SLAMS it shut.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 113
     
     Meg listens as a phone rings on the other end.  And rings.
     And rings again.
     
     This is torture.
     
     INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT 114
     
     Burnham turns, sees another, smaller metal box, this one
     clearly labeled:
     
     PHONES
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 115
     
     On the other end of the phone, a husky MALE VOICE answers;
     clearly he's been awakened.
     
                          VOICE
               Hello?
     
                          MEG
               Listen to me!  There are three --
     
     INT.  MECHANICAL ROOM - NIGHT 116
     
     With a subhuman ROAR of anger, Burnham rips the entire phone
     panel off the wall with his bare hands.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 117
     
     With an abrupt SHRIEK, the line goes dead.  Meg pauses, can't
     believe it.
     
                          MEG
               Hello?  Don't... are...
     
     She looks up, see Sarah looking at her, her eyebrows arches,
     her face all hope.  Meg keeps her cool, but it take a hell of
     an effort.
     
     Sarah reads her face.  She turns away.
     
     She hangs up the phone.
     
     Sarah goes to a corner of the room, faces away from her.
     
     Meg doesn't know what to say.
     
                          MEG
               He'll do something.
     
                          SARAH
               Uh uh.
     
                          MEG
               He'll know we're in trouble.  He
               heard me, I said "There are
               three..."
     
                          SARAH
               He won't even know who it was.
     
                          MEG
               What would you think, in the middle
               of the night?  I mean, three what,
               three bears?  He'll call the police.
     
                          SARAH
               Stop it.
     
                          MEG
               He's just across the park, this is
               why we got places so close to each
               other, in case we needed each other,
               we're still a family, he'll help
               us...
     
                          SARAH
               He --
     
                          MEG
               He WILL.
     
     She practically shouted.  Sarah drop her head into her arms.
     
                          MEG
               I'm sorry.
     
                          SARAH
               I'm sorry.
     
                          MEG
               Why?
     
                          SARAH
               I was trying not to tell you...
     
                          MEG
               What?
     
                          SARAH
               I'm dizzy and thirsty.
     
     Meg blanches.  This is very bad news.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 118
     
     Tired, Burnham drags himself back up the stairs and into the
     doorway of the master bedroom.  Raoul and Junior stand there,
     staring at him.
     
     Long pause.
     
                          JUNIOR
               She's never coming out.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Hey.
     
                          JUNIOR
               And we're never getting in.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Do me a favor and don't talk.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Jesus, what was I thinking?
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 119
     
     Meg has torn open one of the water packets and is trying to
     get Sarah to drink, but the little girl has gone completely
     pale and seems to have lost some of the strength in her neck,
     she's having trouble holding her head up.  Most of the water
     runs down her chin.
     
                          MEG
               Come on, come on... stay with me...
               you gotta drink...
     
     She takes Sarah's hand, checks her wristwatch thing.  The
     readout is now
     
     82
     
     She swallows.  She grabs Sarah by the face.
     
                          MEG
               Okay, listen, honey, you went double
               digit here, you must have been
               shooting out adrenaline like crazy,
               we gotta bring your blood sugar back
               up, okay?  Can you hear me?
     
                          SARAH
               I'm dizzy, not deaf.
     
                          MEG
               Hey, she's still a smart ass,
               excellent sign.  Did you see any
               sugar in here?  Any candy bars,
               anything sweet?
     
                          SARAH
               Huh uh.
     
                          MEG
               Okay, you just gotta calm yourself
               down, that's all, just stay calm and
               your adrenaline will go back to
               normal and you'll be fine.
     
                          SARAH
               What if I keep dropping?
     
                          MEG
               Not an option.
     
                          SARAH
               What if I do?
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 120
     
     In the bedroom, Junior has had enough.
     
                          JUNIOR
               We're leaving.
     
                          RAOUL
               The hell we are.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Hey man, after all we went through I
               am not walking out when we're this
               close.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Close?  Are you insane?  We're
               nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll
               make an anonymous phone call on
               Monday, they'll find the floor safe,
               and I'll inherit the shit.  Little
               piece of it, anyway, it's better
               than nothing.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What about us?
     
     Junior thinks, then pulls out his wallet.  He thrusts a
     fistful of bills at them.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Here.  For your time.
     
     They both just stare at him.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Five hundred bucks here.
     
     Neither one of them moves to take it.  Junior shurgs, drops
     it on the floor.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Suit yourself.
     
                          RAOUL
               Nobody leaves.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Observe.
     
     He heads for the door, expecting Raoul to block him, but as
     he draws close --
     
     -- Raoul just steps out of the way.  Junior passes through
     and heads for the stairs.
     
                          BURNHAM
               We're not leaving.  I'm getting in
               that room, and I'm opening that
               safe.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but
               ten out of ten for attitude.
     
     And he disappears, down the stairs, Burnham still pleading
     with him.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 121
     
     Meg rifles the foodstuffs that are stored in the room.
     Sarah, in the corner, is starting to tremble.
     
                          SARAH
               What if I spazz out?
     
                          MEG
                    (forced calm)
               No biggie, we've been through it a
               dozen times, I just jab you with the
               Glucogen.
     
     Pause.  She keeps looking.
     
                          SARAH
               Where is the Glucogen?
     
                          MEG
               Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the
               little fridge in your room.
     
                          SARAH
                    (pause)
               I'm sorry, Mom.
     
                          MEG
               Hey, quit apologizing, you're
               starting to sound like Grandma.
               You're not gonna have an attack.
               Okay?
     
                          SARAH
               Okay.   
     
     She lays back, oddly passive, her lips changing color.  She
     stares at the monitors.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 122
     
     Junior strides into the living room, purposefully.  He tosses
     some tools into his duffel bag and heads for the stairs down
     to the kitchen.  Burnham is behind him.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Would you wait?  Would you please
               just wait a minute?
     
     But Junior heads down.  Burnham follows.  Raoul is just
     coming down from upstairs.
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 123
     
     Junior reaches the door of the kitchen, tries to open it,
     realizes it's screwed shut.  He takes out a screwdriver and
     starts unscrewing the screws.  Burnham stops at the stairway.
     
                          BURNHAM
               You walk out that door and you lose
               your share of the money.
     
                          JUNIOR
               Yeah, whatever.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I mean it!
     
                          JUNIOR
               Adios.
     
     He gets the last screw out, throws open the door, and BLAST
     of wind gusts in, it's a blustery night out there, he takes a
     step into the doorway --
     
     -- and with a quiet PFFFT from right behind Burnham, a bullet
     whizzes across the kitchen and hits Junior in the back of the
     head.  He crumples, right in the open kitchen doorway.
     
     Burnham SHOUTS incoherently and turns.  Raoul is standing
     there, two steps up, a silencer twisted onto the barrel of
     his gun.
     
                          RAOUL
               Nobody leaves.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 124
     
     Sarah is staring at the video monitors, eyes wide.  She
     raises one trembling finger, points at the kitchen monitor,
     tries to mouth the words, can't.
     
     Meg looks up.
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 125
     
     Burnham is freaking out, but trying to stay calm.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Oh God... oh, my God...
     
     Raoul walks past him calmly, grabs Junior by the ankles, and
     drags him back into the house.  He turns, looks at Burnham,
     whose jaw is dropped in horror.
     
                          RAOUL
               You should see the look on your
               face.
     
                          BURNHAM
               The fuck did you do that for?!
     
                          RAOUL
               Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me.
               Drives his German car up to 125th
               Street a couple of times, buys a few
               rounds, thinks he's a tough guy,
               thinks he knows me.
                    (to the corpse)
               You don't know one thing about me!
     
     While Burnham stares down at the body in shock and Raoul
     stares at Burnham, his back to the outside, a small, thin
     VOICE comes from the still-open doorway.
     
                          VOICE
               What the h --
     
     They turn.  A man, fiftyish, stands there in hastily thrown
     on clothes, staring down at the dead body in mute shock.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 126
     
     Meg, watching the monitors with Sarah, GASPS as she sees the
     man, whose name is HARRIS.  While she and Sarah watch --
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     -- they see the silent image of Harris, set upon by Raoul,
     who grabs him roughly and drags him inside.  Burnham hurries
     to the door --
     
     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 127
     
     -- and SLAMS it shut.  He puts his back to it, thinking,
     terrified, things are spinning out of control, fast.
     
     Raoul, in the middle of the kitchen floor, is venting some
     more of his rage on Harris, whom he has hurled to the floor.
     He lands a solid boot in the side of Harris's head, leaving
     him GROANING in pain, completely disoriented.
     
     Harris rolls groggily into the spreading pool of blood coming
     from underneath Junior.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Stop it!  Stop it!
     
                          RAOUL
                    (turning on him)
               Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's
               the fucking clown now?!
     
     He pulls his gun, shoves it into Burnham's eye, hard, we can
     hear the faint SIZZLE of skin burning.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Me.  I am.
     
                          RAOUL
               That's right.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Burning me.  It's burning my eye.
     
                          RAOUL
               I have the gun.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yes.
     
                          RAOUL
               Remember that.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Please...
     
     Raoul pulls the gun back, just an inch.  The skin around
     Burnham's eye is an angry red.  His eyes dart, strain to look
     over at Harris, MOANING on the floor.  And at Junior, dead.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What?  What do you want me to do?
     
                          RAOUL
               What do you think?  Get us into that
               room.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I can't.
     
     Raoul pushes the gun barrel back into Burnham's eye socket.
     
                          RAOUL
               You can.  You're full of ideas.  You
               just need to squeeze one out.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I can't...
     
                          RAOUL
               You got till the count of three.
               Then you end up like him.
     
     He tilts his head over to Junior, whose brains are spreading
     out on the kitchen floor.
     
                          RAOUL
               One.  Squeeze.
     
                          BURNHAM
               This is ridiculous...
     
                          RAOUL
               Two.  Squeeze harder.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I can't just...
     
                          RAOUL
               Th --
     
                          BURNHAM
               Okay, okay!  Okay.
     
                          RAOUL
               You got an idea?
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta
               check something.
     
     Raoul GRUNTS, satisfied.  Pulls the gun back.  Burnham slides
     away, shaking.  He bends down, to the floor.  He looks at
     Harris's left hand.  At his index finger.
     
     He sees a white strip of skin, where Harris wore his wedding
     ring, until recently.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 128
     
     Harris, still semi-conscious, is hurled against the metal
     door of the panic room.  He collapses at its base.  Burnham,
     bends down next to him.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Okay, look.  I know you can hear me.
               Your wife and kid are in there.
               You're gonna get 'em to come out.
               Or --
     
     He looks up at Raoul, hulking overhead, gun in hand.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Or I can't stop what he's gonna do.
               Do you understand?
     
     Harris, regaining some semblance of consciousness, nods
     feebly.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Good.
     
     Burnham stands up, turns to the video camera, and SHOUTS.
     
                          BURNHAM
               OPEN THE GOD DAMN DOOR!
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 129
     
     Sarah and Meg see the horrifying sight on the video monitors.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 130
     
     Burnham SHOUTS at the door to the room.
     
                          BURNHAM
               OPEN UP!
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     they see Burnham, standing over Harris; they faintly hear him
     call to them to open the door.
     
     And then they hear another VOICE, calling back to them.
     Sarah sits up, recognizes her father's voice.
     
                          SARAH (O.S.)
               DADDY!
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 131
     
     Harris is SHOUTING against the closed door.
     
                          HARRIS
               DON'T DO IT!  NO MATTER WHAT
               HAPPENS, DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
               DON'T O --
     
     He's silenced by a vicious kick to the ribs.  Raoul begins to
     beat him.
     
     Burnham stands by, powerless, horrifies, watching as Raoul
     savages Harris, who continues to call out, as long as he has
     strength, telling Meg not to open the door, no matter what.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 132
     
     Meg and Sarah SHOUT in horror, she covers her daughter's
     face, turn her away from the screen, SCREAMS in incoherent
     anger of her own.
     
     But she doesn't open the door.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 133
     
     Burnham SHOUTS at Raoul, pleading.
     
                          BURNHAM
               STOP IT, MAN, STOP IT, THAT'S HIS
               KID IN THERE, HIS KID IS WATCHING
               THIS!!
     
     But Raoul whips the gun up, into Burnham's throat, backing
     him off, shutting him up.
     
     He resumes his pounding of Harris.
     
     Burnham turns, looks up at the camera in the corner of the
     room.
     
     He can't stand it anymore.  He whips off his jacket, runs to
     the camera, and covers the lens.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 134
     
     While Meg watches, the monitor that cover the master bedroom
     abruptly goes black, mercifully sparing them the sight of
     Harris's beating.
     
     She holds Sarah, who's sobbing, shaking.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 135
     
     Harris finally lapses into unconsciousness.  Raoul stands
     over him, chest heaving.
     
     Burnham stand in the doorway, neither in nor out of the room,
     a silhouette, head hung.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT 136
     
     Meg tries desperately to see something on the bedroom
     monitor, but it's hopeless, it's covered.  On the hallway
     monitor, she can just see shadows, as two men in the bedroom
     lift a third off the floor and carry him across the room.
     
     A sudden BEEPING sound tears her attention away.  Still
     holding Sarah, she pulls her back, off her shoulder.  Her
     face is completely white, her lips blue, her eyes rolled back
     into her head.  The BEEPING sound grows louder, she checks
     Sarah's wristwatch, the reading is dire:
     
     57
     
     Meg GASPS, horrifies.
     
                          MEG
               Oh God, oh my God...
     
     Sarah begins to convulse, she bucks right out of Meg's arms
     and falls back onto the floor of the panic room.  Meg clears
     everything away from her, tries to make room for her.
     
     The convulsion worsens.  Meg searches through the piles of
     supplies, comes up with a plastic-handled screwdriver.  She
     opens Sarah's jaws, wedges the plastic handle between her
     teeth.
     
     She helps Sarah ride out the convulsion.  Finally, her eyes
     roll back into her head, she slowly re-orients herself.
     Sarah reaches over, turns off her still-BEEPING
     wristwatch/monitor herself.
     
     Sarah sighs, a shuddering sigh of relief, but she is nowhere
     near normal.
     
     Her skin has passed through white and is turning a sallow
     yellow color.  She moves her lips, Meg can't hear her, she
     bends down:
     
                          SARAH
               You gotta jab me, Mommy...
     
     Meg turns, looks back at the monitors.  What she sees is good
     news --
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     the jacket has been removed from the bedroom camera.  Burnham
     and Raoul are gone, the only person there is HARRIS, who lies
     slumped on the far side of the bed.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg looks quickly over at the monitor for the living room.
     
     ON THAT MONITOR,
     
     she sees Burnham and Raoul having an urgent conversation,
     Burnham sitting in a chair, Raoul pacing in front of him,
     ranting.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Meg's face lights up, she practically laughs, she's so
     overjoyed at this turn of events.
     
     She turns, looks back at Sarah, who is starting to tremble
     again.
     
     That does it.  Meg leaps up, hits the button that controls
     the steel door, and it starts to crank open, almost
     impossibly slowly.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 137
     
     Meg steps out of the panic room, into the master bedroom.
     She looks at Harris, on the bed.  With his back to her she
     can't even tell if he's alive or dead, but first things must
     be first, so she turns and races out of the room.
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 138
     
     Meg flies up the stairs, bare feet on padded carpet.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 139
     
     In the living room, Raoul looks up, hearing the pitter-pat of
     her feet on the stairs above.
     
     He smiles and pulls his ski mask back on, to cover his face.
     
     Coming around behind him, we see Burnham sitting in the
     chair.  Except it isn't Burnham at all, it's Harris,
     unconscious, wearing Burnham's shirt.
     
     And if Harris is the person in the chair, that means --
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 140
     
     -- the person on the bed in the bedroom is Burnham, wearing
     Harris's shirt.  His eyes pop open, he sits up, sees the wide
     open door to the panic room.
     
     INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 141
     
     Meg races into Sarah's bedroom and tears open the door of a
     mini-fridge.  Inside are dozens of little bottles of insulin
     and something called Glucogen.
     
     She grabs a bottle of Glucogen and a black leather pouch and
     takes off.
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 142
     
     As Meg nears the bottom of the stairs, she sees a horrifying
     sight.  It's Raoul, ski mask over his face, standing in the
     doorway of the master bedroom.
     
     She SCREAMS, he SLAMS the door, she takes off down the hall,
     reaches the end, throws the door open --
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 143
     
     -- and races into the master bedroom, where Raoul is
     motoring, fast, headed for the panic room, where she can
     already see Burnham, standing in the middle of the open
     doorway, in front of Sarah, wearing Harris's shirt and a grim
     "tricked you" expression.
     
     Meg hurls herself at Raoul, lands clinging to his back.  She
     claws and wrestles with him, gets one hand on his ski mask,
     tears it from his head.  He reaches up to try to stop her
     from pulling it off --
     
     -- his gun slips from his fingers, falls to the floor --
     
     -- and caroms off his boot, spinning across the floor away
     from them.
     
     Raoul flips her off his back violently, she CRUNCHES to the
     floor, clutching his mask and getting a good long look at his
     face.  He makes a move toward his gun, but she's faster,
     she's already pawing herself frantically across the hardwood
     toward it.
     
     Raoul measures the distance, knows he'll lose, and sprints
     for the panic room instead.  Meg turns, looks down at the
     medicine in her hands, then at the door to the panic room,
     where Raoul is right now reaching up to push the button that
     controls the steel door.
     
     She makes a fast decision and lunges, hurling the plastic
     bottle of Glucogen and the black leather pouch through the
     gap just before --
     
     -- the spring-loaded steel door SLAMS shut with tremendous
     ferocity.
     
     And then it's silent.  Meg WAILS in agony, POUNDS on the
     door.
     
     She stands back, chest heaving, sobbing.
     
     A looooong moment goes by.
     
     Finally, a VOICE comes over the house's intercom system.
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
                    (calmly)
               If you leave the house, we'll kill
               her.
     
     Meg sobs.
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               If I see a uniform in the house,
               we'll kill her.
     
                          MEG
               Oh... oh...
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               You understand?
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Meg looks up at the camera in the master bedroom.  She nods,
     terrified.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Burnham pushes past Raoul, at the speaker button, and leans
     forward.  He's approaching exhaustion.
     
                          BURNHAM
                    (into speaker)
               I just... I just need forty-five
               minutes.
     
     Raoul stands behind him, muttering to himself.
     
                          RAOUL
               Saw my face, man.  Saw my face.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     we see Meg's face, agonized, as she lunges toward the camera,
     SCREAMING something up at it, the same thing, over and over.
     But in here her voice is nearly muted, what bleeds through
     the walls isn't enough to be heard.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Raoul looks at her image on the monitor, irritated.
     
                          RAOUL
               Shut up.
     
     IN THE MASTER BEDROOM,
     
     we abruptly hear her voice, full-throated.
     
                          MEG
                    (shouting into the camera)
               -- cine, she needs the MEDICINE!
               GIVE HER THE --
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah shivers in a corner, knees pulled up to her chest,
     staring at the intruders, scared out of her wits, and looking
     very, very sick.
     
     Burnham looks at her, musters the most reassuring face he can
     come up with under the circumstances.
     
                          BURNHAM
               It's gonna be cool, kid.  Be outta
               here before you know it.
     
     No response from Sarah.  Burnham cocks a head, really looking
     at her.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Are you okay?
     
                          RAOUL
               Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
     
     Burnham turns, grabs his satchel, and drops to his knees in
     the middle of the floor.  Over his shoulder, we can see the
     face of Meg on one of the monitors, shouting into the camera,
     begging them to give Sarah her medicine.
     
     Using his hand, Burnham measures six lengths in from the
     wall, then digs his fingernails into the weave of the carpet,
     looking for a seam.
     
     He finds one, gets hold of it on one edge, and runs his other
     hand along the seam till he finds a place where it seems to
     turn a corner.  He stands, hovering over the carpet, and
     pulls back evenly with both hands.
     
     The concealed carpet flap pulls back neatly, with the soft
     sound of tearing VELCRO.  Underneath the flap --
     
     -- is the smooth metal door of a floor safe.
     
     Burnham unsnaps his satchel and gives it a shove.  It rolls
     out and opens up onto the floor, revealing a neat array of
     safecracking tools.
     
     He begins his delicate work, but is suddenly jarred by a
     POUNDING on the metal door.  He turns, annoyed.  Meg is still
     SCREAMING outside the door.
     
                          BURNHAM
               The hell does she want?
     
                          RAOUL
               I don't know, she keeps screamin'
               the same thing over and over.
     
     Burnham turns, looks at the monitors.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Meg is staring up at the camera, miming the act of giving
     herself an injection in the arm.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Raoul laughs.
     
                          RAOUL
               Drugs.  She wants drugs.  What the
               fuck?
     
     But Burnham thinks.  His eyes fall on the bottle and the
     leather pouch she hurled through the door, then whip over to
     Sarah, who sags over into a fetal position on the floor.  Her
     lips are moving.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Oh, man...
     
     He crawls over to Sarah, puts his ear down next to Sarah's
     lips.
     
                          BURNHAM
               What is it?
     
     Sarah tries to summon enough strength to speak, but her
     breath comes hard.
     
                          SARAH
               I need...
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yeah?
     
                          SARAH
               ... 'jection...
     
                          BURNHAM
               An injection?
     
     Sarah nods.  Burnham points to the pouch and the Glucogen, on
     the floor nearby.
     
                          BURNHAM
               That stuff?
     
     Sarah nods again.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Can you do it yourself?
     
     Sarah shakes her head no.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Well, I don't know how.
     
     Sarah looks at him, eyes pleading.  Raoul stands behind
     Burnham.
     
                          RAOUL
               I don't fucking believe this.
                    (to Sarah)
               You gotta wait.
     
     Sarah just looks at Burnham.  Please.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a
               little more, and your mom'll give it
               to you.  You can wait a half hour,
               can't you?
     
                          RAOUL
               Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's
               just like, tired, she's gotta rest.
               You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
     
     Sarah looks terrified, shaking her head no.
     
                          RAOUL
               Come on.
     
     He starts to pull Burnham away, but Burnham shakes his hand
     off, violently.  He bends down very close to Sarah's lips.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Tell me the truth, okay?  What's
               gonna happen if you don't get this?
     
     Sarah swallows, licks her cracking lips.  When she speaks,
     it's breathy, almost inaudible.
     
     But the words are clear.
     
                          SARAH
               Coma.  Die.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 144
     
     Seen from overhead, Meg paces in the master bedroom, out of
     her mind with worry, no idea how to communicate to the people
     in the room the desperate situation.
     
     Suddenly, a VOICE comes over the intercom speaker.
     
                          BURNHAM (O.S.)
               I understand.  I'll give her the
               shot.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     A HAND comes down into frame and picks up the Glucogen and
     the leather pouch.  Burnham stands, looking down at them.
     Raoul grabs him, pulls him to the far end of the room.
     
                          RAOUL
               You're wasting your fucking time,
               man, you're wasting my time.  You
               don't know how to do this, and the
               longer we stay in here, the more
               likely she's gonna lose it and call
               the cops!
     
                          BURNHAM
               Are you gonna open the safe?
     
     Raoul looks at him.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Then shut up and get out of my way.
     
     As Burnham crosses the room, Raoul makes eye contact with
     Sarah, who is staring at him.
     
                          RAOUL
               Don't look at me.
     
     ACROSS THE ROOM,
     
     Burnham drops to his knees next to Sarah and unzips the
     pouch.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Okay, kid, all I know about this is
               what I've seen on TV, you gotta talk
               me through it.
     
     Sarah tries to form words, but she's too weak.  Burnham
     swallows.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Okay.  No talking.  No problem.  TV
               don't lie, right?
     
     He reaches into the pouch, take out a syringe, a sterile pad,
     and a length of rubber tubing.  He takes Sarah's arm,
     stretches it out, exposing the underside of her forearm.
     
                          BURNHAM
               You seem like a good kid.  Your
               mom... only saw her for a second,
               but, woah.  Beautiful, huh?
     
     No answer.  Burnham ties the rubber tubing around Sarah's
     arm, pulls it tight.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Hey, nod or something, show me
               you're still alive, will ya?
     
     Sarah nods.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Attagirl.  That too tight?
     
     Sarah shakes her head no.  Burnham takes the syringe, starts
     to fill it from the Glucogen bottle.
     
                          BURNHAM
               You guys are pretty rich, huh?
     
     Sarah shrugs.  While Burnham goes through the process of
     finding an exposed vein and giving the injection itself, he
     goes on, as much to comfort Sarah as to comfort himself:
     
                          BURNHAM
               Yeah, you don't think about that
               stuff.  Good for you.
     
     He looks at her, sees her looking at him.  Thinking about
     him.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I know, I know.  I really screwed
               the pooch this time.  I never did
               anything like this before.  Break
               into somebody's house?  Not even
               close.  Bad cards, Kid.  I swear to
               God, I been on the wrong end of
               maybe six straight years of bad
               cards.  House.  Car.  Wife.
                    (snaps his fingers --
                     gone)
               Those are some seriously bad cards.
               And still, every time I pick up a
               fresh hand I swear to God, the rush
               comes so hot and prickly I feel it
               right down to my toes because this
               time, this one time, it might be
               there, this time it might be that
               hand, that perfect hand, that
               monster hand.
                    (shakes his head)
               And you thought you were sick.
     
     The shot successfully given, he pulls Sarah's sleeve back
     down.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Feel better?
     
     Sarah nods, and she seems better already.  Burnham helps her
     to sit up, to lean against the wall.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Woulda been a hell of a dad.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     A VOICE comes over the intercom in the master bedroom.  It's
     Raoul.
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               She's okay.  Now sit down and wait.
     
     He CLICKS off.
     
     Meg is hugely relieved.  And extremely pissed off.  She goes
     to the corner of the room and picks up the gun, the one that
     Raoul dropped.
     
     She heads downstairs.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Sparks fly as Burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a
     small, specialized drill.
     
     Raoul bends down next to him.
     
                          RAOUL
               Congratulations.  You saved her life
               for ten minutes.
     
     Burnham looks up at him -- what?  But Raoul turns and walks
     away.
     
     Burnham goes back to work.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Meg is in the living room, with Harris, who is still slouched
     in the chair.  He's in awful shape, barely conscious.
     
     Out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound.
     
     The DOORBELL.
     
     Her eyes go wide.  She darts a look over to the door (the one
     that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door
     downstairs), then back at Harris.
     
                          HARRIS
               Police.
     
                          MEG
                    (gasps)
               You called the police?
     
     He nods.
     
                          HARRIS
               You... scared...
     
     Shit.  This is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now
     it's the worst thing that could happen.
     
     She stands, thinking, desperate.  She walks toward the door,
     stops, thinks some more.
     
     The doorbell RINGS again.
     
     She comes up with a plan.  She goes back to where Harris is
     in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of
     the door.  She puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it
     to steady it.
     
     She leans down, WHISPERS to him.
     
                          MEG
               Don't.  Say.  A word.
     
     He nods.
     
     Meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair
     as she goes.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.
     
                          RAOUL
               Holy shit... holy shit...
     
     Burnham races over, looks over his shoulder.  One monitor
     covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly
     see TWO UNIFORMED COPS.
     
                          RAOUL
               She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the
               kid!  She just killed her own kid!
     
                          BURNHAM
               It's not her fault, it's not her
               fault, the guy must have called
               them.  Look, look, look, she's
               telling us.
     
     He points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where Meg
     is looking up at the camera, miming to them -- don't worry,
     I'll take care of this.
     
                          BURNHAM
               She's gonna handle it.
     
                          RAOUL
               She better.
     
     INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
     
     Meg's shaking hand rises up to the doorknob and pulls open
     the big front door.  On the stoop, the two Cops turn to look
     at her.  She acts as if she's just been awakened.  She looks
     it, too, still in T-shirt and boxer shorts.  The wind is
     gusty and cold outside.
     
                          MEG
               Yeah?
     
                          COP 1
               Everything okay?
     
                          MEG
               Huh?
     
                          COP 2
               Are you all right?
     
                          MEG
               What are you guys -- what time is
               it?
     
                          COP 1
               'Bout four o'clock.
     
                          MEG
               I don't get it.
     
                          COP 2
               We got a call...
     
     Cop 1 looks at him.  Cop 2 stops talking.
     
                          MEG
               Somebody called you?
     
                          COP 1
               Can we come in?
     
                          MEG
               What do you want?
     
                          COP 1
               We'd like to come in.
     
                          MEG
               No, you can't come in.
     
                          COP 2
               Are you okay?
     
                          MEG
               I'm fine.
     
                          COP 1
               Can we come in?
     
                          MEG
               Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who
               called you?
     
                          COP 1
               You don't look so good.
     
                          MEG
               You wake me out of a sound sleep at
               four in the morning and then tell me
               I look like hell?  Of course I look
               like hell, you don't look so hot
               yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here,
               thank you for checking, can I go?
     
     Cop 1 studies her, notices the burned sleeve of her T-shirt,
     the black smudges still on her face.
     
                          COP 1
               Your husband says you said "There
               are three..." right before you got
               cut off.
     
                          MEG
               Oh, that phone call...
     
     Cop 1 takes a step forward and lowers his voice to just above
     a whisper, unconsciously making her lean forward in order to
     hear him.
     
                          COP 1
               Ma'am, if there's something you want
               to say to us right now that maybe
               you can't say to us right now, maybe
               you just want to make a signal, by
               blinking a few times, something like
               that.
     
     She just looks at him.  Wow, this guy's intuitive.  She is
     sorely tempted.  But she can't.
     
                          COP 1
               That's something you could do.
               Safely.
     
     She thinks, thinks --
     
     -- and burst out laughing.
     
                          MEG
               Man, you are good!  You mean, like,
               if somebody was in the house or
               something?  That's great, they
               really train you guys these days,
               don't they?
     
     Cop 1 looks at her, not sure if he believes her or not.
     
                          MEG
               No.  I'm fine.  Cross my heart.
     
     Cop 2 turns to go, but Cop 1 lingers.
     
                          COP 1
               May I ask what the rest of that
               sentence was going to be?
     
                          MEG
                    (stalling)
               Huh?
     
                          COP 1
               The sentence that started "There are
               three."  What was the rest?
     
     Pause.  She stares at him.
     
                          MEG
               Okay, look.  My husband and I just
               broke up.  It's my first night in
               the new house, and I was feeling a
               little lonely and a little drunk.
               The sentence, if you insist on
               knowing, was going to be "There are
               three things I'll do for you if you
               come over right now and get in bed
               with me."
     
     Cop 2 stifles a laugh.
     
                          MEG
               But thank God I came to my senses
               before I said all that and hung up
               instead, so nobody would ever know
               what I was thinking, unless, of
               course, two policemen showed up in
               the middle of the night to
               interrogate me about it.
     
     That was good.  Cop 1 is embarrassed.  Cop 2 thinks it's
     funny.
     
                          COP 2
               You want her to show you which three
               things, Rick, or should we just go?
     
     Cop 1 looks at Meg, a long look, he holds it for one last
     moment, trying to read her mind.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     we see the video image of the Cops as they turn and head away
     down the front steps.  Meg closes the doors, looks up into a
     camera, right at us.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Burnham and Raoul breathe a sigh of relief.
     
     Burnham goes back to work on the safe.  He's making progress.
     
     Raoul looks at Sarah.  Stares actually.  He's thinking too.
     
     Bad thoughts.  He moves over, crouches down next to Burnham.
     
                          RAOUL
               She saw my face.  The kid too.
     
     Sarah overhears that.  She raises her head, alarmed.  Burnham
     turns, looks over at her, and she just gets her head back
     down in time.  Burnham and Raoul close themselves off, for a
     private conversation.
     
     Sarah edges closer.  She overhears a fragment.
     
                          BURNHAM
               That's your problem.
     
                          RAOUL
               That's their problem.
     
     Sarah is terrified.  Doesn't know what to do.  She looks to
     her immediate left, sees the intercom panel.  She edges
     closer.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Let me fucking finish this so we can
               get out of here.
     
                          RAOUL
               You finish.  Then we finish.
     
     Sarah sneaks up a hand and pushes a button -- "ALL PAGE."
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     In the living room, there is an audible CLICK as the speaker
     is activated.  Meg looks up, hears Burnham's voice, in the
     middle of a sentence.
     
                          BURNHAM (O.S.)
               -- posed to mean?
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               You're here with me, you're already
               on the hook for one.  Buy one, you
               get the rest for the same price.
               You know that.
     
                          BURNHAM (O.S.)
               Get the fuck away from me.
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               The kid in here.  The other two when
               we come out.
     
     Meg listens, horrified.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Sarah holds the intercom button down with a trembling finger.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Bullshit.
     
                          RAOUL
               You know how this gotta end.
     
     INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Meg stares, in shock, as Raoul's voice echoes in the empty
     room.
     
                          RAOUL (O.S.)
               They stay in the house.
     
     There in an abrupt CLICK, and the speaker turns off.  Meg
     turns, goes to Harris, falls to her knees, no idea what to
     do.  She holds him close, their foreheads touching.  She's
     terrified, exhausted, wants to collapse in his arms.
     
     Instead, she starts to pull the gun from his fingers.  He
     tightens his grip, what are you doing?  He tries to hold onto
     the gun, but she pulls his fingers off it, takes it away from
     him.  He is too weak to resist.
     
                                                       CUT TO:
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     In the panic room, Sarah has her hands clamped over her ears,
     her mouth is wide open, and a hideous METAL SHRIEK seems to
     be coming out of it.
     
     But the SHRIEK is actually coming from the safe, where
     Burnham continues to work, another drill, a bigger bit.  The
     noise is deafening.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Sarah sees her mother approaching the monitor in the bedroom,
     carrying a jacket.  Meg tosses the jacket, this time she
     doesn't want them to see what she's doing.
     
     The monitor goes black.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     In the master bedroom, Meg pulls on a pair of jeans that are
     hanging over a chair.
     
     She steps into a pair of boots.
     
     She shoves the gun into her belt.
     
     Here in the bedroom, she can hear the drill.  From the house
     next door, she hears POUNDING again, more MUFFLED CURSES.
     Apparently the neighbor can hear the drill too.
     
     Meg looks from the walls of the bedroom to the walls of the
     panic room.  Her eyes light up with an idea.
     
     She goes to the front wall of the bedroom, stands with her
     back against the exterior wall (street side), with her left
     shoulder against the common wall that's shared with the
     neighbor's brownstone.
     
     She begins to step off the distance, heel to toe, measuring
     with her feet until she reaches the metal door that is the
     entrance to the panic room.
     
                          MEG
               Fourteen.
     
     She hurries out of the bedroom.  What's she doing?
     
     INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
     
     Meg comes into a small room full of empty bookshelves, a
     library.  There is a window that looks out over the sidewalk,
     one floor up, same level as the stoop.
     
     She looks up, into the corners of the room.
     
                          MEG
               No camera, no camera, no camera...
     
     They're bare, no video cameras.  Good.
     
     She goes to the window, tries to open it.  Screwed shut, of
     course.
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The safe is almost cracked.  Raoul is watching the monitors
     carefully.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     we see Meg as she searches through the tools in the living
     room, finds a screwdriver, a sledgehammer.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Raoul furrows his brow.  Now what?
     
     INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
     
     Meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window.
     She gets the last screw out, shoves the window up.
     
     The wind BLASTS in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there.
     
     She leans out the window.  We lean with her.  The sidewalk is
     empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the
     house).  She's one floor up.  To her right is the house's
     front stoop.
     
     She tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop.  Climbs up
     onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself.
     
     We lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops
     down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror --
     
     -- at the video camera that covers the front stoop.
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly
     standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was
     specifically told not to go.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah sees the image of her on the stoop.  Raoul happens to
     be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to
     turn around, to look at the monitors again --
     
     -- and Sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.
     
                          RAOUL
               Hey!
     
     He turns, away from the monitors.
     
                          SARAH
               Sorry.  Can't control it sometimes.
     
     Raoul scowls at her.  Behind him --
     
     ON THE MONITORS,
     
     Meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on
     the monitor.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Sarah sees her mother go.
     
                          SARAH
                    (to Raoul)
               Won't happen again.
     
     INT.  LIBRARY - NIGHT
     
     Still leaning out the window, we can see Meg from here as she
     reaches the sidewalk and runs up the front steps of the
     neighbor's house, which is contiguous.
     
     Straining to see (yet stay in the house), we see Meg all the
     way at the right edge of the frame, as she shifts the gun to
     the back of her pants and knocks on the neighbor's door,
     sledgehammer held slightly behind her leg.
     
     After a long moment, we hear the neighbor's front door open.
     The conversation begins.  The wind is gusting right in our
     faces, we can't make out the details, but the gist is clear --
     let me into your house, and don't as me a lot of questions.
     
     The NEIGHBOR -- and by the tone of the voice it sounds like
     an old woman -- is slow to respond, grumpy.
     
     Losing patience, Meg just pulls the Neighbor out of the way
     and shoves into the house.  The Neighbor stumbles out onto
     her front stoop, and we were right, it's an old lady in a
     nightgown, but she's no shrinking violet.  In fact, she's
     royally pissed off and not at all intimidated.
     
                          NEIGHBOR
               What the hell do you think you're
               doing, young lady?!
     
     She storms back into her house, following Meg.  As both of
     them disappear from the frame, we move out of the library,
     into the foyer, and move along the common wall, the one
     shared with the neighbor's brownstone.
     
     From the other side of the wall, we can hear muffled voices,
     arguing, Meg and the Neighbor shouting at each other.
     
     We drift up, up the stairs, and hear the THUNDERING of
     footsteps on the stairs next door.  We keep pace with them,
     from inside this house.  We pass right through the floor --
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     -- and rise up out of the floor in the master bedroom, and
     now we can hear the conversation on the other side of the
     wall in here, the Neighbor's fearful, angry tones, Meg's
     firm, urgent declarations.
     
     We move with Meg, even though we can't see her, we know what
     she's doing, she's stepping off the paces on the other side
     of the wall.  We drift down that wall, fourteen steps, until
     we reach the metal door to the panic room, then we pass
     through that door --
     
     INT.  PANIC ROOM - NIGHT
     
     -- and arrive inside the panic room, where Burnham is this
     close to getting the safe open, when all of a sudden --
     
     WHOMP.
     
     CRUNCH.
     
     Burnham and Raoul freeze, alarmed.  It's coming from the long
     wall, the shared wall.
     
     They look at each other.
     
     WHOMP.
     
     CRUNCH.
     
     They look at the wall.
     
     Somebody is on the other side, pounding like hell.
     
                          RAOUL
               The walls are steel, right?
     
                          BURNHAM
               Not that one.
     
                          RAOUL
               NOT THAT ONE?!
     
                          BURNHAM
               Hey man, it's the neighbor's house,
               who breaks in through the neighbor's
               house?!
     
     WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
     
     Louder.  Closer.  Burnham turns, SCREAMS at the wall.
     
                          BURNHAM
               WHO THE FUCK BREAKS IN THROUGH THE
               NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE?!
     
                          RAOUL
               We've got the Kid!
                    (shouting at the wall)
               WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck
               is she thinking?!
     
     WHOMP!  CRUNCH!
     
                          BURNHAM
               She's got your gun, that's what
               she's thinking!  The FUCK you had to
               bring a gun for?!
     
     Burnham throws himself back on the floor, goes back to work
     on the safe.  Fires up the drill again, it SCREAMS into the
     metal.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Almost there...
     
     The POUNDING keeps up from next door.  We hear sheetrock torn
     away on the far side.  Bricks, SCRAPING out of place.
     
     Sarah, in the corner, is energized, excited.  While Burnham
     and Raoul are distracted, she grabs the leather pouch, palms
     the three syringes that are left in there.
     
                          BURNHAM
               ALMOST THERE...
     
     Finally, the door to the safe CRUNCHES in on one side,
     yielding to the drilling --
     
     -- at the very moment that the head of a sledgehammer CRASHES
     through the wall of the panic room.  Raoul grabs hold of
     Sarah, Burnham maintains his focus, throwing open the safe,
     revealing --
     
     -- nothing.
     
     CRUNCH!
     
     The sledgehammer head strikes again, opening up a hole about
     a foot across.  Light spills through from the other side, as
     well as the voice of the hysterical Neighbor.
     
     Raoul hurls Sarah against the far wall, leaps over to the
     side of the hole, and waits, poised above it.
     
     At the safe, Burnham doesn't lose his cool, just opens a
     false bottom in the safe, revealing a manila envelope.
     
     He snatches it up, RIPS it open, and his eyes dance as he
     holds up fourteen individual one million dollar U,S, Treasury
     Bearer Bonds.  He fans them out, eyes drinking from his
     Grail.
     
     BANG!
     
     A gunshot whizzes right through one of the bonds, setting it
     aflame before it SLAMS into the far wall, sending up a little
     cloud of plaster dust.
     
                          BURNHAM
               JESUS!
     
     He whirls, sees an arm poking through the hole in the wall,
     gun extended.
     
     But Raoul is standing just above the hole, and already has
     his boot raised, over the hand.  He brings it down, a
     CRUNCHING blow that stomps right on Meg's wrist.
     
     Meg SCREAMS, loses her grip on the gun, and it CLATTERS into
     the space between the houses.
     
     BETWEEN THE WALLS,
     
     the gun falls into oblivion, the space between the walls,
     where no one can get to it.
     
     IN THE PANIC ROOM,
     
     Burnham shoves the loose bonds into his jacket.
     
                          BURNHAM
               I GOT THE MONEY, LET'S GO!!!
     
     Raoul grabs Sarah and turns, jabs the green button to open
     the door.
     
     Behind them, Meg SCREAMS in anger and wriggles through the
     opening.  Before she's even all the way through, she gets
     hold of Raoul's leg and pulls herself into the panic room,
     scraping and bloodying herself on the edges of the too-small
     hole.
     
                          BURNHAM
               GO, LET'S GO, OUTTA HERE!!
     
     But Raoul is deep in a violent rage.  Still holding Sarah
     with one hand, he bends down, grabs Meg by the hair, and
     drags her toward the doorway.
     
                          RAOUL
               YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
     
                          BURNHAM
               FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
     
     He bolts out of the room, through the metal door, which is
     just finishing its slow crank open, its heavy spring coiling
     in the wall.
     
     Raoul drag Meg across the floor by the hair, right into the
     track of the open steel door.
     
     She looks up, sees the infrared safety beam over her head,
     and  realizes with horror what his intention is.
     
     Still with one arm holding Sarah, who is kicking and
     struggling viciously, Raoul holds Meg's head down on the
     floor, below the safety beam that would prevent the door from
     closing.  He reaches for the "close" button.
     
     Sarah raises her arm, stuffed with three syringes, and jabs
     them into Raoul's neck.  Raoul SCREAMS in pain.
     
     Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam.
     
     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
     
     On the stairwell, Burnham, stops, frozen, his face twitching
     with indecision.  He hears the murder taking place just above
     him.
     
     He runs down three steps.
     
     Stops again.
     
     Runs down the rest of the stairs.
     
     INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Raoul stretches to push the red "close" button for the door,
     but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
     with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
     same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
     
     Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
     
     Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
     
     Raoul jabs the button --
     
     -- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
     at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
     broken, the door will not close.
     
     Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
     flying across the room.
     
     Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
     beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
     again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
     breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
     
     But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
     up, her head trembles --
     
     -- and collapses onto the floor.
     
     The beam completes --
     
     -- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
     
     -- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
     reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
     Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
     
     -- into the gap --
     
     -- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
     that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
     
     Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
     tight.
     
     The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
     Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
     
     Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
     
     They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
     contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
     
     She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
     
     He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away.
     
     INT.  ENTRY FLOOR - NIGHT
     
     Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
     throws it open --
     
     -- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
     blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
     gun.
     
     It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
     was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
     smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
     know his suspicions were correct.
     
                          COP 1
               Put your hands up.
     
     Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
     blow into the house, a real gale outside.
     
     From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
     half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
     the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
     ROARING wind.
     
     Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
     Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
     doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
     CRACK through the door behind him.
     
     Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
     door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
     of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
     chest, a triangle pattern.
     
     Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
     jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
     
     He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
     playing cards.
     
                          BURNHAM
               Monster hand.
     
     Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
     appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
     bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
     poker.
     
     He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
     twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
     foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
     bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
     as if they were never meant to leave.
     
     Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
     ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
     suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
     his head as he dies.
     
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
     
     EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - GREAT LAWN - DAY
     
     The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
     air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
     down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
     saw in Meg's hallucination.
     
     But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
     throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
     nothing.
     
     The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
     out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
     to the ads.
     
     Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
     at the clouds.
     
     Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.
     
                          SARAH
               I mean, uptown is close to Dad's
               place, but somebody at school said
               the Village is really cool, so... I
               don't know, it's so great to be
               close to the park and everything...
               What do you think, I mean, give me a
               clue, here, where are we gonna live?
     
     Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
     years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
     daughter's hair behind one ear.
     
     She smiles.  She is calm.
     
     Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
     clear autumn sky.
     
                                                     FADE OUT.
