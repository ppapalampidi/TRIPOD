    FADE IN:

1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1

    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               ... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                     2.

    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.

                            MAN
              Sherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.

                            HOLMES
              My apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.

    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.

3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3

    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.

                                                           CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

                                                    3.

5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5

    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.


    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED

    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.

    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE

    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.


    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.

                            THUG
              What's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.

                            HOLMES
              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.

7   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                          7

    TWO HARD MEN in bowler hats stand guard.

                                                           CUT TO:
                                                  (CONTINUED)

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
    Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --

    A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
    reveal --

    (The following exchange in whispers.)

                              HOLMES
              Watson.    Perfect timing.

                              WATSON
              Nice hat.

                              HOLMES
              Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?

                            WATSON
              Getting his troops in formation.
              Is that your blood or theirs?

                              HOLMES
              I don't know.    It's an old shirt.

                            WATSON
              You left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.

                            HOLMES
              Knew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.

                              WATSON
              You did.

                              HOLMES
              Right.    Shall we?

    This is what they do.    This is what they like.

                                                              CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together
    as they hear footsteps approaching.

                              MAN #1
              Des?

    He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.

                            WATSON
              Yeah, s'me.




                                                  (CONTINUED)

     Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler,
     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.

9    INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                      9

     Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.

     A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
     (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

9A                                                                9A
     INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS
     The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               The girl.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

9A   CONTINUED:                                                     9A
     The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.

                             WATSON
               Lord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               Stay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.

                             HOLMES
               No.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.

                             HOLMES
               Look.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                       8.

     Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks,
     sees nothing.

                               HOLMES
               Look.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.

                               BLACKWOOD
               What a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.

                             HOLMES
               Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

                             LESTRADE
                    (vis Blackwood)
               Is that -- ?

                               WATSON
               It is.

                             HOLMES
                    (re: girl)
               We've gone for the doctor...
                    (re: Blackwood)
               And one for the rope.

                             LESTRADE
               You should've waited for my help.

                             HOLMES
               If I had, you'd be cleaning up a
               corpse and chasing a rumor.
               Besides, the girl's parents hired
               me, not the Yard.
                    (a wry smile)
               I can't imagine why they thought
               you'd need any assistance.

      Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
      while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
      still mouthing the incantation.

      Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
      head, not understanding them.

      Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to,
      he turns to Holmes.

                               LESTRADE
                 What do you make of that?

                 Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.

      Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket
      and --

      -- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera.

      FROM A RAVEN'S POV

      We FOLLOW a lady, MRS. HUDSON, walking down the street
      with the day's shopping. She picks up a paper with the
      day's headline "BLACKWOOD HANGS TOMORROW: CLAIMS PACK
      WITH THE DEVIL." She continues down the street until
      arriving at 221 Baker Street. A raven lands on the entry
      gate, she shoos it away, walks up the steps, and inside.


12    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - WATSON'S APARTMENT                        12

      Watson takes a blood pressure cuff off CAPTAIN PHILIPS,
      an OLDER GENTLEMAN who sports an array of medals. The
      room is a tribute to military and medical order -- all is
      neat and tidy, everything in its place.

                              WATSON
                71 over 104... very good, Captain.

                              CAPTAIN PHILIPS
                Me nerves are the best they been
                in years, thanks to you.

               Tell me something -- your new
               offices. There won't be so many

     Watson suppresses extreme irritation, writes a
     prescription on a piece of paper, then helps Captain
     Philips to his feet.

                             WATSON
               Let's give it a little longer,
               just to be safe.

     is turned to his patient.


13   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HALL                                    13

     As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
     MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the
     paper. Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'.

                             MRS. HUDSON
                    (panting)
               I won't go in there by myself, not
               while he's in this state.

                             WATSON
               You're not going in at all.

     Which is a relief to Mrs. Hudson.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               What will I do when you leave?
               He'll burn the house down around
               me. What will he do? Couldn't
               you have a longer engagement?

                             WATSON
               He just needs a new case, that's
               all.

     Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads
     towards them.

                             WATSON
               I smell burning.

     Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the
     worse. Watson takes the newspaper from her.

                             WATSON
               Why don't you take Captain Philips
               and give him a nice cup of tea.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               Come on, Captain, let's go down.
               It'll be quieter.

                             WATSON
                    (as they leave)
               And perhaps some tea and bread up
               here when you can.

     Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A
     tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
     himself. Something    like this has happened before (is, in
     fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being,
     now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it.

     Which doesn't mean he won't.

     Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head
     in, cautiously. He sees --


14   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS                       14

     Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the                
     obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a               
     chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd                 
     contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.                    

     Unadulterated chaos. A series of FLAMING BULLET HOLES               
     blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "V.R."

                             WATSON                                      
               May I join you in the armory?                             

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Watson, I've been                               
               working on a device which will                            
               suppress the sound of a gunshot.                          

     Watson heads towards the conservatory.                              

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Don't, don't, don't...                          

     Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour           
     in.

               It needs work.     May I see?...                          

     Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room             
     (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open                  
     letters from a table.

               Gently, gently, Watson...                                 

     Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window.                 

     Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table                
     where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on.                     

     Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the                
     letters.

               I have been studying her comings                         
               and goings and they appear most                          
               sinister.

               Tea, Mr. Holmes.                                         

     Mrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before             
     him.

               Is it poisoned, nanny?                                   

                             MRS. HUDSON                                
               There's enough of that in you                            
               already.                                                 

     She goes to remove an old tray from behind him.                    

                             HOLMES                                     
               Don't touch that. Everything is                          
               in its proper place, as per usual.                       

     She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back             
     towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious              
     under the table.

               He's killed the dog... again.                            

     Watson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the               
     floor in a drugged stupor.

               this time?

               I was simply testing a new                               
               anesthetic. He doesn't mind.                             

                              WATSON

     Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos.
     For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.

                                                       CUT TO:

15   INT. THE ROYALE - DINING ROOM                               15

     Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
     to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.

     WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
     information from the other guests. He notices the
     details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
     bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
     It all becomes quite overbearing.

     And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
     other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
     there.

                              WATSON
               Holmes!   You're early.
                              HOLMES
               Fashionably.

                             WATSON
               May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

     Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
     beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
     Holmes stands. She extends her hand.

                             HOLMES
               My pleasure. For the life of me I
               don't know why it's taken him so
               long to get us properly
               introduced.

     Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
     either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
     on the table.

                             MARY
               The pleasure's mine. It really is
               a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.

               They can seem a bit far-fetched
               sometimes, though. Making these
               grand assumptions out of tiny
               details.

               I intend to.

     Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.

                             HOLMES
               ... see that walking-stick? A
               rare African snakewood hiding a
               blade of high-tensile steel. A
               few were awarded to veterans of
               the Afghan war, so I can assume
               he's a decorated soldier. Strong,
               brave, born to be a man of action.
               And neat, like all military men.
               Then I check his pockets... ah. A
               stub from a boxing match. Now I
               can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
                    (a wink)
               I'd keep an eye on that, by the
               way.

               Those days are behind me.

               He's cost us the rent more than
               once.

     Mary laughs.

                              MARY
               With all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
               you know him. But what about a
               perfect stranger? What can you
               tell about me?

     Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.

                             WATSON
               I don't think that's necessary --

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Yes, I doubt --

                                MARY
                  No, it'd be wonderful.   I insist.

                                HOLMES
                  You insist?
                       (at Watson)
                  She insisted.
                       (instantly)
                  You're a governess.

                                MARY
                  Well done.

                                WATSON
                  Yes, well done. So shall we --

                                HOLMES
                  Your student's a boy of 8.

                                MARY
                  Charlie's 7, actually.

     Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine.     Holmes
     stops him.

                                HOLMES
                  It's breathing.
                       (back to Mary)
                  Then he's tall for his age.

     Mary nods.

               He flicked ink at you today.

                             MARY
               Is there ink on my face?

     The WAITER appears.

                             WATSON
               There's nothing wrong with your
               face.

                             WAITER
               The gentleman has already ordered
               for himself.
                    (to Watson)
               What would madam care for this
               evening?

     Watson gives Holmes a hard look:   that's a bit much.

                             WATSON
               Give us a few minutes, please.

     He shakes his head, pours wine for all.

                             HOLMES
               There are two drops on your ear...
               India blue's nearly impossible to
               wash off, anyway. A very
               impetuous act by the boy, but
               you're too experienced to react
               rashly -- which is why the lady
               you work for lent you that
               necklace. It's from Asprey's,
               flawless, not the gems of a
               governess.
                    (beat)
               However, the jewels you're not
               wearing tell us rather more.

               Holmes.

     Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
     Holmes pauses... pauses, then:

                             HOLMES
               You were engaged.

     Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.   He begins talking
     faster, intensely focused, manic.

                             HOLMES
               The ring is gone. But the lighter
               skin where it sat suggests you
               spent some time abroad wearing it
               proudly.

     As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
     her feet. They're leaving.

                             HOLMES
               Or at least until someone informed
               you of its true and rather modest
               worth, at which point you broke
               off the engagement and returned to
               England for better prospects. A
               doctor perhaps.

     Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The
     restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.

                             MARY
                    (low)
               Right on all counts but one. I
               didn't leave my fiance... he died.

     Now she leaves --

                 Well done, old man.

       -- and Watson goes with her.

       Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.

                                 HOLMES
                 She's lovely.

       Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
       his face.

       Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
       The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
       his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
       spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
       cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.


       HOLMES' POV

       Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
       Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
       The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
       china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --

       -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
       fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.

       NIGHT

       Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
       blood from a split lip. It interests him.
       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
       opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
       together and moves in.

       Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.


       HOLMES' POV

       The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
       indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
       experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
       the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.




                                                      (CONTINUED)

       He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
       moment.

       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.


       BACK TO SCENE

       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
       himself.

       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
       obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
       in control --

       -- until he notices a face at ringside.


       CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

       Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
       slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.

       Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.

                                HOLMES
                 Well done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

                                McMURDO
                 Oi!   We ain't done here.

                               HOLMES
                      (walking away)
                 Not done. Finished. And as I
                 said, thank you, it was most
                 pleasurable.

       Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.

                                  HOLMES
                   Hm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

18A                                                                   18A

       cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A
       full-scale riot is on.

       Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the
       doors to quiet the prisoners.

       The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who
       is frozen on the spot.

                And now he's in some kind of fit.

      The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see
      another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.

                Charlie, get, down here and get

      Blackwood sits dead center in the dark.   Eyes closed,
      WHISPERING ungodly sounds.

      On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols,
      sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down
      cross. A hint of some method to his madness.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                All right, Blackwood, what's this
                all about?

                stop this devil nonsense. That's
                a holy book --

      Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.

                     (louder)
                -- and you will respect it!

      Blackwood starts whispering FASTER.   LOUDER.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                Boy, you want me to muzzle you --

      Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused.
      He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.

     Blackwood keeps whispering.     The Captain falls to one
     knee, keeps coughing.

     Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
     onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:

     It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.

     Prisoners start SHOUTING.   The RAVEN at Blackwood's
     windowsill flutters away.   Other guards run up,
     terrified.

     Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks
     up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's
     eyes snap open.

     The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few
     people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood.
     Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.

     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC
     Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
                             WATSON
               You know this is for eye surgery?

                             HOLMES
               I find that it lifts my spirits.

                             WATSON
               It's a pathological amorbic
               process, it increases tissue
               change and weakness. And you know
               what a black reaction comes on you
               afterwards.

     No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
     has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
     full of FLIES all buzzing about.

               Look at this. If you play a
               chromatic scale, they move
               clockwise. As soon as you switch
               to a pentatonic scale --

     Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop
     moving, stick to the glass.

                             WATSON
                    (faking interest)
               Really? What about when you --
               oops --

     Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes
     looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.

                 That's your job, not mine.

                 You're Blackwood's last request.
                 Says he has information he'll give
                 only to you.

     But Watson's already out the door.


23   EXT. LONDON - DAWN                                             23

     Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.

                               HOLMES
                 Look at that structure. What has
                 it been? Five years' work
                 already? Are you aware that is
                 the first combination of bascule
                 and suspension bridge. Very
                 innovative.

     No reply.

     As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his
     pocket and pulls out a wad of money.

                Oh, I have your cut from last
                night, by the way. You weren't
                there so I laid your customary
                bet --

     Silence.   Holmes takes off his shirt.

                              HOLMES
                You're right... I'll keep it with
                your check book, locked safely
                away in my drawer.

     Silence.   Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.

                              HOLMES
                The opera house is featuring Don
                Giovanni and I could easily
                procure two tickets if you had
                some cultural inclination this
                evening.

     Silence.

                              HOLMES
                You have the grand gift of
                silence, Watson. It makes you
                quite invaluable as a companion.

     Watson punches him square in the face.

                              WATSON
                And your grand gift is the uncanny
                ability to demoralize people. I
                was aware she'd been engaged. She
                told me.
     Holmes rubs his jaw.

                              HOLMES
                So that's a `no' to the opera
                then?

     Watson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest.

                              WATSON
                That's my waistcoat.

                              HOLMES
                It's too small for you.

                              WATSON
                Well, it's my property and I want
                it back.

     Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses
     out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the
     opposite window.

                                                    26A.



24   EXT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - EARLY MORNING                     24

     Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are
     for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious
     zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from
     the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops.

                             WATSON
               You go ahead. I've no business
               with him while he's alive.

26   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAWN                    26

     A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy
     corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY.

                             HOLMES
               Where are all the other prisoners?

                             GUARD
               We had to move `em, sir, otherwise
               we were going to have a riot on
               our hands. There's something
               about him... it's like he can get
               inside your head.

     Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.

                             HOLMES
               I'm sure I can find my own way
               from here, if you have other
               duties to attend to.

                             GUARD
               Much obliged, sir. Thank you,
               thank you.

     The Guard high-tails it out of there.

     INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY
     Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling
     insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In
     the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's
     reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting
     closer.
                             BLACKWOOD
               QUOTE from Revelations tbd...

     Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes.

     They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other
     up.

                             HOLMES
               Love what you've done with the
               place.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Thank you for joining me.

               A small point of concern.

                             BLACKWOOD
               How can I help?

                             HOLMES
               I'd already followed the murders
               with some interest and while my
               heart went out to the families of
               the victims, I couldn't but notice
               a criminal mastery in the stroke
               of your brush --

                             BLACKWOOD
               You're too kind.

                             HOLMES
               However, by comparison, your work
               in the crypt was akin to a finger
               painting.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.

                             BLACKWOOD
               So now you're curious as to
               whether there's a larger game
               afoot, and that's why you're
               really here.

                             HOLMES
               Actually, my friend will pronounce
               you dead shortly and I thought I
               might keep him company.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Allow me to enlighten you. Your
               mistake is to imagine that
               anything earthly has led to this
               moment. Your error in judgement
               is to assume I've been holding the
               brush at all -- I am merely the
               channel.

     Despite the bars between them, the men are close
     together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.

               My only wish is that I'd caught
               you earlier. I might have spared
               five lives.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Those lives were a necessity, a
               sacrifice. Five otherwise
               meaningless creatures called to
               serve a greater purpose.

                             HOLMES
               I wonder if they'd let Watson and
               I dissect your brain -- after
               you're hanged, of course. I'd
               wager there's some deformity that
               would be scientifically
               significant. Then you would serve
               a greater purpose, too.

                              BLACKWOOD
               Mr. Holmes, you must widen your
               gaze. I'm concerned you
               underestimate the gravity of
               coming events.
                    (beat)
               For you and I are bound on a
               journey that will twist the very
               fabric of nature.
                    (beat)
               I sense fragility beneath your
               mask of logic, and it worries me.
               Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
               you.

     Holmes steps back, shakes his head.

                             HOLMES
               I must say, you've come a long way
               down from the House of Lords.

                             BLACKWOOD
               But I will rise again.

                             HOLMES
               Bon voyage, Blackwood.

     As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Pay attention! Three more shall
               die, and there is nothing you can
               do to save them.

                              IRENE (O.S.)                                
                London's so bleak this time of                            
                year.

     REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,           
     cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her                
     every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,                  
     putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a              
     smile.                                                             

                             IRENE                                      
               Not that I'm pining for New                              
               Jersey.                                                  

     Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is             
     turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this          
     intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over             
     to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's           
     still locked.                                                      

                             IRENE                                      
               I prefer to travel in the winter.                        

     As she passes a small table that has been outfitted with           
     tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...                                   

                             IRENE                                      
               I brought a few souvenirs. Dates                         
               from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and                         
               olives from Cyclades. I thought                          
               we'd have a little tea party to                          
               cheer us up.                                             

     Irene grabs a file from Holmes' desk.                              

                             IRENE                                      
               I came across this as I was                              
               setting up.                                              

     Irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings            
     and police reports, her back to Holmes.                            

                             IRENE

     Holmes stealthily turns down a photo of Irene, just                
     before she turns back to face him.

               But your signature is clear.                             

     Holmes reaches for Irene and pulls on a chain around her           
     neck, revealing and enormous diamond.

     TRACK INTO Irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. Holmes             
     almost melts. Then, Irene reaches for something inside             
     her jacket and Holmes grabs her hand.                              

                             IRENE

     Irene pulls out an ENVELOPE.

               Keep your money. I didn't say I'd

     She ignores him. Holmes examines the envelope. On it is          
     stamped the letterhead of the Grand Hotel. She pauses

     Irene descends the stairs just as Watson is coming in.
     He lifts his hat, waits for her to pass --

               Hello, John.

     We PICK UP Irene crossing a street. She passes a DARK
     ALLEYWAY. Pauses. Looks. She turns into the alley.
     HOLD ON the alley for a long beat. Too dark to see much
     in there.

     emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses.
     She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.

     INT. CARRIAGE
     Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
     the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
     speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is
     PROFESSOR MORIARTY.

     Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
     complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
     paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL
     ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and
     slides the folded paper partway out.

     Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
     footsteps clatter away.

     Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
     moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
     finally prepared to engage with her.

                             MORIARTY
               I assume he'll do it?

                             IRENE
               Not for money, but for me.   I
               wager he'll find our man within
               twenty-four hours.

                             MORIARTY
               You wager?

               A better word.     I sincerely hope
               it's accurate.

                                IRENE
               I --

     Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.


34   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            34

     A rough-looking BEGGAR wearing an eye patch has fallen
     under a wheel of the coach.

                             COACH DRIVER
               You fell right into the carriage!

     The Beggar is up, limping toward the window where
     Moriarty and Irene sit. He has disgusting blackened
     teeth.

                             BEGGAR

               way, yes it would, sir.

     He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
     Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears,
     delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).

     The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of
     the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the
     Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.


35   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT                         35

     Holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side
     of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.
     Watson approaches, very concerned, almost enraged.

                             WATSON
               Look at you, I can't believe you                           
               ran after her like a schoolboy                             
               again. Leaping about, all                                  
               aflutter. Are you a masochist?                             

                             HOLMES
               Allow me to explain.                                       

                             WATSON
               Don't you remember what she did to                         
               you? She turned you inside out,                            
               she made a proper idiot of you.                            
               I'm sorry, you were going to                               
               explain something...

               No, I don't agree. It's more than

       Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK
       of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW.

36     FLASHBACK - INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT           36

       We see Irene step out.

                                IRENE
                  Why don't I see myself out.

       Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
       looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
       down an alley. He bolts    into --


36A    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - CORRIDOR                               36A

       He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can
       speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other
       end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to --


37     EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - REAR YARD                               37

       Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
       roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing
       prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself
       down with a determined look. He lands just right.


37A-37D OMITTED                                               37A-37D

38    EXT. COAL SHED                                                 38

      Holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block
      over from Baker Street.


38A   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            38A

      He runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same
      alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other
      side.

                                                          CUT TO:


      HOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY

      from concealment:    Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A
      BUNCH OF ROSES.

                                 MAN WITH ROSES
                   Got some roses for you,
                   sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos
                   you're so pretty.

                                 IRENE
                   Oh, how nice of you.

      Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no
      woman in her right mind would go down this alley.

38B                                                                 38B
      INT. ALLEY
      The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another
      man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
      grab her --

      -- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
      the chin, dropping him immediately.

      Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
      against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.

      Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
      knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
      his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her
      own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys,
      eyes bulging.

      Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
      There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B
                              IRENE
                Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look
                like yours, does it? And --
                naughty boy -- here's another
                one. I'll return them, shall I?

      She takes both wallets, takes the roses --

                              IRENE
                These are lovely, thank you.

      -- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on
      the floor.

      On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too,
      then leaves.

                                                           CUT TO:


      ANGLE ON HOLMES

                              HOLMES
                Now, that's the Irene I know.

      He hurries after Irene down the alley.

38C                                                                  38C
      EXT. LONDON STREET
      Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
      through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.

      Holmes picks up the pace.

      He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
      hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
      and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

      He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
      on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
      it to blacken his teeth.

      He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a
      fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on.


39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39

      Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he
      stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this
      time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the
      other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.

                                                      37B.


40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40

     Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.

     Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.                       

                             HOLMES
               This man intrigues me, Watson.                            
               He's got Adler on edge.                                   

                             WATSON
               Which is no mean feat.                                    

                             HOLMES                                      
               She's intimidated, scared...                              

                             WATSON                                      
               And yet she works for him. That's                         
               bad money. It's nothing to do                             
               with me, but leave this case.                             

     Holmes motions to the bills.

                             HOLMES
               Well, I may not have a choice. A                          
               man has to make a living. After                           
               all, I'll be paying the rent                              
               entirely on my own.                                       

                             WATSON                                      
               You know what, I've had just about                        
               enough --

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Mister Holmes, sir...?

     He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door.
     Breathless, pale, scared.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Inspector Lestrade asks that you
               come with me, at once.

               What's he done now, lost his way
               to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a
               compass. You means us.

               It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It                     
               appears he's come back from the                  
               dead.

                             WATSON                             
               Well that's clever seeing as how I               
               pronounced him dead myself.

               A groundsman saw him walking                     
               through the graves, just this
               morning.

                             WATSON
               I'll leave this one in your                      
               capable hands. I have tea with                   
               Mary and her parents this evening.               

     Watson walks into his office.                              

                             HOLMES
               It is not my reputation at stake                 
               here.                                            

                             WATSON                             
               Are you taking this seriously?                   

                             HOLMES                             
               Like it or not, it's a matter of                 
               professional integrity. No girl                  
               wants to marry a doctor who can't                
               tell if a man's dead or not.                     

     They all move to the exit.                                 

                             HOLMES                             
               Watson, you'd do well to hide your               
               medical certificates in case                     
               they're revoked.                                 

     Clarky laughs.

41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41

     Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money,
     and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes
     and Watson forward.


42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42

     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble
     memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a
     bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.

     A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and
     Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS
     KIT.

     They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family
     Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground
     while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump
     of trees in the distance.

                             WATSON
               Look at this mess. Nothing but
               standard-issue police bootprints.
               Any possible evidence there might
               have been has been trampled.

               Scotland Yard at their finest,
               once again.

     Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
     They'd rather be anywhere but here.

     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors
     of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.
     Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is
     interesting.

     Lestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
     it off.

                             LESTRADE
               Look at those slabs of marble --
               they're half a ton each if they're
               a pound -- smashed outward like
               they were nothing.

     On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'
     handkerchief.

                             LESTRADE
               Explain it if you can, Holmes.

     Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He
     notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.

                             HOLMES
               And the coffin?

                             LESTRADE
               We're digging it up now. The
               witness is over there. You can
               question him if you like -- but
               you won't get much.

     The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of
     the rain under an ancient cypress tree.

     Watson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite
     direction.

     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
     each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
     Holmes or Watson to hear this.

                             LESTRADE
                    (low, angry)
               If you lot don't stop behaving
               like a bunch of superstitious milk
               maids, you're on double-time!
               You're an embarrassment! Also,
               you're forbidden to talk about
               this to anyone, not a word. Are
               we bloody clear on that?

     The cops nod, duly chastened.

                                                         CUT TO:

     THE GROUNDSKEEPER

     mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson
     immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse,
     looking in his eyes.

     The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a
     boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth
     and gently sits him down.

     Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.

                                WATSON
               He's in shock.     We should give him
               a few moments.

     Lestrade stomps up.

                              LESTRADE
               The witness stated that he saw
               Lord Blackwood rise from the
               grave.
                     (at Watson,
                      accusingly)
               Well? You pronounced the man
               dead.

                             WATSON
                    (stung)
               He had no pulse.
                             HOLMES
               Inspector, do you know if this is
               a spruce or a sycamore?

     Lestrade shakes his head.    It hasn't been a good day for
     him, or the Yard.

     There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
     been extracted from the crypt.

     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing
     themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes
     chuckles.

                                LESTRADE
               OPEN IT!!

     But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if
     it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches
     forward --

     -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and
     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.

     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.

     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
     coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,
     in everyday clothes, with red hair.

                             LESTRADE
               That's not Blackwood.

                              HOLMES
               Now that we have a firm grasp of
               the obvious...

     Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver
     tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.

                             WATSON
               Lividity is late stage. Diptera
               deposits are approximately --
                    (measuring)
               -- three quarters of an inch,
               putting the time of death at ten
               to twelve hours ago.

                             HOLMES
               Inspector, may I see your pen?

     Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
     Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
     revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.

                             WATSON
               Missing two incisors in the upper
               jaw...
                    (a look at Holmes)
               Adler's midget.

     Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
     pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.

                             HOLMES
               All yours, Inspector.

     Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
     it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
     small measure of revenge.

       Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
       Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty
       pocket watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Scratches around the keyhole where
                 the watch is wound. Most drunks
                 are the same, and pawnbrokers
                 scratch the ticket number and
                 their initials inside the lid.
                 This one has five, so the owner --

                               GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)
                 He was walking.

       They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in
       front of them, ready to unburden himself.

                               GROUNDSKEEPER
                      (quivering voice)
                 He was walking but his feet didn't
                 touch the ground. And I'm not
                 daft, I know what I saw and I know
                 Lord Blackwood. He was as alive
                 as you or me. It's not right.
                 It's not natural.
                      (turns, leaves)
                 Our Father Who art in heaven...
                 (etc.)

       All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust
       of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out
       of there.

                               HOLMES
                 Now the game is afoot, Watson.

       Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly
       observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes
       a bundle wrapped in newspaper.

                               WATSON
                 I fail to see how these fish and
                 chips are different from the three
                 other places we passed along the
                 way.

                                  HOLMES
                 Trust me.

               Just eat.

     Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along.
     Watson appears preoccupied.

                             WATSON
               You know, I've seen things in war
               that I couldn't explain. I once
               heard a man predict his death,
               down to the number and placement
               of the bullet holes that killed
               him. You have to admit that a
               supernatural explanation is at
               least theoretically possible.

                     indecipherable)
               Never theorize before you have
               data. Invariably, you end up
               twisting facts to suit theories,
               instead of theories to suit facts.
               Adler's midget is the key to this.

     Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his
     eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the
     lid.

                             HOLMES
               Hmm... scratches around the
               keyhole, what does that tell you?

                             WATSON
               The owner was most likely a drunk.
               Each time he wound the watch his
               hand would slip, hence the
               scratches.

                             HOLMES
               Very good, Watson! You've
               developed considerable powers of
               your own.

     Watson looks quite chuffed.

                             HOLMES
               Let's see now, there are several
               sets of initials scored into the
               lid.

                             WATSON
               Pawnbroker's marks.

                               HOLMES
               Excellent.

     Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they
     turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A
     PAWN SHOP. His face falls.

                             HOLMES
               The most recent is M.H...

     Watson shakes his head.

                             WATSON
               Maddison and Haig.

               Oh my Lord, here we are. They
               should give us an address.

     WE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE,
     DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street.

                             WATSON
               There's one thing you've missed.
               On the watch.

                                HOLMES
               I think not.

                             WATSON
               The time. Which leads me to
               deduce that I'm already late for
               my appointment with Mary. You
               remember, the one I was leaving
               for before you talked me into
               coming to dig up dead bodies with
               you.

     A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to
     leave.

                             PALM READER
               Reckon your future, sir?

                             HOLMES
               Perhaps we do need a little help
               from the beyond.

                                WATSON
               No, thank you.

     She grabs his hand anyway.

                             PALM READER
               You need to hear what I have to
               tell you.

     Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of
     her tone that he doesn't pull away.

                             PALM READER
               I see two men, brothers. Not in
               blood but in bond. I see the
               letters S and an L, no... wait, a
               J.

     Holmes and Watson look at each other.   She has their
     attention.

     Watson looks at Holmes.

                             PALM READER
               I see a letter... the letter M...

                    (horrified)
               Patterned table clothes, china
               figurines, lace doilies...

     Watson snatches his hand away.

                             WATSON
               You think you are clever don't
               you?

     Holmes feigns innocence.

                             PALM READER
               She turns to fat...

                                WATSON
               Enough.

     The Palm Reader looks at Holmes.

                             HOLMES
                    (to Watson)
               Do you have any changes?

     Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.

                             WATSON
               This is a new low -- even for you.

               It's the most honest prediction
               old Flora has made in years. And
               you know it yourself, Watson.
               That is precisely the reason you
               can't find a suitable ring.
               You're terrified of a life without
               the thrill of the macabre, as well
               you should be.

     Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the
     wrapping aside, pleased with himself.

                             WATSON
               Do you still have my cut from the
               fight?

     Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.

                                HOLMES
               Why, do you --

     Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.

     Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window:
     "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."

     Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows
     Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs
     his arm.

                             PALM READER
               I seen something in his hand.
               Darkness and great pain. Mortal
               peril. Warn your friend, he's not
               safe.

     Even Holmes is taken aback by this.

     EXT. LONDON EAST END - MINUTES LATER
     Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
     behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not.
     Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.

                                WATSON
               Not bad, eh?

     Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from
     the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.

     windows are boarded up.

     Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky
     stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.

     Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock.
     It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a
     better angle with the knife.

     CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the
     door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he
     gestures them inside.

                             WATSON
               I can spare ten minutes.

     INT. REORDON'S ROOMS - DAY
     The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
     Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior
     that stops them both in their tracks:

     From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in
     writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper
     and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the
     plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and
     collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.

                             HOLMES
               He clearly felt something was
               coming to get him.

                                WATSON
               Something did.

     They move further inside where there is a hallway and a
     basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.

               Watson, come take a look at this --

     Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...


56   INT. REORDON'S LAB                                            56

     Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.

                              WATSON
                    (reeling)
               Bloody hell...

     The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific
     and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a
     distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs
     and matter float in jars.

                             HOLMES
                    (inhaling deeply,
                     loving it)
               Ammonium sulfate.

     In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An
     experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud
     of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:

     DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies
     frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.

     Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid
     perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.

                             HOLMES
                    (mumbles)

               Appears he was attempting to
               follow occult formula with
               scientific practice.

     Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS.
     He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the
     rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.

     Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.

                             WATSON
               Has he any hydrochloric acid?

     Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
     Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another
     chemical on a clean sheet of paper.

     Holmes senses something, moves into the next room.       He
     stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:

                              HOLMES
                Irene was here.

     Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt
     paper.

                              WATSON
                Why would she hire you to find
                him, if she planned to do the job
                herself?

                              HOLMES
                Maybe it's not the man she's
                after, but something else.
                Something he was working on?
                              WATSON
                Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron
                right out of the ink. Long as
                it's not too burnt...

     Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the
     lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page.
     Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.

                              WATSON
                He worked for Blackwood.

     Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow.       He
     starts walking back to the other room.

                              HOLMES
                There's one odor I can't put my
                finger on. Sweet, almost like
                perfume... or sugar....

     They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
     seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
     deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a
     twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).

     They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes'
     eyes widen at the giant.

                             HOLMES
               Hello, gentlemen.

     Dredger is deadpan.

                             DREDGER
               Sherlock Holmes.

                             HOLMES
               Let me guess -- you're here to
               extinguish any connection between
               the man who lived here and the man
               you work for? Curious you'd still
               be running errands for a dead man.

                             DREDGER
                    (smiles)
               You do like to talk.

     The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.

                             HOLMES
               You take them, I'll handle Mr.
               Sweet tooth.

                             WATSON
               Seems about fair.

     Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging
     at them. As they dodge and swing back --

     Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
     a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
     dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
     CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:

     He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
     heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
     so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.

     He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
     face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --

     Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his
     arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air,
     sending him flying into --

      Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the
      bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his
      senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --

      Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head
      butting one, kicking the other in the groin.

      The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
      flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
      his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --

      The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
      accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.

      As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
      HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
      which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
      fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.

      INT. REORDON'S LAB
      Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for
      some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a
      SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.

      Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft
      desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.

      ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an
      ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --

      Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement
      ring off the floor, just as --

      Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson,
      knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.

      Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by
      the efficacy of the weapon.

      Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes
      cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.

      Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on
      the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other
      end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!

      The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS
      Dredger back twenty more feet.

        Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts
        running for it, frantic as --

        Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks
        at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.

        Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as
        he's about to grab it...

        THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.

        Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the
        window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --

        Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson
        picks up the ring, sees:

        The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the
        floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson
        darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

        Dredger runs down the street, knocking people out of his
        way. Holmes gives chase, darting around people, trailing
        Dredger through the gates of a huge commercial
        shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as --

        Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the
        UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far
        from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed
        to see it smoothly into water.


63      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY                          63

        For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the
        whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back
        around the shed that they just ran through.

        Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this
        network of struts. They weave through the shadows.

        Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He
        takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and --

      ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with
      the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes
      gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.

      Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches
      out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile.
      A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:

      The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the
      rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --

      Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at
      Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing
      others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.


64    EXT. FABRICATION SHED - DAY                                  64

      Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes
      scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in
      pursuit.

      A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.   Dredger turns
      for a moment, just long enough for --

      Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down
      onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.

      Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins
      him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering
      another chock. It's the last straw for the support
      mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.

64B   EXT. FABRICATION SHED                                       64B

      Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and
      Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship
      EXPLODE BACKWARDS --

      -- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding
      down towards them.

      Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --

      backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down
      with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.

      Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his
      head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.

      The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against
      the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into
      consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over
      him. He's doomed. And...

      The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He
      opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself
      in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his
      nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't
      know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --

      EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
      We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the
      half-launched ship.

      The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle
      and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.

      A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...

      The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again,
      falling through the air --
      Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the
      air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a
      sound like the side of the world being torn off --

      -- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a
      vast, frothy explosion of water.

      Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
      river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds.
      A quiet beat.

      Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing
      into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet,
      but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of
      him and he sags back to the ground.

      Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back
      to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they
      find:

      The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene.
      They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and
      Watson.

      Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.


67    INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING                                    67

      The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade
      and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.

      Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's
      sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot
      eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change
      here and there.

      Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking
      his head.

                               WATSON
                 I haven't slept all night. I
                 deserve this... I clearly deserve
                 it. How could I ever be so
                 deluded as to believe I could meet
                 Mary's parents for tea once I let
                 myself be talked into going with
                 you. Now of course I'm in jail.

      Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him
      enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's
      handkerchief.

                 I've used the time to review my

     Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
     looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.

                             HOLMES
               Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
               most dangerous man in London.

     Watson snaps at the man.

                             WATSON
               Who could forget that face? I

               in two weeks. Now, if you'll

     Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and

     lack of understanding.

               What you need is a rest. You and
               I could go out to the countryside.
               My brother Mycroft has a small
               estate near Chichester. It has

               If I were going to the country, I
               would be going with my future
               wife --

                             HOLMES
               Certainly. We should have her
               along. Let's get Gladstone out of
               the house as well.

                             WATSON
               No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her.
               You're not --

                             HOLMES
               Invited? Now you're not making
               any sense, Watson. Why would I
               not be invited to my own brother's
               country home?

                     head)
               ... without this.

     He touches his own heart.   They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the
     bars.

                              PRISON GUARD
               John Watson?   You made bail.

     Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps
     forward. But the Guard shakes his head.

                              PRISON GUARD
               Just Watson.

     As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from
     behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between
     Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --

     -- he leaves.

     Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
     She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
     The bars slide shut.

     The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

     having just been battered through it by Holmes.

               Lestrade -- your usual impeccable

     Holmes and Lestrade march along. Lestrade holds out a
     copy of the newspaper. The headline reads: "BLACKWOOD
     LIVES AND THE DEVIL WALKS WITH HIM! MURDERER
     RESURRECTED!"

                             LESTRADE

               All in good time.

                             LESTRADE
               We don't have time. I've an
               office full of policemen hanging
               crosses over their desks. A
               public that's working itself into
               a frenzy...
     Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open.

                              HOLMES
               Who's this?

                             LESTRADE
               Try to behave yourself. They just
               paid a small fortune to bail you

     He holds a black hood.   Holmes shrugs.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.


     FADE IN:

72   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS                         72

     The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.

                              SIR THOMAS
                Mr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.

                              HOLMES
                As to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the
                carriage forked left, then right,
                a bump over the Fleet conduit --
                need I go on?

     Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.

                              HOLMES
                As to who you are -- that took
                every ounce of my not-
                inconsiderable experience and
                skill... the letters on your desk
                are addressed to Sir Thomas
                Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
                That would be your official title.
                Who you realy are is another
                matter entirely.

     Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
     on a roll.

               Judging by the sacred Ox on your
               ring, you're also the secret head
               of the Temple of the Four Orders --
               in whose headquarters we now
               stand, on the northwest corner of
               St. James Square.
                    (beat)
               And as to the mystery -- the
               mystery is why you bothered to
               blindfold me in the first place.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Yes, well, it's standard
               procedure, I suppose.

     Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
     on their part.

                             STANDISH (O.S.)
               I think we have the right man.

     Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

               Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador
               Standish from America and Lord
               Coward, the Home Secretary.

     Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter.    He
     isn't impressed by rank.

                             LORD COWARD
               I suppose you already have some
               notion as to the -- practices of
               our Order?

                              HOLMES
               Yes.   They're almost interesting.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Be as skeptical as you like -- but
               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good
               for centuries. The danger is that
               they can also be exploited for
               more nefarious purposes.

                             LORD COWARD
               What some call the dark arts, or
               practical magic.

     Holmes looks around the room, sees FLAGS on the walls
     with ancient symbols, variations of the SPHINX.

                             STANDISH
               We know you're are a rationalist.
               We don't ask you to share our
               faith, only our fears.

                             HOLMES
               Fear is the more infectious
               condition.
                    (at Sir Thomas)
               In this case, fear of your own
               child.

     That shocks them rigid.

                             HOLMES
               Blackwood is your son, yes? You
               have the same colored irises -- a

                      Thomas' ear)
               -- plus identical outer ears, or
               pinna, which only pass down
               through the direct bloodline,
               which would make you either
               brothers, or, more likely, father
               and son.

     Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
     conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
     especially shaken.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Very few people are privy to that
               information, and we want to keep
               it that way.

     Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.

                             SIR THOMAS
               He was conceived during one of our
               rituals. His mother wasn't my
               wife, but she shared our beliefs.
               She was a powerful practitioner.
               Though not enough to survive
               giving birth to him.

     Holmes is appalled and shows it.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We were young. It was before we
               fully understood the powers we
               were dealing with.

                             HOLMES
               Evidently.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Death followed him wherever he
               went, from his birth to arms he
               made and sold. What family he had
               tended to... not survive. No one
               could prove anything of course,
               but we all knew --

     Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
     1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
     a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

                             SIR THOMAS
               The boy was a curse. I didn't
               have the courage either to take
               him in or to --

               All this is history. The present
               and future are worse.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We've done our best to stop him
               ourselves, but it's not enough.

                             LORD COWARD
               His power grows daily and
               exponentially. His resurrection
               is evidence of that. What he does
               next will be far more dangerous --

                             SIR THOMAS
               -- he's going to raise a force
               that will alter the very course of
               our world. We need you to find
               him and stop him before he does.

                             LORD COWARD
               We'll give you any assistance we
               can. As Home Secretary, I have
               considerable influence over the
               police.
                    (beat)
               Name your price.

     Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.

                             HOLMES
               One of the great benefits of my
               work is that I can pick and choose
               my clients. I'll get him, but not
               for you.

     Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir
     Thomas with a very bleak gaze.

                             HOLMES
               I have one last question, Sir
               Thomas.

                             SIR THOMAS
               What is it?

     Holmes holds up the tintype.

                             HOLMES
               If the rest of his family's dead,
               why are you still alive?

     Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves.

     Holmes comes out of a carriage, and scoots up the steps
     of the massive hotel that's bustling with people.


75   INT. IRENE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                               75

     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy

               If you're going to watch me take
               my clothes off, Sherlock, the
               least you can do is help me with
               the buttons.

     OR ALT:

                             IRENE
               To watch a lady undress without
               her permission is a criminal
               offense, Sherlock, and could get
               you into a lot of trouble...

     They both eye the Derringer on the table.

                             IRENE
               So why don't you come over here
               and help me instead.

     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
     for the top button on the back of her dress.

                                IRENE
               That's better.

                             HOLMES
               You can stop looking for Reardon.

                             IRENE
               I knew I could count on you.

               He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.

     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.

                             IRENE
               Wonderful. Case closed then.
               Your services are no longer
               required.

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.

                             HOLMES
               I can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.
               I couldn't see his face, but I
               spotted chalk on his lapel. A
               professor perhaps?

     Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

                             IRENE
                    (behind screen)
               The eye patch was a nice touch.

                             HOLMES
               But I've never known a professor
               to carry a gun, and on such a
               clever contraption.

                             IRENE (O.S.)
               Let's not argue.

                             HOLMES
               We're not.

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.

                             HOLMES
               Tell me who you're working for and
               what he's after.

                             IRENE
               That's nobody's business but my
               own.

                             HOLMES
               I disagree.

                             IRENE
               You see, we are arguing.

     Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
     case vehemently.

                             HOLMES
               When a man you ask me to find ends
               up dead in the coffin of the most
               notorious murderer since Jack the
               Ripper and that murderer manages
               to return from the dead, not only
               is it my business, it's the
               business of Scotland Yard and the
               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in
               relation to a crime of this
               magnitude would certainly mean
               prison time.

                             IRENE
               This wine is excellent.    You
               should really try some.

     Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
     wine bottle.

                             HOLMES
               So what's it to be?

                             IRENE
               Do we really have to decide now?

     Irene reaches for the wine.

                             HOLMES
               You're in over your head this
               time, Irene.

     Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm.

     BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
     Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
     him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
     Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
     disarms Holmes.

     The kiss leads them to the bed.

               That's better.

     Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist.

     CLICK!

     Holmes' eyes flare with surprise.

     CLICK!

                                IRENE
               Much better.

     Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.

                             IRENE
               This is the only way it could ever
               work between us, Sherlock -- one
               in shackles, the other with the
               key.

     She gets off him.

     While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
     across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
     She's in charge now.

                             IRENE
               I've NEVER been in over my head.

                             HOLMES
               How can you live like this --
               always a fugitive.

     She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.

                             IRENE
               But free. And on my own terms.
               Just like you -- well, not you at
               this exact moment --

      She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the
      handcuff keys down there.

                              IRENE
                -- but generally speaking.

      Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his
      neck, moves to the doorway.

                              IRENE
                If anyone asks, please let them
                know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have
                time to check out.
                      (beat)

      His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.

                              PERIGRINE
                Good evening, sir. Some figs and
                honey with a nice glass of port?
                I've prepared a tray.

                              SIR THOMAS
                No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going
                to bed.
                     (as he heads
                      upstairs)
                You won't let those figs go to

     Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing.

     The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.

     The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is
     magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic,
     as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of
     wind.

     Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.
     Can't. Not all the way.

                Hello, Father...

      Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the
      corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.

      Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck
      as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.

                              BLACKWOOD
                You can't fight it. It comes from
                a power greater than yours. You
                can only surrender.

      The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps
      closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've been imagining this moment
                for a long time...

      The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at
      Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.

                              BLACKWOOD
                ... I must admit, it's better than
                I thought it would be.

      handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her
      shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts
      with shock, then grim recognition sets in.

      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                We've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --
      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                     (realizing Holmes
                      isn't there)
                -- only his ring was missing.

      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

                Why did you drain the water?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                Out of common decency.

                              HOLMES
                     (incensed)
                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.

                                HOLMES
                Hmm...

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

                What is that?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                     (smelling)
                Uhhhh... jasmine?

                              HOLMES
                Superb. I suspect this comes from
                a larger cannister. It'll either
                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen
                closet with a vent. And,
                Constable, you could check the
                ground under the rear windows for
                any footprints not your own.

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.

                              HOLMES
                Data, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

      Holmes is happy.

      He glances around the room, sees the chair where
      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

      His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He
      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.
      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM
      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

      FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels.

      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to
      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --

78E   INT. SIR THOMAS' SECRET ROOM                                  78E

      Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient
      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of
      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --

      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
      paper, just as --

      -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer
      proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.

      They are startled by the secret room --

      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes
      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.

      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.
                                 HOLMES
                      (vis   the secret room)
                I have no    idea what to make of
                that.

      Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door            
      open. He is well into packing his things. The office is              
      full of boxes, the walls and shelves are very sparse.

               Don't forget the wallpaper.

               There isn't any.

               Figure of speech.                                      

     Holmes steps into the room.

               use, do you mind if I employ it?

     Holmes steps aside. Two/three policemen enter carrying a         
     large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on Watson's         
     desktop. They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of

               consolation in the knowledge that                       
               he can still be of service to his                       
               fellow men.                                             

     Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body,
     starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and
     forearms of his coat.

     Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from             
     Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches          
     them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.

               Elbows and arms stained with
               blood, but older than his own
               injuries. Plenty of it, layer on
               layer...

     Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife,
     examines it.

                             HOLMES
               Though none of it human.

     Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to
     resist the mystery, but it's not easy.

                             HOLMES
               A butcher perhaps...?   What else?

     Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies
     the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his
     nose at the smell.

                             HOLMES
               Hm -- predominantly yellow flame,
               but with distinct green bursts.
               Sulfurous. He spent lots of time
               around industrial work and very
               little around a wash basin.

     Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under
     the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his
     fingers like a connoisseur.

                             HOLMES
               Coal... river silt...

     Watson slows down further, struggling.

                             HOLMES
               That plus the river silt and
               industrial slag on his trousers
               puts him squarely in...

     A hanging beat.   And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:

               Nine Elms.

                             HOLMES
               Well done. Now, you didn't happen
               to pack the Lord's Register of
               members' interests, did you?

     Watson pulls it out of a box.

     As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on

        A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.

        A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up,
        moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...

        Holmes' PISTOL.

        He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he
        becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to
        himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving
        look.

                  Yes, I know. Don't give me that
                  look, Gladstone.

        He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.

      A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
      by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.

      He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs
      on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally
      opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him,
      gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.

                immediately, I nominate Lord
                Blackwood as head of the Order.

                              STANDISH
                Are you mad, Coward? Have you any
                idea what he's capable of?

                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
                Of course he does. It's why he's
                here.

      Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
      come back more powerful than ever.

      The crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward,
      betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by
      the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I am humbled. I am honored.
                     (beat)
                My powers and my assets --
                munitions, shipping, industry --
                they were given to me for a
                purpose.

                             BLACKWOOD (CONT'D)
               A magnificent and simple purpose.
               A different future... a future
               ruled by us.

     Blackwood stands, prowls.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You've made policy in secret for
               centuries. Now, you'll make it
               openly.

     The men are beginning to like what they hear.

                             BLACKWOOD
               The first act is a necessary one,
               for without death there can be no
               rebirth...
                    (beat)
               ... at noon tomorrow, we will take
               the first step towards a new
               chapter in history.
                    (beat)
               England will know our power.
               Then, the whole world will.
               Across the Atlantic lies a colony
               that was once ours, and will be
               again. Their civil war weakened
               them; their government is as
               corrupt and ineffective as ours.
               We'll take it from them.
                    (beat)
               With their resources and our
               power, we'll remake the world,
               we'll create the future.
                    (beat)
               Are you with me?

                             STANDISH
               No, sir, we are not!
                    (turning to the
                     others)
               The powers he's playing with are
               beyond any man's control.

                              BLACKWOOD
               They're limitless -- even death
               holds no sway.

                             STANDISH
               Help me stop him before it's too
               late.

     Nobody moves.   Blackwood smiles -- he's won.

      In desperation, Standish pulls a gun.   But as he aims it
      at Blackwood -

                              BLACKWOOD
                I wouldn't do that.

      -- he IGNITES, combusting with an impossible BLAST OF
      BLINDING HOT FLAMES!

      The men in the room reel backwards, shocked, terrified.

      Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a
      window out to --


83A   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                     83A

      The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city
      blocks. People look up, gape, and --

      WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage.
      Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.

      The flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts,
      melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross
      themselves, as they witness this unnatural act.

      Blackwood turns to Coward, nods.

      Coward produces a brimming silver chalice.

                              BLACKWOOD
                Come, drink your allegiance here.

      The members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't
      taste good, but it tastes like power. As they drink,
      Blackwood leans close to Coward:

      Coward nods.


84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84

      An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
      stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
      the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
      FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.

      Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
      distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
      decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
      VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
      in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.

                              HOLMES
                Everything all right, Captain
                Tanner?

      Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.

                              TANNER
                Just a little leak, nothing to
                worry about.

      Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very
      serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.

                              TANNER
                Not a great one for the water, are
                you, doctor? Army type, aren't
                you? You wouldn't have lasted
                long in the Navy.

      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                That's as far as we can go.

      Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed.

                              WATSON
                There must be fifty yards of mud
                out there.

      Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the
      prow. He whispers at Tanner.

               Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the
               police when you get there.

     Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears.
     Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,
     watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.

                             WATSON
               I know precisely how much money is
               in there.

                             TANNER
                    (taking the piss)
               I am sure you do, doctor.

     Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking
     stick.

86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86

     Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in
     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'
     GUN.
                             HOLMES
               What are you doing with my gun?

                             WATSON
               Oh, please.

                             HOLMES
               It was an honest mistake --

                             WATSON
               There was nothing honest about it.

     Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,
     the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps
     forward.

                             WATSON
               Come on, let's get this over with.

     They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
     whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.

                             HOLMES
               The one on the left seems more
               attentive, might prove easily
               distracted. The big one's been
               drinking -- whether for courage or
               from habit... Watson?

     Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.

     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

     stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up,
     passing Watson into --


89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89

     Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a
     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
     through it.

     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:

                             HOLMES
               They cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.

                              WATSON (O.S.)
               Holmes.   You need to see this.

     Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
     doors.

     TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
     stepping into --


90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90

     A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.

                               WATSON
               One-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.

                             HOLMES
               It's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               `And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.
                              BLACKWOOD
                I cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.

                             BLACKWOOD
               I want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
     the trigger. Click. Misfire.

                help, Holmes, I have a gift for
                you.

      Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.

                              BLACKWOOD
                     (voice moving away)
                She followed you. You led your
                little lamb straight to slaughter.

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.

      Decision time.

90A                                                                90A

      Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
      gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
      conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
      line towards the flames.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.

                              HOLMES
                It's your turn in shackles this
                time.

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.

                But this time no key,
                unfortunately.

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.

                              HOLMES
                I've been meaning to ask you
                something --

                              IRENE
                Well, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.

      She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
      moving sideways, keeping pace with her.

                              IRENE
                     (trying her best not
                      to show the strain)
                You had a question.

      Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
      various obstacles --

                              HOLMES
                     (same)
                Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
                you're not in over your head?

                              IRENE
                     (panting)
                In some countries steam is
                considered excellent therapy for
                the skin.

      -- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
      jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.

      Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
      again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.

      When Holmes has Irene stable again:

                              IRENE
                     (weakly)
                I have to say -- it's overrated.

      Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
      yelling at him.

      Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
      and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
      belt.

      Watson points at the I-beam running above them.   Holmes
      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      -- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.

      Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She
      swings off the I-beam, through the air --



                                                    (CONTINUED)

      -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
      NEW PROP!)

      Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
      LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.

      Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
      moving towards the giant band saw.

      Shit a brick.

                              IRENE
                Sherlock?

      Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
      himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
      might --

      -- smashes the shackle lock.

      Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
      right hand.

      The bandsaw whines viciously.

      Irene swings aside, just misses it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      Gets a free haircut.

      Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
      can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
      shackles).

      Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

      Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

      -- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
      in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.

      Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
      looking for Blackwood.

      Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --

                              IRENE
                Thank you so much. I owe you.

      -- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes
      grabs her, stops her.

                              HOLMES
                You owe me information.
                     (angry)
                No more games, Irene.

      She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
      at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:

                              IRENE
                Blackwood's manufactured large-
                scale weapons for years. Lately
                there've been rumors of something
                new. More powerful than anything
                else. And... magical. My job is
                to find out if the rumors are
                true.

                I would say they are.

      And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails
      her, processing. They blast through the doors to --


91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91

      Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock.
      He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
      the darkness.

      Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
      Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
      on the planks:

      Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes
      it.

                                HOLMES
                Watson!

      Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected
      to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a
      trap and turns back to warn the others --

                                WATSON
                Holmes...

      A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM!

      The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding
      conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights
      up all of London.

                              HOLMES
                WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!

      Holmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the
      barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them --
      it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
      knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris.

      Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
      debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
      knocking him to the ground.

      He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
      exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --
      BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them
      down, but to safety.

      As he opens his eyes --

     We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
     Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared.
     Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --

     -- is intercepted by Constable Clark.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               There's an order for your arrest
               all the way from the top, sir --
               so you'll have to hit me now.

                             HOLMES
               From Lord Coward?

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Yes, sir, so make it look good.

                             HOLMES
               Thank you, Clarky.

     Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps
     him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his
     escape fast.

     Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

     Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor.
     One reads the paper. The headline: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR

     Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away
     tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The
     two coppers nod respectfully.
     Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room,
     reaches for the handle, pauses.

     THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR,
     studying Watson's chart.

     Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

     The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
     him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

                             WATSON
               What are you administering?

               Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for
               the pain.

     Watson looks at his wounded shoulder.

                             DOCTOR
               There are four pieces of shrapnel.
               The surgeon should be along
               shortly.

     Watson tries to sit up again.

     This reveals that Mary has entered the room, stands back
     respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.

                             WATSON
               Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?

                             DOCTOR
               They're near the carotid artery.

               Get a mirror, I'll extract them
               myself.

               I can't authorize that, Doctor.
               We must first manage the pain and
               combat the infection.

                             WATSON
               I haven't time for that.   My

       ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
       Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
       an overhead railway.

       We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
       splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
       hospital is slumped down against the wall.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

       Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.

     Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               And now it dawns on you, you begin
               to recognize your part in his
               play.

     Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
     within the outer circle of flame.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You see the path he chose for you.

     Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

                 Didn't you wonder why it was so
                 easy to catch me? I told you I
                 needed five lives for my
                 resurrection. Why would I take a
                 sixth under St. Paul's?

     Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Unless I simply wanted to be
                 caught by the great Sherlock
                 Holmes...

     Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at
     Holmes' head.

                 ... so I could die on the biggest
                 stage of all. You made me what I

     We see --

     as Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes'
     head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react --

     WHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME --

     The sun is rising.   Holmes' eyes open and we see:

     WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is
     sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared.

                              HOLMES
                     (confused)
                Watson...?

     Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man?
     He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.

                              WATSON
                Interesting artwork.   You look
                bloody awful.

     He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly
     alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
     is in a sling. He's been through it.

     In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.

                              HOLMES
                What about the shrapnel in your
                arm?

     Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel --

                              WATSON
                Took it out myself. Mary said I
                had a lousy doctor.

                              WATSON
                Yes, oddly, it seems she might
                understand the power of
                partnership.

     They both look back over to Irene who just finished
     loading her gun. The coffee seems ready so she pours a
     cup.

     Irene walks over and hands Holmes the cup.

               Thank you. You know, I dreamt
               that you were strangling me.

               out to settle down.

     Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle
     now comes from upstairs.

     The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy
     getting drunk with the money he has acquired.

     Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of
     him, sits opposite him with the other.

     Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion.
     Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
     then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

               Oh, I poisoned that one.

      it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he
      STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor.

      Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
      observed over the course of the investigation.

      He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
      Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
      ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
      Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
      ring.

      Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
      flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

      Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
      he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
      question mark. Where? Who?

      Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang
      as if willing the flashes to come.

      Holmes is excited, electric.

                              HOLMES
                Now that you're sitting
                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the
                crypt... with a few enhancements
                of my own.

                But I have emerged enlightened...
                The fraternity who silently
                control the Empire, share the
                belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
                and Emperors of old that the
                Sphinx was a door to another
                dimension, a gateway to
                immeasurable power --

      He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
      covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
      Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.

                              HOLMES
                In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
                found the bone of an ox, the tooth
                of a lion, the feather of an
                eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

      Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
      now.

                              HOLMES
                Now, it is a widely held belief
                that within the architecture of
                the great cities are coded
                references to this system.

      He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
      cross...

      Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
      draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
      through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
      floor.

                              HOLMES
                Since he rose from the grave,
                Blackwood has killed three men.
                Each murder was committed at a
                location that has a direct
                connection with the Temple,
                therefore the System.
                     (beat)
                Reordon, the ginger midget,
                represents Man. We found his body
                here...

      He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
      corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
      that has the hair (6 o'clock).

                              HOLMES
                Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
                Temple, wore the ox ring... he
                died here...

      Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
      river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
      the ox bone (12 o'clock).

                Standish was Ambassador to
                America, where the Eagle has been
                the national emblem for over a
                hundred years -- and not by
                coincidence.

      Holmes points to the map.

                              HOLMES
                The headquarters of Temple of the
                Four Orders where he died is
                here...

      He points to corresponding points on the map and on the
      cross.

                              WATSON
                Man, Ox, Eagle...

      He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points
      of a cross.

                              WATSON
                And last on the list:    the Lion.
      Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene
      step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the
      map...

                              HOLMES
                Correspondingly, the map will tell
                us the location of Blackwood's
                final act. Right here.

      Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing.

                What is the meaning of this
                circle?

      Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the
      point at which the other four come together. They look
      to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in
      the middle of the river.

                              HOLMES
                It is the fifth element -- the
                ethereal. That which can't yet be
                known.

                 It's right in the middle of the
                 River Thames.

       BOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing.
       Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding
       the pub.

                                 IRENE
                 Police.

       Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson.
       He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it
       open.

                                 HOLMES
                 Ladies first.

       Irene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down.

                               HOLMES
                 Follow these plans.

       Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to
       join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room.
       Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.

102A                                                               102A
       INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - HALL
       Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the
       door EXPLODES inward. Police fill the hall. Holmes
       looks back, where more police block his path. He simply
       raises his arms, and they drag him away.

103    INT. POLICE CARRIAGE - MID-MORNING (LATER)                   103

       Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can
       see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his
       physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of
       him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't
       believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.


104    EXT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT                                    104

       PULL BACK FROM an image of a GOLDEN LION on a banner.
       We're at the Houses of Parliament.

      The carriage pulls up. Crowds are gathering outside,
      hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and enthusiasm.
      Holmes sees the hands of BIG BEN, climbing toward noon.


105   INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT                                    105

      The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and
      circumstance, at its ceremonial best.

      All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure
      of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and
      checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry-
      looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks.


106   INT. PARLIAMENT - LORD COWARD'S CHAMBERS                     106

      The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through
      putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by
      the sight of Holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked
      by Lestrade and men.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Lestrade?

                              LESTRADE
                Begging your pardon, m'lord, I
                know it's unorthodox, but Mr.
                Holmes has been making serious
                accusations about you and the
                order, sir.

      Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four
      orders pin.

                              HOLMES
                Oh, that solves the great mystery
                as to how you became inspector.

      Lestrade punches Holmes.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have five minutes before my next
                engagement, why don't you regale
                me with your stories of
                conspiracies. Thank you,
                Lestrade, if you could wait
                outside.

      Lestrade leaves and shuts the door.

                              HOLMES
                I'm curious, Coward, did you
                assist Blackwood in all the
                murders or just the one I
                prevented? Very distinctive those
                hand-made shoes of yours, but the
                price of quality is the unique
                imprint they leave.

      Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room.
      Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.

                               HOLMES
                Nonetheless, I confess to being
                completely out-matched. I could
                deduce very little from my
                investigation.

      Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a
      log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
      with smoke.

                              HOLMES
                Fortunately, there is nothing more
                stimulating than a case where
                everything goes against you. How
                many members of parliament do you
                intend to murder at noon today?
                     (beat)
                Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion
                is parliament, isn't it?

      Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment.

                              LORD COWARD
                Very clever. But it's not murder,
                Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are
                giving the weak masses a strong
                shepherd. Don't you see it's for
                their own good?

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.

                              HOLMES
                No, but I don't care much what you
                think. I simply wanted to know
                the location of Blackwood's final
                ceremony, and now you have given
                it to me.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have told you nothing.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found.
      Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.

                where you have been standing.

      Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a
      ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big
      ceremonial sword is prominent.

                              LORD COWARD (V.O.)
                It's a shame you made an enemy out
                of Blackwood, Holmes, you would
                have made a valuable ally. The
                powers at our disposal are far
                greater than you can imagine.

                              HOLMES (V.O.)
                You and Blackwood laid the final
                touches to your ceremony in the

                How terrible is wisdom, Holmes,
                when it brings no profit to the
                wise.
                      (turning to Holmes)
                We take power at noon.

      REVEAL Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward.

                Well there's no time to waste
                then, is there?

      Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
      Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
      another shot.

      With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
      Coward opened.

      Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
      the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --

      EXT. THAMES - OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT
      SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He
      disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the
      water. A moment of concern until we hear the familiar
      "chug" of a struggling engine.

      Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
      surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
      him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
      been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.

                              TANNER
                     (to Watson)
                I told you he'd be coming out the
                top window, soldier boy. No way
                he'd be coming over the terrace.

      Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
      Tanner takes it happily.

                              WATSON
                How was Lestrade?

                              HOLMES
                Performed his role perfectly.   A
                little too perfectly, come to
                think of it.

      Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.

                              WATSON
                Well, your instructions were
                fairly precise... about everything
                except the window.

      Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.

                              IRENE
                Where to, Sherlock?

      Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.

                              HOLMES
                Port side, Captain Tanner, into
                the sewers.

      Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.

                              HOLMES
                Watson, did you bring my clothes?

      Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
      Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
      it. He's never going to like guns.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

       Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is
       still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
       from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.

                                IRENE
                  Starting early, aren't we?

       He offers the flask to her.

                                HOLMES
                  Trust me, have a drink.

       She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
       takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
       Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
       it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
       his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.

                                WATSON
                  What are we doing in the sewers?

                                HOLMES
                  Patience, Doctor. I am about to
                  show you...

       As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward
       Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

107A                                                               107A

       Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the
       tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.

                                TANNER
                  Far as I can go.

       Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
       sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
       GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
       for him.)

       They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
       their way around corners and through junctions back under
       the Houses of Parliament.

      Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
      tunnel to:

      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:

      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
      a futuristic device:

                              HOLMES
                Behold, Blackwood's magic.

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:

                              HOLMES
                A chemical weapon. The first of
                its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.

                              WATSON
                You can tell that from here?

                               HOLMES
                No.   I can tell it from here.
      He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.

                              HOLMES
                I snipped this off a rather
                recumbent rat at the
                slaughterhouse. Note the blue
                discoloration, the faint smell of
                bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
                of cyanide.

      He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.

                              HOLMES
                That shaft leads directly to
                Parliament. When activated, those
                electrodes on either side will
                send a charge converting the
                cyanide powder into a gas.

                              IRENE
                All of the people inside that
                building --

                              WATSON

                 As if by magic. There will be no
                 one left to stop Blackwood and his
                 followers from assuming control.

       The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the shattered ceiling, UP a
       channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --


110A   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                        110A

       Air blows UP through the grate. The chamber is now full
       of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,
       Lord Coward steps up, checks the crowd. He sees a shadow
       up in the Lords' Gallery.

111                                                                  111

       Holmes checks his watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Seven minutes to twelve...

       They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
       tunnel, faster and faster.

       Irene trails them closely.

       Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
       It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.

       They draw their guns.
       They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
       thugs.

       Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the
       next.

       The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
       before he has a chance to fight or flee.

                                  HOLMES
                 I wouldn't.

       He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads
       straight for the device.

                               WATSON
                 I'll keep these under wraps.

                              HOLMES
                Take this.

      Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson
      herds the three thugs away from the device.

                              WATSON
                Over there.

      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --

      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.

      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).

                              IRENE
                I've never seen anything like it.

                              HOLMES
                There's never been anything like
                it. A totally wire-free weapon.
                He must have some kind of remote
                device sending a signal to the
                receiver. Really quite --

      She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
      hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
      humming, sparking coils.

      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --

      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.

      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
      sending both guns spinning away --

      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.

      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
      cup.

      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
      Irene.

      Holmes goes for Dredger.


113   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                       113

      Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
      session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
      emphatically.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Look.

      All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
      Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
      Blackwood is calm, commanding.

      Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
      doors as --

      BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.

114                                                               114
      INT. SEWERS - DAY
      The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
      for a moment.

      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
      the device.

      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
      defuse it.

      BONG!

      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
      enough to dislodge some.

      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
      even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
      as he loses air.

      BONG!

                 Nine strokes left.

      Dredger grins --

      -- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
      with full force by Watson.

      Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
      ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.

      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly
      enough, but not very big.

                               WATSON
                 You owe me for the ring.

      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
      uneven than usual.

      BONG!

      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --

      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
      cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.

                               HOLMES
                 Give me your gun. The bullets, I
                 need the bullets.

      BONG!   The clock is ticking down.

      Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
      Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
      knife, pouring the gunpowder into --

      -- the bowl of his pipe.

      BONG!

      Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
      sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.

      Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
      out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
      out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
      moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
      from head to toe.

      Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

       -- which shatters against the floor.

       While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer
       with a splash, then turns back to the device.

       BONG!

       Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
       the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
       familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are
       banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked.
       Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of
       anyone going to open them.

       Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
       the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place.
       Shaped charge, Victorian-style.

                               HOLMES
                 We need a light, a match --

       Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her
       KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.

                 Got it...
       Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
       both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
       device --

       -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
       he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
       pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.

       That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for
       long enough because --

       The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears
       ratchet past each other. Bad news.

                 Hey!

       Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his
       belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'
       GUN.

       BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
       strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
       back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
       through-and-through) --

       -- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away,
       eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.

       BONG!

                               IRENE

       Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.

       Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
       tree.

       Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls
       out of his limp hand.

       Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
       avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
       and...

       ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
       redirecting the spark toward --

       Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The
       shaped charge shears the steel rods.

       Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

       BONG!

                 You seem surprised. Did you                                
                 really take me for a man who could                         
                 be dispatched like a truculent                             
                 servant? I see before me a                                 
                 conspiracy of arrogant old men                             
                 puffed up by the illusion of their                         
                 own vainglory. In your hands this                          
                 once great parliament has become                           
                 nothing more than a drunken satyr,

       wall to complete the pentagram within the circle.

       ZZZZP! The electrical charge zaps through the device,

       Holmes and Irene RIP the cylinder out of the way just
       as... the sparks collide in a blinding flash and...

       The men wait for something mythic, magical.    And...

       Nothing happens. Nothing at all. They look around.
       Everyone is still standing. Coward looks confused,
       scared. Other Temple members eye him.

       Blackwood hits the remote again. But again, nothing
       happens. WE SEE something new in his eyes: fear. He
       ducks away fast, disappearing into the gallery.

       Holmes and Irene look each other in the eye.   For the
       first time, neither knows what to say.

                                IRENE
                  That was something new for us.

                                   HOLMES
                  Yes... it was.

       She looks past Holmes.

       Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He
       goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for
       a pulse.

       With his face still pressed to the stones:

                               WATSON
                 I'm pretty sure I heard the last
                 chime.

       Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.

                               HOLMES
                 Yes, we made it. Just.

       Watson rolls over, sits up.     He's done, had enough.

                               HOLMES
                 Come on, you've got to admit,
                 you're going to miss this.

                               WATSON
                 Which part? The stench of the
                 sewers or the broken bones?
                      (beat)
                 My ankle's done.

       Watson looks around.

                 Where's Irene?

       Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is
       Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.

                               WATSON
                 Holmes, I'm sorry...

       Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
       of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.

                               HOLMES
                 Make sure Lestrade keeps it
                 intact.

       Watson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness,
       face grim.

       Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns,
       sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels
       and columns. She picks up speed.
                                                          CUT TO:

       ANGLE FROM THE SIDE

       Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
       Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.

       Then Holmes.

       Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
       ahead -- pauses.

       It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
       action with Dredger.

       Blackwood scoops it up.

118C                                                              118C
       INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
       the pipe, into the unknown.


118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D

       The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
       it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
       breath the only point of reference.

       This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
       claustrophobic as it gets.

       Then, almost imperceptibly, light.

       We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
       increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

                                                          107.


118E   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118E

       The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
       the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.

       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.


118F   INT. PIPE - DAY                                             118F

       Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us.
       An even tighter fit for him.


118G   INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G

       Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --
       reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to
       shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
       is a grind.

118H                                                               118H
       INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY
       Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full
       of construction equipment, and sees, yes --

       -- more stairs, upward.   The only ready way out.

       Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
       stairs --


118I   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118I
       -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the
       fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.

       IN A SERIES OF TIME JUMPS MARKED BY INCREASING
       EXHAUSTION:

       Irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is
       flooded with sky-bright daylight.

       She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and --

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

118K   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE -         118K
       DAY

       OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up
       the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
       Thames.

       We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
       maximum knee-buckling exposure.

       PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
       HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the
       (unfinished) window --

       -- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
       scaffolding --

       -- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
       laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

       -- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she
       darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
       Thames.

       Irene works her way through the construction debris on
       the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.

       He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm.                    

       And in that split second --                                        

       Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with              
       WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,            
       Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks           
       her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the              
       bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:                                   

       She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out            
       Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and                
       KICKS DOWN and --                                                  

       IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.                                        

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 You're better off without her,

       High above:   a RAVEN lands.

       EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY
                                                                          
       A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
       short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
       Flimsy, no match for the sword --

       -- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
       slashes, chops six inches off the batten.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 I planned to kill a handful of                           
                 senile old men to make this empire                       
                 strong... but now because of you                         
                 thousands are going to die.                              

       Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
       his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
       defense third.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 All I have to do is break this                           
                 cylinder. The wind will do the                           
                 rest. And you'll be the first.                           

       The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some           
       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword             
       out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade              
       and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.             

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They                
       continue to spar, now bound.                                       

       Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes           
       simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with            
       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood            
       knocked from Irene's hand earlier).                                

       Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The               
       bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his            
       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a                 
       circle around him.                                                 

       Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
       go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to             
       Blackwood.                                                         

       -- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --

       -- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
       Blackwood around his ankle.

       Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
       the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.

       Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.                   

       Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
       painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
       remains cool.

       Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
       plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
       strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
       we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.

       Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
       second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
       whips harder.

       Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
       a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
       hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
       topple.

       (NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
       faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
       that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)

       to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
       rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
       strikes another crane...

                 Cut me loose, Holmes!

       Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
       looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
       dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.

                               HOLMES
                 You better hope that it's nothing

       Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
                                                                         
       Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
       releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
       breakneck speed.

       Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
       the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.

       Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
       The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
       Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

                                HOLMES
                  First, the world will see you for                        
                  what you are. Then you will                              
                  hang... properly this time.                              

       Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL              
       GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
       through the floorboards --

       Blackwood smirks.                                                   

                                BLACKWOOD                                  
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           
                  It's a long journey from here to                         
                  the rope.                                                

       CREAK.   Holmes looks up.    Blackwood looks up.                    

                                HOLMES                                     
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           

       BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden                 
       infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.                     

       Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
       CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to              
       snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
       and finally --

       SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
       Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.

       Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
       common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.

       Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
       the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
       sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
       cloud.

       His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things              
       that cannot be explained.
                                                                           
       Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:

       IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She                  
       appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is            
       coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He               
       takes her hand.                                                     

                                   HOLMES                                  
                  Oh, Irene...                                             

       His fingers move to take her pulse.

       Her eyes pop open.                                                 

       Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.   But             
       this time, Holmes is ready for it:                                 

       He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a            
       seat next to her.                                                  

       They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking           
       out over the Thames.                                               

                               IRENE                                      
                 It looks like rain.                                      

                               HOLMES                                     
                 We've still got a moment.                                

       A bit of a smile and break.                                        

                               IRENE                                      
                 You were right, he is a professor.                       
                 Moriarty. Key's in the watch                             
                 pocket.

       Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,               
       near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her                
       shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
       snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and                  
       walks away. She smiles, calls out:

                                IRENE
                  You'll miss me, Sherlock.

                  Sadly, yes.                                                

       Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword                   
       stick, keeps walking.

       At the end of the top of the stairs.    Holmes hands the              
       Cylinder to one of the policemen.

       Rain falls softly.

                                LESTRADE
                  It'll be a hell of a trick if
                  Blackwood comes back from this
                  one.

                                HOLMES
                  Thank you, Lestrade.

                                LESTRADE
                  Now you're going to be even more
                  arrogant and insufferable than
                  ever.

       Then Lestrade cracks a smile.

                                LESTRADE
                  You're welcome, detective.
                       (beat)
                  Is the woman up there?

                                HOLMES
                  She won't be by the time your boys
                  get there.

       Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls
       around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees...

       A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of
       WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson,
       no words spoken.

       Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it.
       The two of them stand looking out down the Thames.

       MOVING DAY. Mary and Watson walk towards 221B. A DRIVER
       loads Watson's boxes into a CARRIAGE that waits in front
       of the apartment.

                                 WATSON
                 One moment.

       Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes.

                               WATSON
                 Please make sure this one is put
                 on the desk in the front room.

                               MARY
                 What's in all those notebooks?

                               WATSON
                 Nothing really... Just a few
                 scribbles... cases we've worked on
                 over the years.

                               MARY
                 All your adventures... I'd love to
                 read them sometime.

       Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this
       idea before they enter.

       As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear                  
       that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger.
       Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.
                               WATSON
                 I still can't believe he's given
                 us that ring.

                               MARY
                 Do you think he's finally come to
                 terms with you leaving?

                                 WATSON
                 Of course.    No question about it --

       Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a
       horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back

                 he's far too fond of himself.

                 Good afternoon. I was trying to                        
                 deduce the manner in which                             
                 Blackwood survived his execution.

                 were. But it had a surprisingly                        
                 soporific effect and I was carried                     
                 off in the arms of Morpheus, like

      We FOLLOW POLICEMEN heading into the sewer tunnel.

      They spread out to seal the crime scene, where Holmes had
      dismantled Blackwood's device.

                We believe Sergeant Smith was the
                first officer there.

      SERGEANT SMITH sees a POLICEMAN leaning over the device.

                              SERGEANT
                Oi, what you doing?

      The policeman looks up, and a GUN slides into his hand by
      means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
      with Irene. We don't see his face.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)

                                                            CUT TO:


      FLASHBACK - THE POLICEMAN
      removes a small receiver-like object from Blackwood's
      device.


      BACK TO PRESENT

      Constable Clark nods.   Holmes pulls his coat on.

                 Moriarty was after the machine not
                 the poison.

      Holmes nods.

                               HOLMES
                 Blackwood's wire-free invention
                 was the game all along. It is
                 undoubtedly the more dangerous and
                 the more valuable of the two...
                      (wistful)
                 Irene was just a diversion.

      Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his
      enthusiasm and interest.

      A KNOCK.   The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in.

                               MAN
                      (to Watson)
                 I've loaded the last of your
                 boxes, sir.

      Watson nods, the Driver exits.    Watson turns to Holmes.

                               WATSON
                 Well...

                               HOLMES
                 I'll walk out with you...

                                                       118.


127   EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - DAY                                      127

      Mary and Gladstone wait for Watson in the carriage.

      Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat.
      Holmes extends an awkward hand.

                              HOLMES
                An honor working with you, Doctor.

      Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.      A
      warm look, an understanding between the two men.

                              WATSON
                Take care of yourself, Holmes.

      Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary
      stops him.

                              MARY
                Try not to be too late for dinner
                with my parents and... be careful.

      She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.   Watson
      looks relieved and excited.

                              HOLMES
                Magnificent woman, Watson.
                Magnificent!

      They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
      pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
      WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
      the POV of the raven.

                                                        FADE OUT.




                                 THE END
