          FADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES)

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY

          The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the
          middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;
          shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the
          screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

                         "1:52"
          Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
          face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
          bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
          rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
          wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
          package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
           it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
          "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
          quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
          he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
          CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:

          "SUBWAY."

          INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY

          A level above the locals, two above the express trains.
          Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.
          Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives
          his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes
          through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
          stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:

          "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY

          Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a
          placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
          the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the
          point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the
          sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green
          turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the
          track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
          far end of the platform.

          SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV
          as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white
          sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
          roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with
          the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair
          of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now
          MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the
          still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing
          on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

          MED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR
           From the platform, featuring the conductor (BUD CARMODY)
          as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He
          has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red
          hair.

          INT. FIFTH CAR

          The door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to
          lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an
          older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing
          the younger man.

                         MATSON
          C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can
          hear what you're doin'.

                         BUD
          I'm checking the passengers getting
          on and off -- front and back --
          okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut-
          ting the doors; -.rear section

                         FIRST --
          (pushes a button)
          -- then the front section --

                         (PUSHES ANOTHER)
          -- and -- the doors are closed.
          He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel.

                         BUD
          Now I 'm checking the indicator box
          to make sure that the doors are
          all locked -- okay.
          The train starts with a jerk.

                         BUD
          Igo back out the window --

                         (HE DOES)
          -- for a distance of three car-
          lengths to see that nobody's
          being dragged --

                         (RETURNING)
          -- I remove my door key -- and
          then the skate key -- and then
          I hit the transmitter button.
          (into a mike)
          Fifty-first Street' next stop --
          the next stop is Fifty-first Street.
          (turning to Matson)
          How'd I do?

                         MATSON
          How come you wanna be a conductor,
          anyway? Don't you know the con-
          ductor's sittin' in the goddam
          hotseat?

                         BUD
          What do you mean, Mr. Matson?

                         MATSON
          You're visible, for God's sake!
          Anything goes wrong -- anyone's
          got a gripe -- you're the one they
          see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years
          o' stickin' my head out there I
          been slugged, spit on, hit by
          purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers,
          baseball mitts -- an'.I been god-
          dam lucky! I never been puked on
          by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was
          on the Parkchester line -- or
          stabbed in the neck like I heard
          one fella was on the Astoria BMT --

                         BUD

                         (QUIETLY)
          Jesus.

                         MATSON
          You take my advice, kid -- serve
          your six months an' then put in
          for Motorman. Watch it, we're
          cumin' in.
          Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and
          hits his transmitter button.

                         BUD

                         BUD

                         (CORRECTING)
          Fifty-first Street, sorry
          the station is Fifty-first Street.

                         MATSON
          Never say you're sorry, kid --
          somebody'll come back here an'
          bust your goddam nose.

                          CONTINUED - 2
           Bud sticks his head out the window, remembers what Matson
           told him and pulls it partially back in.

           51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV
           SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train
           enters the station. We flash by the "rear-enders" (those
          I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we
          stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man
          (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different
          from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals
          -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,
          slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-
          tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away.

          PLATFORM - GREY
          RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down-
          track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark
          brown.

          INT. FOURTH CAR

          Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding
          them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts
          with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes
          up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and
          placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He
          surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.

          INT. FIRST CAR

          Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the
          motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between
          his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten
          and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm
          door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before
          them, playing.: at driving the train.

          INT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB

          Bud is removing his key and activating his mike.

                         BUD

                         MATSON
          Yeah -- if I was you I'd start
          studyin' for that motorman's exam
          right now.

                         BUD
          To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson,
          I have been. Want to hear some-
          thing?

                         (RECITING)
          Every car on the IRT is seventy-two
           feet long, cost $250,000 and weighs
          75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats
          with room for 136 standing.

                         MATSON
          'Cept at rush hour when you can
          push in another 20, at least.
          Honest to God, I. know personally
          of a case where this guy on a number
          5 train dies of a heart attack at
          Union Square and he has t' wait
          until the Grand Concourse in the
          Bronx before enough people get off
          so's he can fall down.

                         (A PAUSE)
          Honest to God.

                         BUD
          Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me
          last week said that happened on a
          double -A train on the West Side.

                         MATSON
          Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A
          wop or an American?

                         (LOOKING OUT)
          Here's where I'm gettin' off --
          think you can get to Brooklyn
          Bridge all by yourself?

                         BUD

                         (GRINNING)
          Long as I don't have 'to drive --

                         MATSON
          Stick with it, kid -- you're doin'
          great. See ya t'morrow.
          He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates.
          Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson
          as he does.

                         BUD
          Grand Central Station -- change
          for the express. This is Grand
          Central.

                         IN
          The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out,
          colliding with a very large man (BROW^?PN) who is in a hurry
          to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white,
          bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch
          hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries
          an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen-
          long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.

                         MATSON
          What's your hurry, chief? We
          won't leave without you.
          Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does
          not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off
          into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the
          front of the car.

          INT. FIRST CAR - GREEN

          Still sitting, still facing the motorman's cab. The two
          boys continue to play at the front window. The doors can
          be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion.

          Suddenly Green's hand,clutches at his shirt collar, unbut-
          toning the top button and loosening his tie. He breathes
          a sigh of relief, ' then notices that his left leg is vibrat-
          ing. He quickly stills it by placing a hand on his knee.

          INT. FOURTH CAR - GREY

          Leaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his
          valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the
          platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches
          sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively.
          Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and
          starts forward through the car, heading for the third car.
          At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door,
          leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and
          waits a moment. Finally:

                         GREY
          Your ass.
          The man looks around and surveys Grey.

          The man glances at Grey for a moment, then moves it.
          Grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform
          between the two cars.

          number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in
          one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling
          sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on
          the northbound express track, its lights flashing between
          the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies.
          Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant

          He hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the
          train, then, without haste, carrying the valpac in one
          hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the
          front of the first car. The Motorman (DENNY DOYLE), a
          middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped
          overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back
          along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his
          right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the
          train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of
          the rest of the train.

                         DOYLE
          Hey -- how do you expect me to -- ?
          He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very
          large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has
          placed the muzzle against his (Doyle's) head. Doyle
          jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against
          the windowframe. Blue crooks his hand inside the window
          and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek,
          directly under his right eye.

          A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and
          a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS,
          a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing
          phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and
          other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however,
          i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one
          wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements
          of every train that passes through the sector, all of it
          superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track
          routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes
          over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter.

                         MARINO
          Jesus Christ, Cazâ€¢, you picked a
          helluva day to be late --

                         CAZ
          You wanted a plumber down here,
          didn't you? Whose goddam wedding
          ring was it?

                         MARINO

                         (POINTING)
          Who else? Mrs. Jenkins.

          MRS. JENKINS
          I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz -- it just
          slipped off.

                         CAZ
          What were you doin'r with your hand
          in the john, anyway?

          MRS. JENKINS
          (indignant).
          My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr.
          Dolowicz -- it was over the john.

                         CAZ
          What's the difference?
          (to the Plumber)
          Go fish it out, will ya?
          As the Plumber heads off, Caz turns to Marino.

                         CAZ
          The classification's been open to
          women for only a month and already
          we're in the goddam toilet!
          (glancing at the

                         BOARD)
          What the hell's that?

                         MARINO
          That's what I've been tryin' -to
          tell you, Caz -- a southbound local.
          He's laying down between 28th and
          23rd.

                         CAZ
          What the hell for?

                         MARINO
          Dunno yet.

                         CAZ
          How long?

                         MARINO
          Couple-three minutes. Command
          Center's been trying to raise him
          but so far he don't answer the
          radio. Jesus, Caz -- why don't
          he answer the radio?

                         CAZ
          Take it easy, Marino -- there's
          lots o' reasons. Maybe he jumped
          a ball and hadda leave the cab to
          reset a tripper -- or a door got
          hung and he hadda go fix it. Any-
          thing more serious and he'd'a
          called in for a car knocker.

                         MARINO
          It's been too long, Caz --

                         CAZ
          Then maybe his radio's busted and
          the sonuvabitch is too lazy to climb
          down and use a telephone! I'm gonna
          write him up for.this, goddammit --
          I'm gonna have his assn

                         TOWERMAN
          Hey -- it's moving!
          Everyone wheels around to stare up at the Board.

                         CAZ
          For Jesus Christ sake! The dumb
          bastard's moving backwards!!

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL

          Slowly, the second to the tenth cars are moving away from
          the first car which continues to lie motionless on the track.
          The rear cars roll about a hundred feet.

          INT. SECOND CAR - CAB

          as Green, leaning out the window and looking behind him, now
          applies the brake handle and the train grinds to a halt.

          INT. TOWER ROOM

          Caz, Marino and the others are staring up at the Model Board.

                         MARINO
          He's stopped again!

          CAZ.
          Stopped is better than backwards.

          INT. SECOND CAR - CAB

          as Green removes the brake handle and the two keys, stuffs
          them back into his pockets and leaves the cab.

          INT. SECOND CAR

          Brown and Bud are waiting as Green steps out. Bud stares
          at him.

                         GREEN
          What's wrong with you?

                         BUD

          He opens the storm door and holds it as Green goes through
          first.

          INT. TUNP'EL

          as Green comes out onto the threshold plate, crouches low
          to ease the impact, then jumps down onto the concrete
          roadbed. Bud is next and Green helps him down. Then
          Brown. They walk quickly through'the tunnel to the first
          car. Grey has opened the storm door for them and steps
          out onto the plate to help them up.

          Blue and Doyle, the latter watching wide-eyed as the former
          opens his trombone case and removes a submachine gun. He
          checks it then sets it aside and removes the cord from
          Green's package.

                         RADIO (CORRELL)
          Come in, Pelham One Two Three
          for Chrissake come in -- I
          Blue opens the package, removing a second, identical
          automatic weapon. As he checks it out, a rapping sounds
          at the metal door and Blue opens it. Green squeezes in.

                         BLUE
          Any trouble, Mr.'Green?

                         GREEN
          Smooth as silk, Mr. Blue.

                         BLUE
          I unpacked your weapon. Get
          this thing moving -- we're run-
          ning almost two minutes behind.
          Picking up his submachine gun, and holding it vertically
          along his pants leg, Blue eases himself through the door
          and shuts it after him.

          RADIO (CO RRELL )

          Green quickly replaces the brake handle and eases the
          controller to the left.

          INT. FIRST CAR

          it is moving slowly. Blue stands by the cab, his gun still
          held hidden behind his leg. He looks down the length of
          the car.

          MED. SHOT - BROWN ,
          He undoes his flower box and removes another submachine gun.

          MED. SHOT - GREY
          He has opened his valise and has taken out still another
          submachine gun which he grins at, happily.

          He comes forward to the center of the car, now, making no

          Is that understood?
          This news is met in stony, awe-struck, terrified silence.
          Except for the Pimp who smiles, seemingly relaxed.

          A uniformed TRANSIT COP sits behind the desk, watching him.
          Finally: an elevator door opens and a smart, efficient
          SECRETARY emerges, followed by FOUR JAPANESE in business
          suits.

                         SECRETARY
          Ah, Lieut. Prescott -- it was nice
          of you to leave your duties long

          I sure will.
          She smiles at the Japanese and walks back to the elevators,
          pressing the UP button. Prescott looks at the four men
          for a moment, uncertainly, then goes after the Secretary
          and speaks to her in low tones.

          The door closes. Prescott shrugs, then turns and smiles
          at the visitors. They smile back. He takes a deep
          breath, then begins.

                         PRESCOTT
          The New York City Subway System
          is the largest'in the world, with
          237 miles of track and seven
          thousand cars that carry over a
          billion and a third passengers
          every year, making it also the
          busiest railroad in,the world.
          I can see that this last fact
          surprises you.
          The Japanese look anything but surprised. Prescott goes
          on, resolutely.

          the busiest station passenger-wise
          -- train-wise, it's West 4th St.
          on the I.N.D. line. Now, if you'll
          step this way, gentlemen -
          They step no way at all. Prescott gestures broadly.

                         PRES COTT
          This way --
          He hurries ahead of them to open the door and hold it for
          them as they finally follow.

                         PRES COTT
          We are entering the headquarters

          the various areas of the system. Colored lights -- red an&
          yellow -- are continually changing and flickering.

                         PRESCOTT'S VOICE
          The Status Board pinpoints the
          disposition of every Transit
          Authority policeman presently in
          the field. Things are usually
          jumping pretty good in here.
          CAMERA begins to ZOOM BACK, revealing the scene: a large
          room, cut. up by glass dividers into a maze of squares and
          rectangles manned by uniformed T.A. POLICEMEN, sitting at
          desks with telephone consoles. The place is absolutely
          dead -- some reading, some eating, some sleeping.

                         PRESCOTT'S VOICE
          We have one of our own T.A. cops
          on every station and every train
          in the entire system between the
          hours of eight P.M. and four A.M.
          Since we instituted this watch,

          of crime on the Tokyo subway, right?
          They merely stare at Prescott and smile.

          Right.
          He.clears his throat, loosens his tie and looks around for
          help.

          Prescott has stopped beside a desk. GARBER, 40, stocky,
          dour, with a dark stubble that requires shaving twice a
          day, is absorbed reading the Village Voice.

          Yeah, well -- we had a bomb scare
          in the Bronx yesterday -- but it

          charges away.

                         PRESCOTT
          In the course of a normal week the

          crimes as robbery, assault, murder,
          drunkenness, injury, illness,

          To illustrate, he waves a bottom corner of his jacket at
          the Japanese who nod appreciatively. Then he lifts a
          pistol from his shoulder holster, just far enough to show
          the handle.

          A train is standing with its doors open, and lit within
          only by the emergency bulbs. Caz hurries south along the
          platform, heading for the first car, his ample stomach
          bouncing over his low-slung belt, CAMERA LEADING him until

          the roadbed and starts through the darkened tunnel. He
          breaks into a trot, only to slow to a walk and then stop
          as he sees something approaching in the darkness: a

          a tractor-trailer is stretched across the street, lining
          up its rear-end with the narrow opening of a loading
          bay, in preparation for backing into it. Now the truck
          starts backing, and while there is still some space open
          (on the sidewalk) it is closing fast. The cycles screech
          to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to
          as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the
          opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes
          of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the

          and, perhaps, the scene flopping over as the truck,

          I've got it. Is that all?
          For now. But keep it in mind
          that the same ground rules apply
          -- any wrong move by anyone and
          we'll kill a hostage.

                         PRESCOTT
          I could've. guessed that part.
          You have ten minutes to deliver the
          money. If it isn't here by then --

                         PRESCOTT
          Yeah, I know -- -it's getting mono-
          tonous. I don't suppose you'll give
          us longer than ten minutes --
          Ten's more than enough, Prescott

          I'll call you with the final set
          of instructions.

          as two motorcycles, sirens blasting, push their way through
          the crowd and stop at the Borough Commander's command post.
          One driver alights and goes to help the other remove the
          canvas sack of money off the back of the second bike. They
          carry it together to the Borough Commander.

                         BOROUGH COMMANDER

          They take the sack from. the cyclists, hike it up onto
          O'Keefe's shoulder and hurry off, running down the steps
          into the subway.

          The Mayor, wrapped in a blanket, is smiling and nodding
          as he passes through the crowd, led by a wedge of COPS,
          flanked on one side by the Commissioner, and on the other
          by Warren LaSalle. The BoroughrCommander waits for him,
          shaking his head in disgust.

          to go down into the tunnel with a
          bullhorn and make a personal appeal
          to the hijackers.

          I'm afraid not.

          The Commander looks at the Commissioner who stares right
          back, blankly. Then he turns to the Mayor.

          I appreciate your wanting to
          help, sir, but you've come at
          a very bad time.

          MISKOWSKY'S POV (TRAVELLING)
          A FIGURE in the shadows, standing behind a pillar, seen
          only in silhouette as CAMERA PASSES him -- his helmet, his
          high-powered rifle, etc. -- looking very menacing.

          MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE (TRAVELLING)

                          MIS KOWSKY
          You realize we got four submachine
          guns ahead of us and all those

          The lone car, lit from within -- and the silhouette of Brown
          at the rear storm door.

          MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES
          Standing behind his pillar. Now he turns his peaked cap
          around and, turning his face to the pillar, slowly moves
          his head to one side.

          SHOOTING from behind the pillar. As the CAMERA slowly
          CRABS, the subway car comes into view -- and we see Brown
          standing at the rear door, much more clearly than before..

          MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES
          as he. peeks around the pillar. Now, slowly, he brings his
          right hand up and, pointing his index finger.like a gun,
          "fires."

          with himself.

          Shiiiiiit.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          From the other side of the pillar as James ducks back behind
          it, turns his back to it and looks around for another way
          of amusing himself. He notices his real gun in a holster
          at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he
          assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it,
          knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his
          holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a
          reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure
          in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in
          amazement -- there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time,
          Brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his
          submachine gun, the bullets ricocheting off the metal
          pillars.

          MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE
          as they drop onto the roadbed, bullets whining all around
          them.

          For Chrissake, they're shooting
          at us!,
          O'Keefe pushes the sack of money in front of them and they
          press flat behind it.

          and there is glass all over the floor nearby. Brown is
          just in the process of sitting heavily in the single
          isolated seat near the door, a dark red patch blossoming
          on his sleeve, just below the right shoulder, his sub-
          machine gun resting in his lap. He begins examining his
          wound with his left hand. Grey s--ands at the rear door,
          pressed flat against the wall, peering out.

          Blue spots something, bends and picks up a lump of metal
          which he tosses to Brown who watches it in his bloodied left
          hand, glances at it, then throws it away.

                         BLUE
          How does it feel?

          BROWN.
          Okay -- I never feel pain too much.

          How many shots were there?

                         BROWN
          Just one -- the rest was me. I
          didn't see anything -- I guess I
          just got mad -- no sense to it --

          I'm not mad any more -- forget it.

          at Brown while Blue slides open the door.

          appear -- only their faces peering into the car. O'Keefe
          tosses the sack off his shoulder onto the car's floor and it
          lands with a thud. Miskowsky and O'I :eefe look up at Blue
          and Brown who merely stare back. No one speaks. Then the

          blood-stained kerchief tied around his right upper arm.
          Both wear what can only be called money vests: canvas,

          Power restored and the track cleared

          back on the pipe and the two longer sections, angled
          together, disengage and come loose in his hand. He starts
          to lose his balance but Brawn grabs him and pulls him back

          INT. FIRST CAR

          Some of the Passengers have gone to the front of the car.
          The W.A.S.P. is trying to open the door to the Motorman's
          cab, but there's no outside handle so all he can do is pound
          impotently against it. The Mother remains in her seat
          holding her two boys pressed against her. Now the Old Man
          starts pushing his way up front.

                         OLD MAN
          My friends -- please -- the situa-
          tion isn't as lousy as it looks --

                         FAG
          Just a little lousy's good enough
          for me.

          W.A.S.P.
          I never knew these things went
          so fast.

                         MOTHER
          We're going to be killedl

                         OLD MAN
          No -- no we won't! I admit that
          right now we're on a run-away train,
          but it's only temporary --
          The car careens into a curve and sways wildly as the metal
          wheels scrape and screech. There's a good deal of scream-
          ing and shouting from the Passengers as several fall down.
          The Old Man starts to topple but the Pimp steadies him.

                         OLD ILXN
          Thank you, brother.

          THE TUNNEL (UNDERCRANKED)
          SHOOTING straight ahead from the-front of the train.
          Nothing but green lights ahead as the train races along.

          INT. TUNNEL - HIPPIE

          Propped up now against a pillar, straining to look at
          something, off.

          HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV
          Blue and Brown are tying the second money vest on Green,
          then help him on with his shirt 4nd coat.

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          He returns his attention to the business of locating his
          gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme
          discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and
          does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise
          of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,
          lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in
          both hands and starts to take aim.

          HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV
          with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as
          the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency
          exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,
          and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through
          the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers
          on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses
          and topples backwards.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Blue stands behind a pillar, his gun in hand, peering into
          the darkness, trying to locate the marksman. Green is in
          the well of the emergency exit, beside the metal ladder
          that leads up through a grate and out onto the street.
          Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's
          body lies face up on the ground. Green now gestures for
          Blue to come across the open area separating then.

                         GREEN

          -- I've got to. get him. Go on

                         UP -- 1
          Green hesitates, looks up the ladder, looks back at Blue.

                         GREEN
          I -- I'll wait for you -- 1
          Blue looks at him fora moment, then checks his pistol and,
          slowly, steps out from behind the pillar. A shot rings out
          immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly.
          Blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash.

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending
          the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest,
          below the right shoulder. He topples over, sprawling
          across one rail, onto the roadbed.

          ICED, SHOT - BLUE
          He has stepped back behind his pillar again to listen.
          Silence.

          He listens again, then leaves his pillar, and hurries
          downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens,

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          Inadvertently, he groans.

          MED. SHOT - BLUE
          He has heard. Now he steps out from behind the pillar and
          starts forward to the next, a-little more secure.

          as he continues walking, unhurried, toward the Hippie.
          Finally he arrives, stops, looks down at the injured man.

          You were on the train. Are you
          a cop?

          by. The Mayor is wrapped. in a heavy overcoat, a woolen
          muffler and a fur hat with ear-muffs.

                         MAYOR
          Congratulations, Patrolman --

                         UH --

                         COMMISSIONER
          Berry -- Robert G.

                         MAYOR
          -- Patrolman Berry -- all right if
          I call you Bob? You performed an
          act of extraordinary valor, Bob --
          the people of the city of New York
          are in your debt.

                         (HE SNEEZES)

                         WARREN
          Shake his hand, Nate --
          The Mayor reaches out to shake hands, but the Hippie is too
          weak to lift his -- so the Mayor picks it up from atop the
          covers and pumps it. A flashbulb pops from the Photo-
          grapher's camera. Then the Mayor sneezes again.

                         COMMISSIONER
          Splendid work, Berry -- the De-
          partment's very proud of you.
          I've already put you in for pro-
          motion.

                         HIPPIE

                         (WEAKLY)
          Thank you, sir -- I only did what
          any other man on the force would've --

                         MAYOR
          So long now, Bob -- hurry up and
          get well, will you, fella? And
          congratulations again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          151.

                         CONTINUED

                         HIPPIE
          Thank you, sir -- I only did what
          any other man on the force
          But they're already moving toward the door.

                         MAYOR
          He looks better than I do --
          probably feels better, too.
          The Hippie's eyes slowly close as he goes back to sleep.
          The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

          "9:03."

          EXT. TRANSIT AUTHORITY BLDG. - J AY ST. - NIGHT

          as Prescott comes down the front steps, alone, wearing a
          raincoat against the night's chill. He starts off down the
          street.

          EXT. FULTON ST. - NIGHT

          Most of the stores closed, their iron grills drawn, as Pres-
          cott walks along. He stops at a corner newsstand that's just
          being boarded up by an OLD WOMAN. He spots the Daily News
          headline -- "I.R.T. TRAIN HIJACKED!" -- and buys one.

                         OLD WOMAN
          Know what's gonna go next? The
          Empire State Building.

                         PRESCOTT

                         (SMILING)
          I wouldn't be surprised.
          He starts off down the street again, having folded back the
          front page and. now reading the third page. Suddenly he
          crumples the paper into a ,ball between his two hands, fakes
          dribbling it along the sidewalk, makes a good move, fakes
          one man, spins away from another and, hooking a high arching
          shot at a wire mesh trash basket, watches it hit the rim and
          bounce away, onto the pavement.

          PRES CO"'T

                         (SOFTLY)
          Shit.
          He keeps on walking as the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

          "10:14."

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
