                         THE STING

     FADE IN:

     A white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner
     of the screen:

     AUGUST, 1936

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY

     It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the
     streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters),
     and the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary
     figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering
     what appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a
     second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back
     of his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the
     aura of one who is making money for the first time and
     broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in
     this part of town.

     We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second
     floor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious
     doorman.

     INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

     Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring
     people.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place
     immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on
     a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600
     to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The
     bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,
     where they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
     Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous
     earnings or to ask for credit.

     Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
     slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful
     and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man
     named Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
     the radio in the background.

     Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little
     interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a
     little pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away,
     obviously having been through this before.

                         PHONE GIRL
               Beat it, Mottola.

     Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,
     who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.  The
     phone rings.

                         PHONE GIRL
               8720...Yes, hold on a second.
                    (calling over to the Supervisor)
               Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.


     Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago,
     but takes the phone anyway.

                         GRANGER
               Yeh?

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY

     A flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the
     line.  Visible beyond the door and interior window of his
     office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters,
     clerks and adding machines.  This room is the clearinghouse
     for all the transaction of the numbers game.  All the
     betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here
     and processed.

                         COMBS
               Granger, this is Combs.  Why
               haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody
               else is in.

                         GRANGER
               We had a few problems with the Law
               this morning.  The Mayor promised
               the Jaycees to get tough on the
               rackets again, so he shut everybody
               down for a couple hours to make it
               look good.  Nothing serious, it
               just put us a little behind for the
               day.

                         COMBS
               You been making your payoffs,
               haven't ya?

                         GRANGER
               Hell yes.  He does this every year.
               There's nothing to worry about.

                         COMBS
               Okay, finish your count and get it
               up here as soon as you can.  I
               don't wanta be here all night.

                         GRANGER
               Believe me, the Man's gonna be real
               happy.  Looks like we cleared over
               ten grand this week.

                         COMBS
                    (not impressed)
               We cleared 22 here.

                         GRANGER
               Well, hell, you got the whole
               Chicago south side.  How do ya
               expect the eight lousy spots I've
               got to compete with that?

                         COMBS
                    (reading off a sheet
                    of paper on his desk)
               They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5
               is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks
               like you're bringing up the rear,
               Granger.

     INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

     Granger burns inside.  One of the girls who's been sorting
     and counting hands him a slip of paper.

                         GRANGER
               I just got the count.  We'll put
               the take on the 4:15.

                         COMBS
               We'll be waitin'.

     Combs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave
     the needle to Granger.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

     Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door.

                         GRANGER
                    (snapping)
               Mottola.

     Mottola hustles out of his chair.

                         GRANGER
                    (handing him a bundle
                    of bills)
               Take this up to the city on the
               4:15.  They'll be waitin' for it at
               the clearing house.  And don't stop
               for no drinks.  You can get a cab
               down the street.

     Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
     pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.  No
     one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
     messenger boy.

     EXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN

     Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.
     He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large
     alleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is
     deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young
     stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The
     man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.

     Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
     behind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered
     looking thief come racing around the corner and down the
     alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black
     man.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries
     for help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at
     Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies
     himself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands
     there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.
     Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws
     his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling
     and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his
     left hand.

     The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
     to where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola
     picks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
     back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both
     the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
     The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight,
     begins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor
     particularly strong.

                         THIEF
                    (shaking his fist at
                    the stranger)
               You fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get
               you for this someday, sucker egg.

     Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
     thief flees out onto the street and disappears.

     The black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is
     staggering toward them.  He collapses against the alley wall
     after a few steps.  The stranger rushes over to him, followed
     somewhat absently by Mottola.

                         BLACK MAN
               The wallet.  You gotta go after him.
               He's got all the money.

                         STRANGER
               Don't worry, we got the wallet.
               What happened?  He get ya with the
               knife?

     The stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody
     wound at the top of his leg.

                         BLACK MAN
                    (trying to move)
               Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta
               know it's all there!

                         STRANGER
               You just sit tight, old man.  We're
               gonna have to get you to a doctor.
                    (starting to leave)
               I'll call a cop.

                         BLACK MAN
               No, no cops!

     Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now
     opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber
     band.  Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of
     money.

                         STRANGER
                    (a little uneasy)
               You wanted by the law or somethin'?

                         BLACK MAN
               Naw, it's okay.

                         STRANGER
               You're crazy carryin' that kinda
               money in this neighborhood.  No
               wonder you got hit.

                         BLACK MAN
                    (trying to get to his feet)
               Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I
               gotta get goin'.
                    (his leg gives way
                    under him)

                         STRANGER
               You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

                         BLACK MAN
               I gotta!  Look, I run some slots
               down in West Bend for a mob here.
               I got a little behind on my payoffs
               so they figure I been holdin' out
               on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to
               come up with the cash.  I don't get
               it there I'm dead.

                         STRANGER
               It don't look good, gramps, it's
               ten of now.

                         BLACK MAN
               I got a hundred bucks for you and
               your friend if you deliver the
               money for me.

                         STRANGER
                    (hesitates)
               I dunno.  That little mug that got
               ya is mad enough at me already --
               what if he's out there waitin'
               around a corner with some friends.

                         BLACK MAN
               He won't know you're carryin' it.
               C'mon, you gotta help me out.

                         STRANGER
                    (makes up his mind)
               Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call
               you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk
               into a bunch of knives for ya.

                         BLACK MAN
                    (desperate to Mottola)
               How bout you?  I'll give you the
               whole hundred!

                         STRANGER
               What makes you think you can trust
               him?  He didn't do shit.

                         MOTTOLA
               Hey, butt out, chicken liver.  I
               gave him back his wallet, didn't I?
                    (to black man)
               How far is this place?

                         BLACK MAN
               1811 Mason.  Put it in Box 3C.  You
               won't have no trouble.  There's
               five thousand dollars there and
               here's a hundred for you.

                         MOTTOLA
                    (taking the bundle of
                    bills from the black
                    man, plus the $100 bill)
               All right.  I'll make your drop for
               you, old man.  And don't worry, you
               can trust me.

     Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next
     to the numbers money.  The stranger, who has now finished
     bandaging, watches him do it.

                         STRANGER
               If that punk and his pals decide to
               search ya, you'll never fool 'em
               carryin' it there.

                         BLACK MAN
                    (suddenly afraid again)
               What do we do?

                         STRANGER
               You got a bag or somethin?

                         BLACK MAN
               No.

                         STRANGER
               How 'bout a handkerchief?

                         BLACK MAN
               Here.

     The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a
     wrinkled handkerchief.

                         STRANGER
               Let me have the money.

     Mottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to
     the Stranger.  He puts it in the handkerchief.

                         STRANGER
               You better stick that other in here
               too, if you wanta keep it.
     


                         BLACK MAN
                    (pleading)
               Just hurry, will ya.

     Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the
     handkerchief too.  The stranger ties it all up.

                         STRANGER
                    (demonstrating by
                    slipping the bundle
                    down into crotch)
               All right.  Carry it down in your
               pants here.
                    (pulling it back out
                    and tucking it in
                    Mottola's pants)
               Ain't no hard guy in the world
               gonna frisk ya there.

                         MOTTOLA
               Thanks.
                    (to the black man)
               So long, partner.  Don't worry,
               everything's gonna be all right.

     The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of
     worry on his face.  Mottola trots off down the alley and out
     onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of
     trouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the
     cab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the
     knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
     Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking
     into a dead run.

     We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening
     a big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi
     zone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door.

     INT. TAXI - DAY

     He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.

                         CABBIE
               Where to?

                         MOTTOLA
               Which way is Mason?

                         CABBIE
               About 20 blocks south.

                         MOTTOLA
               Okay, go north.  The Joliet
               Station -- Fast.
     


Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.

                         CABBIE
               What's so funny?

                         MOTTOLA
               I just made the world's easiest
               five grand.

     He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to
     gaze upon his new-found fortune.  He unties the handkerchief.
     It's full of toilet paper.  Mottola looks like he's just
     been shot.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN

     hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con
     artists on the lam.  It's hard to run they're laughing so
     hard.  The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and
     pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants.

                         BLACK MAN
               Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know
               he was that loaded?

                         STRANGER
               Hell no, I just cut into him.  I
               woulda settled for pawning one of
               them shoes.

     As they split off, music begins, and we go into a

     TITLES SEQUENCE

     Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
     establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to
     friends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following:

     EXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY

     Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
     It's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime.

     INT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY

     A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.  We pick
     him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
     on the fire escape.  The rinse water drips down through the
     landing into the grimy alley below.

                         HOOKER
                    (singing)
               'With plenty of money and you-oo-
               oo,
               Oh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo-
               oo...'

     ON THE STREET AGAIN

     jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers,
     obviously on his way to see someone special.

     IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE

     Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne,
     watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named
     Crystal, do her routine.

     Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage.

                         CRYSTAL
                    (tired)
               Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or
               somethin'?

                         HOOKER
               Come into a little dough.  You
               wanna get outa here tonight?

                         CRYSTAL
               Can't.  I got a 10 o'clock show.  I
               need the five bucks.

                         HOOKER
               I'll spend fifty on ya.

     Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle.  We're
     pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight.

     COMING INTO A POOR MAN'S GAMBLING JOINT

     Little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place
     contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables.  Hooker,
     accompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman
     and proceeds to a table where there are already several
     other people laying their bets for the next spin.  Hooker
     knows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy.

                         JIMMY
                    (glad to see him)
               Hooker!

                         HOOKER
               How ya doin', Jimmy.
     


                         JIMMY
                    (collecting bets and
                    paying off the winners)
               Ain't seen you in months, boy.
               Thought maybe you took a fall.

                         HOOKER
               Naw, just a little hard times,
               that's all.  It's all over now.

                         JIMMY
               You gonna have a go here?
                    (pointing to the
                    betting board)
               How 'bout a ten spot on the line
               here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good
               today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street
               down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

     As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning
     and drops in the ball.  Betting is allowed to continue until
     the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.

                         HOOKER
                    (taking out his wallet)
               Three grand on the black.

     Jimmy is stunned.  The others at the table, used to dollar
     bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.

                         JIMMY
                    (worried)
               You sure you wanna start off that
               big?  Bet like that could put a
               real dent in us.

                         HOOKER
               I feel lucky tonight.

                         JIMMY
               Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you
               just...

                         HOOKER
               Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

     Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting
     ready to drop into the center.  We see Jimmy quickly press a
     hidden lever under the table with his foot.  The ball falls
     and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite
     right.  The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker
     is not fooled.  He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows
     that Hooker is on to him.

                         JIMMY
               Sorry, Hooker.
                    (making an attempt at
                    levity, in order to explain)
               Good thing that ball came up red.
               Guy could get in trouble around
               here, losin' a bet that big.

     Jimmy reaches for Hooker's money.  Hooker stops him by
     putting his hand on it.

                         HOOKER
               Spin it again.

     Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do.  He gives Hooker a
     little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one
     of the walls.  Behind it, we see a pair of eyes.  Suddenly,
     Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it
     doesn't change his demand.

                         HOOKER
               Spin it anyway, Jimmy.

     Jimmy is beside himself.  If he doesn't spin again, Hooker
     may expose him.  If he does spin, and loses, his management
     will fire him.  He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's
     no use.  Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the
     ball.  This time there is no foot on the lever, and it
     settles into black 15.  Hooker stares at the ball a second
     and then looks up at his terrified friend.

                         HOOKER
               Don't worry, pal.  I knew it was my
               night.

     Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the
     room.  He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky
     night.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. GAMBLING JOINT

     Hooker and Crystal out on the street.

                         CRYSTAL
                    (irritated)
               Thanks for the evening, Hooker.  I
               can still make the 10 o'clock.  If
               you wanna spend 50 bucks on me
               again, mail it.

     She walks off down the street.

                         HOOKER
                    (going into his
                    pocket for more money)
               Hey wait a minute.
                    (he comes up with 30›)
               Aw, the hell with ya.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

     A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
     of the plant.  Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped
     young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.  We
     follow him through a maze of machinery to the service
     elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
     in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.

     INT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE

     The working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except
     for Combs, who sits somberly in his office.

                         GREER
               They found Mottola.  He was drunk
               in a dive in Joliet.  Never got on
               the train.

                         COMBS
                    (aggravated)
               I don't wanta hear about his day,
               Greer.  What happened to the money?

                         GREER
               He lost it to a coupla con artists
               on his way outa the spot.

                         COMBS
               How much?

                         GREER
               Twelve thousand.

     Combs sits in quiet thought for a second.  Finally:

                         COMBS
               All right.  Better get on the phone
               to New York.  See what the big mick
               wants to do about it.
                    (pause)
               I gotta pretty good idea, though.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON

     An agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the
     craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a
     second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the
     door.  Below the tiger, the word "FARO" appears.  There is a
     large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but
     Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him.

                                        CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE FARO ROOM

     In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which
     sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced
     Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
     abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
     already been played.  On the opposite side of the table,
     completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
     from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.  Although is
     clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is
     a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
     lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but
     contempt.

     Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying
     hard to make as little noise as possible.

                         FLOYD
               Doyle, can I see you a minute?

                         LONNEGAN
                    (not looking up from
                    the table)
               I'm busy, Floyd.

                         FLOYD
               It's important.  We had a little
               trouble in Chicago today.  One of
               our runners got hit for 12 grand.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (calmly)
               Which one?

                         FLOYD
               Mottola.

                         LONNEGAN
               You sure he didn't just pocket it?
     


                         FLOYD
               No, we checked his story with a
               tipster.  He was cleaned by two
               grifters on 47th.

                         LONNEGAN
               They workin' for anybody?

                         FLOYD
               I don't know.  Could be.  We're
               runnin' that down now.

                         LONNEGAN
               All right, mark Mottola up a little
               and put him on a bus.  Nothin'
               fancy, just enough to keep him from
               coming back.  Get some local people
               to take care of the other two.
                    (impassively)
               We gotta discourage this kinda thing.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     Hooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for
     wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments.  A young
     black woman, Louise, answers the door, holding a baby.

                         HOOKER
               Howdy, Louise.

                         LOUISE
                    (admiring Hooker in
                    his suit)
               Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a
               sharp hunky in them linens.  If you
               wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had
               class.

     Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an
     older black woman, Alva.  Alva has a hat on, obviously just
     about to go out.  Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the
     Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a
     game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back
     is to us.  An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio.

                         COLEMAN
               Turn that down, Leroy.

                         ALVA
               Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was
               somethin' to see today.

                         HOOKER
               I'll never be as good as that mark,
               Alva.

                         ALVA
               Well, we gonna hear all about it
               when we get back from church.
               Leroy, get your jacket on, boy.

     Leroy goes to get his jacket.  Louise is finished putting
     the baby to bed.

                         HOOKER
               You goin' to church now?

                         ALVA
               They been havin' late bingo down
               there.  I'm gonna call on the Lord
               for a little cash, while he's still
               payin' off.  Luther, you look in on
               that child from time to time, will
               ya?

     Luther nods that he will.  Alva, Leroy and Louise leave for
     church as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the
     table.  Luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does.
     We now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence.  He
     is called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share.

                         EIRIE KID
               Hey, Luther told me he was carrying
               a wad, but I didn't figure this much.

                         HOOKER
               Which way did he do, Eirie?

                         EIRIE KID
               Straight north.  He was gonna take
               it all and run.

                         HOOKER
                    (laughs)
               The bastard.  He can blow his nose
               all the way.

     They laugh again, but Luther doesn't share their enthusiasm.
     He watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze.

                         COLEMAN
               You're late.  Where you been?

                         HOOKER
                    (flopping into a chair)
               I had some appointments.

                         COLEMAN
                    (not fooled)
               How much did ya lose?

                         HOOKER
                    (after a pause)
               All of it.

                         COLEMAN
                    (pissed)
               In one goddamn night?  What are ya
               sprayin' money around like that for?
               You coulda been nailed.

                         HOOKER
               I checked the place out.  There
               weren't no dicks in there.

                         COLEMAN
               You're a con man, and you blew it
               like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to
               be no pimp.

                         HOOKER
               What's eatin' you?  I've blown
               money before.

                         COLEMAN
               No class grifter woulda' done it,
               that's all.

                         HOOKER
               You think my play is bad?

                         COLEMAN
               I think it's the best...

     Hooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread Coleman's
     intentions.

                         COLEMAN
               ...It's the only reason I ain't
               quit before now.

                         HOOKER
                    (bewildered)
               What?

                         COLEMAN
               I'm gettin' too slow for this
               racket.  I done the best I'm gonna
               do.  You hang on too long, you
               start embarrassin' yourself.

                         HOOKER
               What are you talkin' about?  We
               just took off the biggest score
               we've ever had.  We can do anything
               we want now.

                         COLEMAN
               It's nothin' compared to what you
               could be makin' on the Big Con.
               You're wastin' your time workin'
               street marks.

                         HOOKER
               Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run
               out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause
               we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you
               everything.  If you hadn't taught
               me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.

                         COLEMAN
                    (a little embarrassed)
               Aw hell, you sound like some
               goddamn sucker.  You know everything
               I know.  You got nothin' more to
               learn from me.

                         HOOKER
               But you played the Big Con.  You
               said it was nothin'.  A game for
               flakes and mama's boys.

                         COLEMAN
               And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a
               fool if you don't get into it.  A
               bigger fool than I was.
                    (pause, holding up
                    the money)
               I been lookin' for this one all my
               life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance
               to step out at the top.

     Hooker knows it's no use.

                         HOOKER
                    (after a long silence)
               What the hell you gonna do with
               yourself?

                         COLEMAN
               Aw, I got a brother down in K.C.,
               runs a freight outlet.  I can go
               halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too
               exciting, but it's mostly legal.

     Hooker just nods.

                         COLEMAN
               Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't
               turn ya out if ya weren't ready.
                    (flipping Hooker a
                    piece of paper)
               I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I
               want you to look up.  There ain't a
               better insideman alive.  He'll
               teach ya everything ya gotta know.

                         HOOKER
               You'll take a cut of what I make,
               won't ya?

                         COLEMAN
               I'm out, Johnny.

                         HOOKER
               If that's the way you want it.

                         COLEMAN
               That's the way I want it.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

     It's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the
     street together, not really ready to go home, but with no
     other ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly
     strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it
     burn out.  He does this several times.

                         HOOKER
               How do you like that Coleman, huh?
               After three years.

                         EIRIE KID
               Aw come on, it was the only thing
               to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya
               back.

                         HOOKER
               We were partners.  If it weren't
               for Luther I'd still be hustlin'
               pinball down at Gianelli's.  I
               don't need anything more than I got.

                         HOOKER
               You ain't gonna have nothin' if you
               don't lay off them games of chance.
               There's a depression on ya know.

                         HOOKER
               There's always a depression on.

                         EIRIE KID
               If you saved a little, you wouldn't
               have to grift so much.

                         HOOKER
               I like griftin'.

                         EIRIE KID
               You could buy yourself some things.
               Clothes, or a nice car...

                         HOOKER
               I don't look any good in clothes
               and I don't know how to drive.
               What else ya got to sell, Eirie?

                         EIRIE KID
               Forget it.

     They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car
     pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a
     uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck.

     Hooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly
     detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the
     street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up
     against a brick wall.  The two have met before.

                         HOOKER
               Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little
               slow down at the Bunco Department
               tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the
               dominoes?

                         SNYDER
               You scored blood money today,
               Hooker.  You need a friend.

                         HOOKER
                    (knocking Snyder's
                    hand away)
               Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to
               roll.

     Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it
     with an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of
     boxes and garbage cans.

                         HOOKER
                    (getting up slowly)
               You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been
               home with the flu all day.
                    (rising to a fuller height)
               You can stake out my toilet if you
               want.

     Bang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him
     to the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding
     Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants
     to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat
     him to a pulp.

                         SNYDER
                    (pulling Hooker out
                    of the heap and
                    smashing him against
                    the wall again)
               I'll tell ya what you did, smart
               boy.  You tied into a loaded mark
               on 47th across from Maxies.  You
               and Coleman played the switch for
               him and blew him off to a cab on
               49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers
               runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it
               woulda been perfect.

                         HOOKER
                    (startled by the information)
               You're crazy.  I'm not stupid
               enough to play for rackets money.

                         SNYDER
               Not intentionally maybe, but that
               don't make no difference to Lonnegan.
               He'll swat you like any fly.

                         HOOKER
               I'll square it with the fixer.

                         SNYDER
               Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I
               put the finger on ya.

     Snyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He
     says nothing; he's waiting for the price.

                         SNYDER
               I figure your end of the score was
               at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no
               matter what it was.
     


                         HOOKER
                    (lying)
               My end was only one.

                         SNYDER
                    (not taking the fake)
               Then you'll have to come up with
               another grand somewhere.

     Hooker is beat and he knows it.

                         HOOKER
               All right.

     He reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and
     counts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he
     didn't think Hooker had it.

                         SNYDER
                    (pocketing the money
                    and motioning his
                    partner to put his
                    gun away)
               You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use
               dyin' for 2 grand.

     Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start
     down the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the
     other direction.

                         EIRIE KID
               I thought you blew all your money.

                         HOOKER
               I did.  That stuff I gave him was
               counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the
               first place he tries to spend it.

     Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner.  Hooker
     suddenly takes off like a shot.

     INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

     He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth.
     There's already a woman in it.  Hooker rips open the door
     and throws her out.  Hurriedly, he begins to dial.

                         EIRIE KID
                    (standing outside the booth)
               What the hell you gonna do when
               Snyder rushes his finger right to
               Lonnegan?  You're committin'
               suicide, kid.

                         HOOKER
                    (waiting for the ring)
               Aw Christ, it doesn't make no
               difference now.  If Snyder knows
               about it so does everybody else.
               He never gets anything first...Damn,
               there's no answer at Luther's.

                         EIRIE KID
               Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever
               you do, don't go back to your place
               tonight, don't go anyplace you
               usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa
               town or somethin', but...

     Hooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and
     blasts out of the booth.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Eirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but
     he's giving away too many years and there's no stopping
     Hooker at this point.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHOTS OF HOOKER

     Pumping down the street.

     EXT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     Hooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the
     third floor.

     INT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

     Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs.
     He bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already
     open.  The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over
     chair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman.  Hooker goes
     slowly to the window.  He looks down into the courtyard and
     then suddenly sprints back out the door.  As we hear him
     scrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window
     and looks out.

     EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

     There on the concrete below, face down, is the body of
     Luther Coleman.  Hooker races out to it and kneels down.

                         HOOKER
                    (shaking the body)
               C'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta
               get up, Luther.

     In the distance, sirens are heard.  Heads are out of the
     windows and some people are starting to gather in the
     courtyard.

                         HOOKER (CONT'D)
               Goddamn you, Luther, will you get
               up?
                    (pounding on the body)
               I'm not waitin' for you, Luther.
               I'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up,
               you son of a bitch.  Goddamn you,
               Luther, goddamn.

     The sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from
     Luther and runs.  The others gather to look at the body.

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     THE SET-UP

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     INT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY

     We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
     station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely
     distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A
     station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by
     and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet
     with a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain,
     as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
     victim.

     Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker
     struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
     situation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit,
     but it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as
     empty as he'd remembered it.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY

     Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks
     through several small novelties, till he finds what he's
     looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge.
     He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none,
     slips the badge into his pocket.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY

     Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks
     his hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it
     seems to revitalize him a little.

                                        CUT TO:

     STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle
     prohibits us from reading it.

     INT. STATION - DAY

     He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the
     crowded passenger lobby.  After scanning the area carefully
     for a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business
     man, who's busy reading the schedule board.

                         HOOKER
                    (flashing open his
                    wallet to reveal the
                    little tin badge and
                    then closing it again quickly)
               Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept...
               I'd like to ask you a few questions.

                         MAN
                    (flustered)
               What for?  I haven't done anything.

                         HOOKER
               We don't doubt that, but there's a
               counterfeiting operation passing
               bad money in the station.  Have you
               made any purchases here today?

                         MAN
                    (reluctantly)
               Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
     


                         HOOKER
               Then I'm afraid we'll have to
               impound your money until we're sure
               that it's all good.  Can I see your
               wallet and your ticket, please?

                         MAN
                    (handing them over)
               But I got a train to make.

                         HOOKER
                    (taking out the money
                    and returning the wallet)
               It'll only take 20 minutes or so.
               You can pick it up at the window
               down the hall.

                         MAN
               But what about all these other
               people?

                         HOOKER
                    (blowing up)
               We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance.
               I'm not the only agent in here, ya
               know.  We go around advertising
               ourselves, how many counterfeiters
               do you think we'd catch, huh?
                    (pointing to his suit)
               You think I'm wearin' this rag here
               'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody
               thinks life's a holiday or somethin'
               when you got a badge.
                    (pouring it on)
               I been here since three this
               morning, Charlie, and I never knew
               there was so much ugliness in
               people.  You try to help 'em and
               they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya
               go and gotten yourself arrested for
               passin' false notes.

     The Businessman is totally shamed.

                         MAN
               I'm sorry, really I am, but my
               train leaves in ten minutes.

                         HOOKER
               All right, I'll give ya a break.
                    (pointing to a hall)
               Down that hall there, there's an
               unmarked door on the left.  Go on
               in there and wait at the window.
               I'll take this...
                    (he holds up the money)
               ...in the back and run it through
               right away.  We'll have you outta
               there in a couple minutes.

                         MAN
               Thank you.  You don't know how much
               I appreciate this.

                         HOOKER
                    (with a little wave)
               Think nothin' of it.

     The man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be
     given a break like this.  Hooker heads for the "back".  We
     follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door.  He
     strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall
     of busily flushing urinals.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. STATION - DAY - HOOKER

     Boarding the 8:10 for Chicago.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. STATION - DAY

     The Man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he
     could have missed that room.

     EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

     The street runs along side an elevated train track.  We pick
     up Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought
     with the money he just earned in the train station.

     He appears to be looking for an address, referring every now
     and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night
     before.  Finally he stops in front of an old three-story
     building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors
     and what appear to be apartments on the third floor.  He
     peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign
     of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in.

     A 35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the
     second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the
     morning paper.  She's eating an apple.  Although she has
     just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who
     is probably quite striking at other hours.  The sight of
     Hooker fazes her not at all.

                         HOOKER
               Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy
               named Henry Gondorff.  You know him?

                         BILLIE
                    (starting back up the stairs)
               No.

                         HOOKER
               Luther Coleman sent me.

     Billie stops and comes back down the stairs.  It's the first
     time she's stopped chewing.

                         BILLIE
                    (checking him out)
               You Hooker?

                         HOOKER
               Yeh.

                         BILLIE
               Why didn't you say so.  I thought
               maybe you was a copper or somethin'.

     She goes to a side door and unlocks it.

                         BILLIE
               It's the room in the back.  He
               wasn't expecting you so soon though.

     Hooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's
     something about Billie that makes him know that you don't ask.

     INT. CAROUSEL - DAY

     Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in
     the back and knocks on the door.  No answer.  He gives the
     door a little push and it swings open.

     INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

     The room inside if small and cluttered, consisting of a bed,
     a sink, and a bathroom, all covered by a layer of books,
     dirty clothes and beer bottles.  Draped over a chair, fully
     dressed, but completely passed out is the one and only Henry
     Gondorff.

                         HOOKER
                    (to himself)
               The great Henry Gondorff.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. A SHOWER - DAY

     Water blasting out of the fixture.  We see Gondorff, still
     fully clothed, sitting in the bottom of the shower, the
     spray streaming off his face.  An imposing figure, with deep
     set eyes and full beard, he just sits there stoically,
     looking like a soggy lumberjack.  Hooker, sitting on the
     floor between the toilet and the sink, watches listlessly.
     Finally --

                         GONDORFF
               Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

                         HOOKER
               You sober?

                         GONDORFF
               I can talk, can't I?

     Hooker makes no move to get up.  Gondorff struggles to his
     knees, turns off the water, and slumps back against the wall.
     The two men just look past each other a second.  Down in the
     bottom.

                         GONDORFF
               Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a
               real horse's ass.

                         HOOKER
               Yeh, Luther said you could teach me
               something.  I already know how to
               drink.

     Gondorff wipes his face with his hand.  His mood softens a
     little.

                         GONDORFF
                    (quietly)
               I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the
               best street worker I ever saw.

                         HOOKER
               He had you down as a big-timer.
               What happened?

                         GONDORFF
               Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida
               on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear.
               He thought he was gonna take over
               General Electric.  Some Chantoozie
               woke him up, though, and he put the
               feds on me.

                         HOOKER
               You mean you blew it.

                         GONDORFF
                    (pause)
               Luther didn't tell me you had a big
               mouth.

                         HOOKER
               He didn't tell me you was a fuck-
               up, either.
                    (Gondorff looks at
                    him coldly)
               You played the Big Con since then.

                         GONDORFF
               No, I lammed it around for a while
               while things cooled off.  Philly,
               Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.

     Hooker's disappointment is obvious.

                         GONDORFF
               But don't kid yourself, friend, I
               still know how.

     Hooker nods, unconvinced.

                         GONDORFF
                    (getting up from the
                    floor and emptying
                    the water out of his pockets)
               You gonna stay for breakfast, or do
               you already know how to eat?

                         HOOKER
                    (tired)
               I picked something up on the way.

                         GONDORFF
                    (sensing something)
               Lonnegan after you, too?

                         HOOKER
               I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.

                         GONDORFF
               You never do, kid.

     We go to Hooker.  He hadn't thought of that.

     EXT. A BEAUTIFUL OLD COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - LONG ISLAND -
     DAY

     Lonnegan, in plus fours and argyles sits on a bench as other
     members of his foursome tee off.  Floyd comes up to him.

                         FLOYD
               We got word from Chicago.  They got
               one of the grifters last night.
               The nigger.

                         LONNEGAN
               What about the other one?

                         FLOYD
               They're still looking for him.

                         LONNEGAN
               Who's got the contract?

                         FLOYD
               Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

                         LONNEGAN
               Hackers.

                         FLOYD
               They staked out the other guy's
               place last night, but he never
               showed.  They figure maybe he
               skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em
               up?

     Lonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench
     beside him.  Floyd sits gingerly.

                         LONNEGAN
               You see the guy in the red sweater
               over there?

     We cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little
     Irishman in a red sweater.  He was a good-time, friendly
     manner and a winning Irish smile.  We like him immediately.

                         LONNEGAN
               Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy
               we called him.  Runs a few
               protection rackets for Carnello
               while he's waiting for something
               bigger to come along.  Me and Danny
               been friends since we were six.
               Take a good look at that face,
               Floyd, cause if he ever finds out
               we let one lousy grifter beat us,
               you'll have to kill him and every
               other hood in Chicago who'd like to
               do the same thing.  You understand
               what I'm sayin'?

                         FLOYD
               Yes sir.

                         LONNEGAN
               Good lad.

     Lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome.  He
     exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball
     down the fairway.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY

     Gondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is
     pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the
     carousel building.  The morning light pours in, illuminating
     fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its
     massive oaken horses.  Hooker watches him go about his
     business.  Billie calls down from the mezzanine which
     surrounds the carousel.

                         BILLIE
               You feeling all right this morning,
               Henry?

                         GONDORFF
               Fine, Billie.

                         BILLIE
               You mind opening the round a little
               early today?  We got some business
               coming in before hours.

     Gondorff waves okay.

                         GONDORFF
                    (to Hooker)
               Great little countess, that Billie.
               Runs a good house up there, too.
               One of the few left that Luciano
               doesn't own.

     Gondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps,
     bearing and poles.  Hooker follows him.

                         HOOKER
                    (getting impatient)
               Gondorff, you gonna teach me the
               Big Con or not?

                         GONDORFF
                    (on his back, checking
                    underneath one of the horses)
               You didn't act much like you wanted
               to learn it.

                         HOOKER
               I wanna play for Lonnegan.

                         GONDORFF
                    (getting up)
               You know anything about him?

                         HOOKER
                    (exploding)
               Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else
               do I gotta know.

     Gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off.

                         HOOKER
                    (waving Gondorff off,
                    embarrassed at his
                    own outburst)
               Aw right, he runs the numbers outta
               the south side.

                         GONDORFF
                    (going over to start
                    the machinery)
               And a packing company, a chain of
               Savings and Loans and half the
               politicians in Chicago and New York.
               There ain't a fix in the world
               gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

                         HOOKER
               I'll take him anyway.

                         GONDORFF
                    (whirling on him)
               Why?

                         HOOKER
                    (like steel)
               'Cause I don't know enough about
               killin' to kill him.

     It's the right answer. Gondorff didn't know it himself until
     now.

                         GONDORFF
               You can't do it alone, ya know.  It
               takes a mob of guys like you and
               enough money to make 'em look good.

                         HOOKER
               We'll get by without 'em.

                         GONDORFF
               This isn't like playin' winos on
               the street.  You gotta do more than
               outrun the guy.

                         HOOKER
                    (incensed)
               I never played for winos.

                         GONDORFF
                    (going right on,
                    ignoring Hooker's remark)
               You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even
               after you spent his money.  And no
               matter how much you take from his,
               he'll get more.

                         HOOKER
               You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?

                         GONDORFF
               Right down to my socks, turkey.  If
               I'da been half as scared a that
               lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep
               on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me,
               but at least he won't bore me to
               death.

                         HOOKER
               Then you'll do it?

                         GONDORFF
               If I can find a mob that'll risk it.
               But no matter what happens, I don't
               want you comin' back to me halfway
               through and sayin' it's not enough...
               cause it's all you got.

     Hooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
     back to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
     sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

                                        CUT TO:

     Music begins and we are into a short:

     MONTAGE SEQUENCE

     Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
     Gondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
     which is his trademark.  We begin with --

     A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
     the railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
     small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
     Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
     for.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
     makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
     a gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
     returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
     on by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
     public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
     other.

     INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

     Hooker in, having his hair cut and his nails manicured.
     Gondorff gives instructions to the barber.

     INT. HABERDASHERY - DAY

     Hooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror.  He
     doesn't look too pleased, but Gondorff peels out a bankroll
     anyway.

     EXT. HOTEL - DAY

     A pair of white spats stepping off a bus.  We follow them
     into a:

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY

     Where we tilt up to reveal J.J. Singleton, the most
     flamboyant of the bunch.  On his way to the check-in desk,
     he silently exchanges the "office" with Gondorff, who is
     sitting on a lounge reading the paper.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old
     woman.  It consists of a bed, a table and a sink.  Hooker
     nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill.  He
     takes another look around the room and decides to go out
     somewhere, but first he wedges a small piece of paper
     between the door and the jamb, about an inch off the floor.

     INT. A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY

     We hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, Eddie Niles, in
     the process of counting a large deposit.  Niles is all
     business; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it.  He
     glances up for a second and sees Gondorff "officing" him
     from across the bank.  Without a word he shoves the money
     he's been counting back into the hands of a startled
     customer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his
     identification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of
     the bank.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT

     This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the
     storage room.  It contains the water heater, mops and
     brooms, old bed springs, etc.  In the middle of the room a
     space has been cleared for a table, around which are seated
     Hooker, Gondorff, Niles, Singleton and Twist.  Gondorff is
     in his T-shirt, but still wears his hat.  Kid Twist is in a
     suit as usual.  The room is illuminated by a single bare
     bulb hanging from the ceiling.

                         TWIST
                    (showing Hooker
                    photographs of three men)
               These are Combs' favorite torpedoes.
               Riley and Cole.

     We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into
     Mottola's cab.

                         TWIST
               They do most of the small jobs, but
               Lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on
               you 'cause they're kinda messy.  No
               class.

     We go to Hooker.  He's real grateful.  Billie, wearing an
     evening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the
     empty beer mugs on the table.

                         TWIST
               We got reason to believe Riley was
               the guy who hit Luther.  But if you
               see either one of these two, find
               yourself a crowd, or take 'em
               someplace you know you can handle
               'em.

                         GONDORFF
               But most of all let us know.  If
               they got a hit on you, we gotta
               fold up the con.  You're too
               exposed.  You got that?

     Hooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that.

                         HOOKER
               You sure it'll be one of these two?

                         TWIST
               No.  They're just the only ones we
               know of.

     Billie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room
     with them.  We follow her down the hall and into the:

     RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL

     Carousel music filters up from the arcade below.  The room
     has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
     up by tables and couches.  It's a comfortable place, but not
     opulent.  Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches,
     others play canasta at the tables.  Most of the men are at
     the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand.  Billie
     comes over to the bar.

                         BILLIE
                    (to the bartender)
               Set me up five more beers, will ya
               Danny.

     As Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man
     at the end of the bar.

     We move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if
     he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what
     he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie.

                         SNYDER
               You the owner here?

                         BILLIE
               That's right.

                         SNYDER
                    (flipping out his badge)
               Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.

                         BILLIE
               Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut
               much up here.

                         SNYDER
                    (trying to ignore her remark)
               I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam
               from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought
               he mighta come in here.

                         BILLIE
               Don't think so.  I know everybody
               in the place and I always bounce
               the lamsters.

                         SNYDER
               All right if I look around your
               lobby?

                         BILLIE
               No, but you're welcome to a free
               beer before you go.

     Billie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass
     and pushes it over to Snyder.  He ignores the gesture.

                         SNYDER
                    (with controlled force)
               I don't really need your permission.

     We go to Billie.  She knew that when he came in.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

     The discussion continues.  Hooker, a bit out of his depth
     here, listens and stays silent.

                         SINGLETON
               Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's
               not gonna sit still for a standard
               play.

                         GONDORFF
               Everybody'll sit still for somethin'.
               What did ya find out about the
               train, Eddie?

                         NILES
               He's been taking the 8:10 Century
               Limited outa New York on Friday and
               getting in here early Saturday
               morning.  He usually stays a day to
               check on his policy operations, and
               then flies back.

                         GONDORFF
               Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

                         NILES
               The porters say he runs a braced
               card game in one of the cars.  $100
               minimum, straight poker.  Last time
               he pulled in here ten grand heavier
               than he left New York.

                         GONDORFF
               Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

                         TWIST
               Lotta plungers ride that train just
               to play him.

                         GONDORFF
                    (breaking into a smile)
               See J.J., he's slowly down already.

     THE RECEIVING ROOM AGAIN

     Snyder has completed his inspection of the "lobby" and found
     nothing.  Danny, meanwhile, has set up the five beers on a
     tray.

                         SNYDER
               Which way are the rooms?

                         BILLIE
               Who told ya this guy was in here?

                         SNYDER
               Nobody.  I just know what kinda
               women he likes.  I'm gonna check
               all the joyhouses till I find him.

                         BILLIE
               Maybe I could help ya if ya told me
               his name.

                         SNYDER
               I think I'll keep that to myself.
               Which way are the rooms?

                         BILLIE
               Right through there.  But I wouldn't
               go in there if I were you.
                    (picks up the tray)


                         SNYDER
                    (snidely)
               What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

                         BILLIE
               I don't have to.  You'll be bustin'
               in on the Chief of Police just up
               the hall.
                    (she exits with the drinks)


     Snyder is stopped cold.  He calls after her.

                         SNYDER
               Keep your nose clean, lady.  He
               can't spend all his time here.

     THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

     Billie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear, while
     the others talk.  His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker.

                         SINGLETON
               I think we ought to play him on the
               Rag.  It's the tightest game we
               got, and it's not all over the
               papers yet.

                         NILES
               No good, J.J.  You're not gonna con
               stocks to a banker.  Lonnegan's too
               smart for that.
     


                         TWIST
               What are you going to do, con the
               payoff to a gambler?

                         SNYDER
               Twist is right.  It won't work.

     Gondorff has nodded to Billie and now rejoins the
     conversation.  She serves the others beer.

                         GONDORFF
               We'll use the wire.  Never known a
               gambler who wouldn't like to beat
               the ponies.

                         NILES
               The wire is ten years outa date.

                         GONDORFF
               That's why he won't know it.

                         SINGLETON
               I'm not sure I know it.

                         GONDORFF
               We'll give him the hook on the
               train, and play him here.  You
               think I can get in that poker game,
               Eddie?

                         NILES
               All you gotta do is show up with
               some money and look like a fool.

                         GONDORFF
               I also gotta win.

     He looks at Hooker.  There is a challenge in their book.
     Gondorff smiles broadly, then casually, to them all.

                         GONDORFF
               By the way, any of you guys been
               passing off any green goods lately?

     We go around the table.  No reply.

                         GONDORFF
               Billie, if that Dick comes in
               again, stall him till I can get a
               look at him.  And let me pay ya for
               these beers.

                         BILLIE
               What are you talking about?  It's
               on the house.

                         GONDORFF
                    (pulling out a $5 bill)
               Naw, I want ya to have this.

     He hitches up Billie's skirt, and puts the bill in her garter.

                         GONDORFF
               Don't look at it till ya go to bed
               though or it'll turn to paper.

     Billie smiles and leaves the room.

     INT. HALLWAY

     She walks halfway down the hall and stops.  She can't wait.
     Lifting up her skirt, she finds that the five has indeed
     turned to paper.  As she breaks into laughter and continues
     on down the hall, we:

     FADE IN:

     THE HOOK

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     EXT. A SUNKEN ALLEY - DAY

     Actually little more than a service area between two
     apartment buildings.  Niles, Kid Twist, and a middle-aged
     black man, named Benny Garfield, enter the alley with an old
     man and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean
     basement.  A faded sign above the door says Stenner's
     Billiards.  We follow them inside to a:

     INT. A LARGE BARREN ROOM - DAY

     An office comes off it at one end.  Judging from the
     fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks
     which still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed,
     used to be a pool hall.  Niles and Garfield go all the way
     to the back, while Twist stays near the front with the old
     man.

                         NILES
               Looks all right.  It's big enough
               and off the street.

                         GARFIELD
               I don't know.  This is kinda short
               notice.  I'm not sure we can get it
               all done by Saturday.

                         NILES
               Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark
               in from New York on the Century.

     Garfield thinks it over a little.  He's taking another look
     at the place.  We go to Twist and the old man by the door.

                         TWIST
               We'll take it.
                    (pointing through the door)
               You manage the building at the end
               of the alley?

                         OLD MAN
                    (with pride)
               For fifteen years.

                         TWIST
               I'll need a room over there that
               faces this way.  How much a week?

                         OLD MAN
               Only rents by the month.  Two
               hundred and fifty for the two of
               them.

                         TWIST
                    (pulling out his wallet)
               This is the last time I expect to
               see you down here.

                         OLD MAN
                    (watching the bills
                    being counted into
                    his hand)
               Never heard of the place.

     We go back to Niles and Garfield.

                         GARFIELD
               Been a while since I stocked a wire
               store.  Not many mobs playing that
               anymore.

                         NILES
               All we need is the bookie setup for
               now.  We'll worry about the
               telegraph office later.

                         GARFIELD
               All right, I'll rent ya everything
               I got in the warehouse for two
               grand.  That'll give ya phones,
               cages, blackboards and ticker gear.
               You supply the guys to move 'em.
               If you want a counter and bar,
               that's another grand.  I don't know
               where the hell I'm gonna get 'em
               though.

                         NILES
               C'mon, you can do better than that.

               You want the stuff tomorrow or
               don't ya?  It's gonna take hours
               just to clean it up.
                    (pause)
               Besides, Gondorff's still a hot
               item.  Where am I gonna be if he
               gets hit?

                         NILES
               Just give us what ya can, Benny.
               We'll send a truck down.

     Twist has rejoined them by now.

     INT. A NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - DAY

     We pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and
     Floyd, making his way through the station.  He stops at a
     cigar counter to buy some cigarettes, and we reveal Gondorff
     and Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of
     the room.

                         GONDORFF
                    (eyes fixed on Lonnegan)
               Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey
               fedora.

     Hooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd.  We go back
     to Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward
     his train.  Hooker watches him with the intensity of one
     gazing on a religious object.

                         HOOKER
               He's not as tough as he'd like to
               think.

                         GONDORFF
                    (picking up his suitcase)
               Neither are we.

     EXT. TRAIN

     Lonnegan and his retainers getting on the train.  Two cars
     down the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also.  On
     his way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside.

                         GONDORFF
               I hear there's a friendly poker
               game on this train tonight.  You
               know anything about that?

                         CONDUCTOR
               A little.

                         GONDORFF
               You think you could get me in that
               game?

                         CONDUCTOR
               I don't know.  There's usually a
               waiting list.

     Gondorff flashes a $50 bill.

                         CONDUCTOR
                    (loosening up a bit)
               That'll get you first alternate, sir.

     Gondorff pulls out another fifty.
     


                         CONDUCTOR
                    (taking the money)
               I'll see what I can do.

     INT. A BASEMENT BAR - EARLY EVENING

     Kid Twist enters and threads his way through the maze of
     tables to a door at the back of the building.  A large bull
     of a man is stationed there, obviously to discourage those
     who don't have credentials to enter.  Twist is not such a man.

                         TWIST
                    (going right on through)
               How ya doin', Lacey.

                    (innocently pleased
                    for one so menacing)
               Good to see ya again, Twist.

     INT. ANOTHER ROOM - EARLY EVENING

     Inside is another room, this one much better lit than the
     outer one.  There are only three tables in here, around
     which are seated the elite of the Con World.  Twist is
     enthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau, a large, rotund
     man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as
     a powerful figure in this group.

                         BOUDREAU
               Twist!  When did you get back in
               town?

                         TWIST
               Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big
               one with Gondorff on the North Side.

     The two men sit down together, apart from the others.

                         TWIST
               Listen Duke, we're setting up a
               wire store.  I need a twenty man
               boost right away.

                         BOUDREAU
               I got twenty or so in here tonight.
               Take your pick.

                         TWIST
               These guys have gotta be the quill,
               Duky.  We can't afford to rank the
               joint.

                         BOUDREAU
                    (to one of his assistants)
               Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see
               who's in town.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN

     A silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway.  The
     word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls
     still.  The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a
     buzzer goes off in the back room.  Boudreau gets up from his
     table and opens a small viewing port in the door.

     The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
     tables.  It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the
     place.

                         BOUDREAU
               Twist, you know this guy?

                         TWIST
                    (taking a look
                    through the viewing port)
               No.  Never saw him before.  He's a
               dick, though.

     Snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his
     route.  About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables,
     recognizing a grifter he knows.  It's the Eirie Kid.

                         EIRIE KID
               Hello, Snyder.  What are you doin'
               up here?

                         SNYDER
               I'm on vacation.  You seen your
               friend lately?

                         EIRIE KID
               Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled
               in detective school.

     Snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and
     slams his face into the table.  Eirie just stays there; he
     knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective.  Twist is
     watching all this intently from the viewing port.

                         SNYDER
               You see him, you tell him to pay
               his debts before I get him.

     Eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing.  There is a
     slight trickle of blood from his nose.  Snyder turns and
     walks slowly out of the bar.  When he is a safe distance
     down the street, the chatter and drinking resume.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN

     Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
     where he and Boudreau were talking.  Boudreau reads from a
     list of names.  Twist listens with a certain preoccupation.
     He's still thinking about the little confrontation he just
     witnessed.

                         BOUDREAU
               Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the
               Big Alabama are in from New Orleans.
               Fiskin and the Boone Kid from
               Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and
               Limehouse Chappie from New York.
               Those and the guys outside should
               give ya 30 or so to choose from.

                         TWIST
               Good, have 'em down at Stenner's
               old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're
               gonna run through the route tonight.

                         BOUDREAU
               Okay, Twist, but you know if this
               blows up, I can't do ya no good
               downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.

                         TWIST
               Don't worry about it, pal.

     INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

     Singleton is walking down a passageway and stops at a door
     and goes in.

     INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

     Gondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places.
     He is alone.  He looks up as Singleton enters.

                         SINGLETON
               You in?

                         GONDORFF
               Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay-
               ducer a C-note.  You find out the
               deck?

                         SINGLETON
               He usually plays with a Royal or a
               Cadenza.
                    (handing him two
                    sealed decks)
               I got you one of each.  He likes to
               cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

                         GONDORFF
               Nice work, J.J.

     Singleton slips out as Gondorff unpeels the packs.

     INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

     We pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked
     by only one bodyguard and Floyd.  He starts through the
     passenger section toward the compartment where the poker
     game will be held.  Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering
     around the corner and bumps into him.

     They grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust.

                         WOMAN
                    (sloppy drunk)
               Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug.
               If I'da wanted you handlin' me I
               woulda asked ya.

     Lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway.  As
     the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers,
     we see it is Billie.  She drops something on a seat beside a
     passenger.  A hand reaches to pick it up.  It is Lonnegan's
     wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up.

     Hooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction
     Lonnegan has taken.  He passes by the open door to the card
     room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings
     exchanged inside before the door is shut.  Then he continues
     on into the next car.  He turns into Gondorff's compartment.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

     Gondorff is still practicing.  He looks up as Hooker enters
     and tosses him the wallet.

                         HOOKER
               She got him clean.  He hasn't
               missed it.

     Gondorff nods, takes the money out, counts it.

                         GONDORFF
               Fifteen grand.  Looks like he's
               expecting a big night.

     He takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it, and
     tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker, and resumes his
     shuffling and dealing.  Hooker sits back silently and
     watches him.

                         HOOKER
               He's waitin' for you in the card
               room.

                         GONDORFF
               Let him wait.

     As he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the
     bottom, muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the
     table.  Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back
     up.  Gondorff finally meets his gaze.

                         GONDORFF
               You just worry about your end, kid.

                         HOOKER
               If we ever get to it.

     and seated.  They're getting slightly impatient.

     GONDORFF'S CABIN AGAIN

     Gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing.  He
     grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands.
     He then picks up a half-full bottle of bourbon.  Hooker
     gives him a disapproving look.  Gondorff smiles and pats
     some on his face.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE POKER ROOM AGAIN

     Everybody's itchy now.

                         LONNEGAN
               All right, let's start without him.
               Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

     The Conductor hands him a sealed deck.  As he begins to open
     it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven
     and looking slightly tipsy.  The others at the table, all
     men of high school or financial standing, are somewhat put
     off.

                         GONDORFF
               Sorry I'm late boys.  I was takin'
               a crap.

     This bit of grossness does little to improve his image.

                         CONDUCTOR
                    (making the
                    introductions;
                    referring first to Gondorff)
               Mr. Shaw is a bookmaker from
               Chicago.  Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.
               Clayton from Pittsburgh, Mr.
               Jameson, Chicago, Mr. Lonnegan, New
               York and Mr. Lombard, Philadelphia.

     Gondorff nods and takes a seat, none too gracefully.

                         CONDUCTOR
               Straight poker, gentlemen.  100
               dollar minimum, table stakes.  We
               assume you're good for your debts.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (shuffling the cards)
               Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie
               at this table.  If you don't have
               one, we can get ya one.

                         GONDORFF
               Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr.
               Lonneman.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (irritated)
               Lonnegan.

     He begins to deal, obviously not pleased that his evening
     seems to be peopled with drunks.

     Now a blaze of activity.  We take several cuts of workmen
     papering the walls, tacking down carpet, putting in new
     light fixtures, painting signs, all under the supervision of
     Niles.  From now on, we will refer to the pool hall as the
     store.

     Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one,
     a group of con men lined up outside the office door.  A
     gray-haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table
     which is serving Twist as a desk.  Curly is practically in
     rags and has several days growth on his face.  He wears a
     little beret which he takes off to address Twist.

                         CURLY
               Name's Curly Jackson.  I worked for
               Gad Bryan outa Baltimore.

                         TWIST
               You ever played the Wire, Curly?

                         CURLY
               Used to rope for it long ago.  I
               can shill, mark board, anything you
               want.  I don't run with riffraff
               and I only drink on weekends.
                    (affecting an English accent)
               Me specialty is an Englishman.

     Twist is taken with the man, despite his appearance.

                         TWIST
               All right, Curly, you're in.  We
               got a rack of suits over there.
               Get yourself a nice tweed one.

                         CURLY
                    (exiting)
               That's all right.  I got all my own

     Gondorff and Lonnegan have most of the chips.  Lonnegan is
     slightly ahead.  Gondorff has made a token attempt to wear
     the provided tie, having tied it in a knot around his neck,
     but not having bothered to put it under his collar.  He has
     a shot glass and a bottle next to him, from which he has
     been drinking heavily.  He and Lonnegan are the only ones
     left in this hand.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (throwing chips in)
               Raise 500.

                         GONDORFF
                    (likewise)
               See ya and raise three.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (more chips)
               See and raise five.

                         GONDORFF
               Five and call.

     Lonnegan lays down his hand, a solid two pair.  Gondoroff
     turns out three tens.  Lonnegan is beat.

                         GONDORFF
               Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's
               what you get for playin' with your
               head up your ass.  Couple more like
               that and we can all go to bed
               early, huh boys.

     Lonnegan burns, and the "boys" have no comment.

     INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

     The work is still progressing.  We see two workmen installing
     a ticket tape machine in a secluded area of the store.

                         GARFIELD
               We bought ya a tap into Moe
               Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at
               every track in the country.  You'll
               get race results, odds, scratches,
               pole positions, everything; and
               just as fast as Western Union gets
               'em.

                         NILES
               Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

                         GARFIELD
               All he's gotta do is read.

     We go to Kid Twist, still conducting interviews in the
     office.  A young, rather sullen man, Buck Duff, steps to the
     table.

                         DUFF
               Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's
               boost in Troy.

                         TWIST
               You the Duff that didn't come up
               with his end when Little Jeff was
               sent up?

                         DUFF
               Wasn't no problem a mine.

                         TWIST
               He was a con man, wasn't he?

                         DUFF
               He was a tear-off rat.  He got what
               he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay
               his bills.

                         TWIST
                    (like ice)
               Shove off, Duff.

     Duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the
     table.  He stops however, by the door.  The next man up is
     the Eirie Kid.  Twist knows he's seen him somewhere before.

                         EIRIE KID
                    (nervous as hell)
               Names's Joe Eirie.

     Twist waits for more, but it's not coming.

                         TWIST
               You played for any particular mobs?

                         EIRIE KID
               No.

                         TWIST
               You know the Wire at all?

                         EIRIE KID
               No...I never played no Big Con
               before.  But Luther Coleman was a
               friend a mine.  I thought maybe
               there was something I could do.

                         TWIST
                    (pointing to Eirie
                    slightly swollen nose)
               You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's
               tonight?

     Eirie nods a reluctant "yes."

                         TWIST
               You got moxie, Eirie.  Get yourself
               a suit.

     Eirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you.
     Buck Duff, enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur,
     turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store.

     THE CARD GAME AGAIN

     The room is dense with smoke now, and the players are
     feeling the heat.  Gondorff has his white shirt open,
     revealing a stained T-shirt underneath.  The bottle next to
     him is almost empty.  He sneezes and wipes his nose with the
     tie Lonnegan gave him.

     The chips are now about equally divided between Gondorff and
     Lonnegan.  The others are losing badly.

                         GONDORFF
               Raise 300.

                         LONNEGAN
               Pass.

                         JAMESON
                    (throwing in his last
                    few chips)
               Raise 200.

                         GONDORFF
               Two and call.

     Jameson lays down two pair.  Gondorff has a flush.  Gondorff
     rakes in the chips, which now put him ahead of Lonnegan.

                         JAMESON
               Well, I'm out.

                         GONDORFF
               Don't worry about it, pal.  Lemongan
               here wouldn'ta let you in the game
               if you weren't a chump.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (getting to his feet)
               I've had enough of your lip, Shaw.

     Gondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him, breaks it
     against the table and waves the jagged end in Lonnegan's face.

                         GONDORFF
                    (barely able to stand up)
               Just take it easy there, Larrabee.

     Jameson and the conductor step in between.

                         JAMESON
               Let's take a break for a couple
               minutes and cool off.

     Lonnegan storms out of the room, followed by Floyd and
     Bodyguard.

     INT. SMOKING ROOM

     We pick up Lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the
     smoking room.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (to his assistant)
               I've had it with that bum, Floyd.
               Stack me a cooler.

                         FLOYD
                    (trying to settle him down)
               You've only been playin three
               hours, Doyle.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (not to be pacified)
               I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set
               it up for threes and nines.  I'll
               cut it in on his deal.

                         FLOYD
                    (taking a deck and
                    beginning to sort it)
               What do ya want the others to get?

                         LONNEGAN
               Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there
               early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard
               in one play.

     INT. THE POKER ROOM AGAIN - NIGHT

     A pair of hands shuffling.  We pull back to reveal that
     they're Gondorff's.  He passes the deck to Lonnegan to be
     cut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle.  Lonnegan takes
     the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck,
     while making it look like he's cutting the old one.

     Gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal.  As the hand
     is picked up, we see that Gondorff has four threes, Lonnegan
     four nines, and everybody else has nothing.

                         CLAYTON
                    (opening the bidding)
               Fold.

                         LONNEGAN
               250.

                         GONDORFF
               Raise 1,000.

                         LONNEGAN
               Raise 500.

     Gondorff looks at Lonnegan very carefully for a second.
     Lonnegan meets his stare.

                         GONDORFF
                    (slowly)
               Raise 2,000.

     The spectators shift a little.  It's the biggest bet of the
     night.

                         LONNEGAN
               See and raise 1,000.

                         GONDORFF
                    (taking it to him)
               Raise 5,000.

     Lonnegan fingers his remaining chips.  He knows he's won,
     but he wants to bleed it for every bit of suspense.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (going for broke)
               See, and raise the rest.

     Lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips.  Gondorff, who is
     only required to match Lonnegan's total, throws in all his
     too.  It's a showdown.

                         GONDORFF
               Call.

     Lonnegan puts down his four nines.  Gondorff just stares at
     them a second, lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks.
     Lonnegan is aghast.  This just can't be.  He glances at
     Floyd, who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open.

                         GONDORFF
                    (raking in the chips)
               Well that's all for me tonight,
               boys.  I'm gonna leave ya some cab
               fare.

     The other players look at each other in disgust, and reach
     for their wallets, all of which are well stocked.

                         GONDORFF
                    (to Lonnegan)
               You owe me 15 grand, pal.

     Lonnegan, with a stare that could kill, reaches for his
     wallet.  Suddenly the stare goes soft.  He tries a few more
     pockets.  No soap.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (getting up to get it)
               I guess I left it in my room.

                         GONDORFF
                    (blowing up)
               What!  Don't give me that crap you
               little weenie.  How do I know you
               ain't gonna take a powder.
                    (waving his wallter,
                    which is full of
                    Lonnegan's money)
               You come to a game like this, you
               bring your money.

     Lonnegan, having had all he can take, goes for Gondorff, but
     is restrained by the conductor.

                         GONDORFF
               All right, buddy, I'm gonna send a
               boy by your room in five minutes,
               and you better have that jack, or
               it's gonna be all over Chicago that
               your name ain't worth a dime.

     Gondorff stalks out of the room.  We pick him up coming down
     the passageway to his compartment.

     INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT

     The drunkenness has vanished.  We follow him into his cabin,
     where Hooker is waiting anxiously.

                         HOOKER
               How'd ya do?

                         GONDORFF

               Well we got some workin' money
               anyway.

     Gondorff tosses his winnings on the table.

                         GONDORFF
                    (big smile)
               Okay, kid, you're on.  But I gotta
               tell ya, its a hard act to follow.

     INT. LONNEGAN'S CABIN - NIGHT

     Lonnegan sits in a chair smoking, obviously still upset.
     Floyd paces in front of him.

                         FLOYD
               I know I give him four threes.  We
               can't let him get away with that.

                         LONNEGAN
               What am I supposed to do?  Call him
               for cheating better than me?

     There's a knock at the door.  Floyd goes and opens it.  It's
     Hooker.

                         HOOKER
               My name's Carver.  Mr. Shaw sent me.

     Floyd motions him in without a word.

                         LONNEGAN
               Your boss is quite a card player,
               Carver.  How does he do it?

                         HOOKER
                    (very matter-of-factly)
               He cheats.

     Lonnegan says nothing.  He doesn't like smart asses.  He
     looks Hooker over a second, as if considering whether to
     have him wasted or not.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (reaching into his
                    coat pocket)
               He'll have to take a check.
                    (pulling out a check)
               I couldn't find my wallet.

                         HOOKER
               Yeh, he knows that.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (startled)
               What do you mean?

                    Lonnegan's wallet and
                    tossing it to him)
               He hired a dame to take it from ya.

     Lonnegan just holds the wallet.  He can't believe it.
     


                         HOOKER
               You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's
               been planning to beat your game for
               months.  He was just waiting for
               you to cheat him so he could clip ya.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (the heat rising)
               I could have you put under this
               train for this, errand boy.

                         HOOKER
                    (cool as hell)
               So could Shaw.

                         LONNEGAN
               Then why the rat?

                         HOOKER
               Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.
                    (pause)
               I want you to help me break him.

     Lonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard, as if the intensity
     of his gaze could separate truth from fiction.  Lonnegan
     hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be
     on the level.  The silence is suddenly broken by the noise
     of the train braking into the station.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (to Hooker)
               C'mon, I'll give ya a lift home.

     Hooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not.

                         LONNEGAN
               What's the matter?  You gotta get
               back to Shaw?

                         HOOKER
               Naw, he picked up some jane in the
               bar.  Can't see him till morning
               anyway.

                         LONNEGAN
               All right, then.

     INT. LONNEGAN'S CAR - NIGHT

     Driving through the city, the driver and Floyd in front,
     Hooker and Lonnegan in back.

     Hooker glances out the window from time to time, just to
     make sure they're really going to his place.

                         LONNEGAN
               Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa
               enemies to choose from.

                         HOOKER
               I need somebody respectable...but
               not completely legit.  What I'm
               gonna do isn't very legal.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (insulted)
               I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit
               in this state.

                         HOOKER
               All you gotta do is place a bet for
               me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply
               all the money and the information.

     Lonnegan is listening, but you'd never know it.

                         HOOKER
               If you help me out, I'll pay ya
               back the money you owe Shaw, myself.

                         LONNEGAN
               That's worth fifteen grand to ya?

                         HOOKER
               Maybe a couple million.

     We go to Lonnegan.  He's still not talking, but that last
     phrase has registered.

     EXT. HOOKER'S PLACE

     The car pulls up in front of Hooker's place.

                         LONNEGAN
               You're dreamin', kid.

                         HOOKER
                    (getting out)
               660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at
               12:30, if you're interested.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (diffidently)
               If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm
               not coming.

     Hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building.
     Lonnegan's car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight.
     Hooker breathes a sigh of relief.  He's passed his first
     test; or has he?  We follow him up the stairs to his room.

     INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

     He's just about to unlock the door, when he notices the
     little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor.
     Without the slightest hesitation, Hooker leaps over the
     bannister and races back down the stairs.  Two gunmen, Riley
     and Cole, burst out of his room and fire at him over the
     railing, but he's already too far down.  Riley and Cole give
     chase.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

     Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the
     sidewalk.  There is an empty bus stopped at a light, but
     they find no sign of Hooker.  As the light changes, we cut
     to the other side of the bus, where we see Hooker crouched
     on the rear wheel housing, hanging on to a vent.  He's a
     little shaken, but most of all, he's still alive.  We hold
     on him, as the bus moves off.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               Everything go all right?

                         HOOKER (V.O.)
                    (lying)
               Yeh, it was easy.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

     Hooker and Gondorff are sitting alone in the back office
     while the work goes on outside.  Their conversation continues.

                         GONDORFF
               No signs of trouble?

                         HOOKER
               What do ya mean?

                         GONDORFF
               You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A
               torpedo or somethin'.

                         HOOKER
                    (wanting to get off
                    the subject)
               No, not a thing.

     Gondorff has his doubts, but lets them ride.

                                        CUT TO:

     OTHER PARTS OF THE STORE

     We concentrate on some of the fine details, i.e. Garfield
     explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and
     Billie; Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark
     the odds board properly.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               How 'bout Lonnegan?

                         HOOKER (V.O.)
               I gave him the breakdown just like
               ya told me to.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               And?

                         HOOKER (V.O.)
               He threatened to kill me.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               Hell, they don't do that and you
               know you're not gettin' through to
               'em.

     We concentrate on Niles, who's making up the "boodles" or
     fake bankrollls.  He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom,
     then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another
     $100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a
     whole stack of $100 bills.  The bundle is then bound with a
     sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000.
     We see that he has already made several of these bundles.

                         HOOKER (V.O.)
               Then he drove me home.  He tried to
               put himself away as legit, so I
               went right into the pitch.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               Did he hold you up on anything?
     


                         HOOKER (V.O.)
               Naw, he just sat there and listened.
               I don't know if he bought it or not.

     INT. THE STORE

     Twist in the middle of the room giving a route to the Eirie
     Kid.  He shows him where to get his drink at the bar, where
     to sit and finally how to leap up and throw his racing form
     down in disgust.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               That's all right.  Once they start
               listening, they're in trouble.
               Just don't give him more than he
               asks for.  If you rattle his
               imagination a little, he'll come up
               with all the right answers himself.
               But all he's gotta do is catch you
               in one lie and you're dead.

     HOOKER AND GONDORFF IN THE STORE OFFICE AGAIN

     They both look tired.

                         HOOKER
               You think he'll show?

                         GONDORFF
               Did he say he wouldn't?

                         HOOKER
               No.

                         GONDORFF
                    (softly)
               He'll show.

     WE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE

     At first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a
     figure in an upper window of the apartment building which
     forms one side of the alley.  It's Kid Twist.  His eyes roam
     the street, for what, we do not yet know.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY

     Probably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its
     large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and
     Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone.
     Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously
     alternates his glances between the clock and the empty
     street outside.  It's 12:52.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE STORE - DAY

     The place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so
     as not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we
     concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more
     familiar people:

     Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area.
     Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just
     stares out into space cracking his knuckles.

                         GONDORFF
               Eddie, cut that out, will ya.

     The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of
     his odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops
     to cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already
     crossed, but he does it again anyway.

     Billie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the
     room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The
     clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store.

     Curly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke
     on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle.

     A couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits
     and primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks
     beside her.

     The Eirie Kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he
     has it down.

     Despite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement,
     save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars
     and cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting
     to go on opening night.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN

     It's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two
     large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door,
     and take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at
     him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to
     take their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but
     is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with
     them.  Suddenly, a voice.

                         VOICE
               Carver?

     Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the
     booth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one
     behind that.

                         LONNEGAN
               You should always look to the back
               too, kid.

                         HOOKER
                    (sliding out of his
                    booth and into Lonnegan's)
               I was afraid you weren't gonna come.
               We haven't got much time.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (curtly)
               Get on with it then.

                         HOOKER
                    (pointing to telephone)
               Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna
               call here and give you the name of
               a horse.
                    (pulling out a wad of bills)
               All you do is take this two grand
               across the street to Shaw's place
               and bet it on that pony.  There's
               nothin' to it, but don't take too
               much time.  We only have 3 or 4
               minutes after you get the call.

                         LONNEGAN
               You're not gonna break him with a
               $2,000 bet.

                         HOOKER
               This is just a test.  The big one
               comes later.  Be careful with that
               though, it's all I got.

                         LONNEGAN
               And you were gonna pay me back?

                         HOOKER
               I am after this race.

     Lonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's
     stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race.

                         HOOKER
               I gotta get back before Shaw misses
               me.  Good luck.

     EXT. STREET

     Hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley.

     INT. DRUGSTORE

     Lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles
     back in his seat to wait for the phone.

     OUTSIDE STORE

     As Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives
     Kid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and
     looks at his watch.  12:58.

                                        CUT TO:

     DRUGSTORE

     Lonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the
     salt shaker.  It's 1:40.  A man enters the store and walks
     over to use the phone.

                         LONNEGAN
               We're waitin' for a call.

     The man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four
     goons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE STORE

     Kid Twist again.  Billie enters the room with a piece of
     paper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the
     pohne and begins to dial.

     INT. DRUGSTORE

     Lonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a
     cigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly
     and we hear:

                         TWIST
               Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose.

     The receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs
     up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage.

     EXT. STREET

     We follow him across the street and into the alley, where he
     signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid
     Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes
     off inside the store.  The previously inert figures there
     spring to life.

     Lonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at
     the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of
     host.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to
     Lonnegan.

     INT. THE STORE

     As Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in
     its entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a
     swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered
     furniture and chandeliers.

                         SINGLETON
               Look at that.  He's got four apes
               with him.

                         GONDORFF
               That's what I like about these
               guys, J.J... They always got
               protection against things we'd
               never do to 'em.

     Everywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes
     incessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone,
     taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people.

                         SHEET WRITER
               Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing
               Cloud.

     We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch,
     which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a
     partition.

     The boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding
     wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard.
     From the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash." The
     odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1.

     Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting
     line.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the
     room.  The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost")
     consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course
     are what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with
     pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers
     with goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of
     money are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are
     in sight everywhere.

     Lonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat
     estranged from the general merriment around him.  There are
     two men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson,
     slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's
     the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff
     appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan.

                         GONDORFF
               Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd
               think you'd get tired of losin',
               Honnigan.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (piercingly)
               The name is Lonnegan.

                         GONDORFF
                    (to Niles)
               Make sure you see cash from this
               guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for
               bettin' money he don't have.

     The man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud.
     He makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window.

                         LONNEGAN
               Two-thousand on Bluenote.

                         NILES
                    (writing out a ticket)
               Is that all?

                         LONNEGAN
                    (pissed)
               That's all.

     Bluenote's race is now up on the board.  The race caller
     comes on the loudspeaker.

                         CALLER
               Ladies and Gentlemen.  This is
               Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
               second race at Belmont in New York.
               A mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and
               up.  And they're off!

     We see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling
     the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage.

                         CALLER
               Around the first turn it's a War
               Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate
               second by one and a half, Dancing
               Cloud third by a half on the
               outside, followed by Lucky Lady,
               Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote.

     Lonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down
     at one of the tables.  It happens to be the one the Eirie
     Kid is at.  Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's
     cage.

                         GONDORFF
                    (worried)
               That's not where we want him to sit.

     Eirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he
     better make some conversation.

                         EIRIE KID
               C'mon War Eagle.
                    (to Lonnegan)
               That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a
               finisher.  War Eagle's gonna have
               to open up a little more on 'em.

                         LONNEGAN
               You know anything about a horse
               named Bluenote?

                         EIRIE KID
               Naw, he's never done much.  Probably
               in here just to round out the field.
               War Eagle's where you wanna have
               your money.

     Eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar.

                         CALLER
               Into the clubhouse turn, it's War
               Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud
               has moved up to second by a half,
               Lucky Lady is third by three
               followed by Jail Bait, Mojo,
               Bluenote and Wits' End.

     The heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused
     on the race.  Several of the patrons begin to yell for their
     horses.  Lonnegan remains seated.  He seems bored with it
     all.  Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his
     table.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (out of the corner of
                    his mouth)
               You really picked a winner, kid.

                         HOOKER
               Give 'em a little time.

                         CALLER
               Into the backstretch it's War Eagle
               still by a length, Dancing Cloud
               closing on the inside, is second by
               two, Lucky Lady is third by one and
               a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail
               Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

     Lonnegan perks up just a little.  Bluenote, at least, has
     moved up.  The rest of the people in the place are really
     rooting now.  Few of them remain seated.

     Hooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from
     Lonnegan's table.  Eirie is already there, fortifying
     himself with a scotch.

                         HOOKER
               You're doin' great, Eirie.  He
               loves ya.

     Eirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table.

                         CALLER
               Into the far turn, it's Dancing
               Cloud now by half a length, War
               Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is
               third by a half and moving fast on
               the outside.  Lucky Lady is fourth
               by four lengths, followed by Jail
               Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

     Lonnegan is getting more intent now.

                         CALLER
               Coming down the stretch, it's
               Dancing Cloud by one length, War
               Eagle and Bluenote are neck and
               neck by two.  Now it's Dancing
               Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle.
                    (shouting now)
               Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to
               head...

     The place is going crazy.  Even Singleton is standing up to
     get the necessary excitement in his voice.

                         CALLER
               Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  Dancing
               Cloud, Bluenote.  It's Bluenote by
               a nose.  Dancing Cloud is second by
               two, War Eagle third by three and a
               half.  Time for a mile and 1/8,
               2:01 and 6/10 seconds.

     Most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent
     lovers.  Eirie slams his racing form to the floor.  Nobody
     had Bluenote.

                         CURLY
                    (tearing up his ticket)
               Bloody awful.  Who in blazes is
               Bluenote?

                         LONNEGAN
                    (to Eirie, very self-satisfied)
               War Eagle's where you want to have
               your money, huh?

     Eirie doesn't reply.  He can't believe Bluenote won.
     Lonnegan looks to Hooker.  Hooker gives him a wink.  For
     the first time, Lonnegan permits a smile.

     LONNEGAN AT THE CASHIER'S WINDOW

     Niles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff
     won the night before).  Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed.
     Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him.

                         GONDORFF
                    (getting his name
                    right this time)
               Don't bother to come back with a
               piker's bet like that again,
               Lonnegan.  We got a $5,000 minimum
               here.
                    (to Hooker)
               Show this bum out.

     Hooker hesitates a second.

                         GONDORFF
               Go on, ya goddamn ninny.

     Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his
     foot, sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor.

                         GONDORFF
                    (indicating Lonnegan's
                    bodyguards)
               And tell him not to bring his
               garbage men in here no more.  This
               is a class joint.

     Hooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and
     escorts Lonnegan to the door.  Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff
     a derisive smile, and walks out.  Once he's gone, the
     general clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had
     been turned off by a faucet.  Most of the boost sit down and
     relax.  Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke.  It's been
     itching him.

                         GONDORFF
               He's gaffed, kid.  He should start
               coming to you now.

     INT. COMB'S OFFICE AT THE CLEARINGHOUSE - DAY

     Combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across
     the room every now and then at Riley, who is slumped uneasily
     in a folding chair, looking like a defendant at the
     Inquisition.  Both remain silent, like two men in a waiting
     room.  Suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives.
     Lonnegan comes into the office, flanked by his bodyguards.
     Skipping the usual pleasantries, he walks right over to Riley.

                         LONNEGAN
               All right, Riley.  What the hell
               happened?

                         RILEY
                    (not looking at him)
               We missed him.

                         LONNEGAN
               You weren't hired to miss him.

                         RILEY
               There wasn't any way he coulda
               known we was in there.  We made a
               clean pick on the lock and didn't
               leave no footprints in the hall.
               Somebody musta wised him up.

                         LONNEGAN
               Yeh, and what does Cole say about
               that?

                         RILEY
               I don't know.  He took it hard.

                         LONNEGAN
               All right, get outa here.  You're
               outta work.

     Riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped
     dog.

                         LONNEGAN
               We'll put Salino on it.  I need
               somebody careful.

                         COMBS
               Salino?  Why waste our best people
               on a small-time job like this?  It
               ain't no heavy gee we're after.
               The guy's a five and dime grifter.

                         LONNEGAN
               Then why ain't he dead?

                         COMBS
               They didn't think he'd be so cagey,
               that's all.  They'll get him next
               time.

                         LONNEGAN
               Use Salino.  It'll take a little
               longer, but there won't be any
               holes in it.

     Combs gives up.  The second time's the charm.

                         LONNEGAN
               And tell Cole I wanta see him when
               he gets in.

                         COMBS
               He's not comin' in.  Not to get
               bounced off a job anyway.

                         LONNEGAN
               He had his chance and all he did
               was shoot up a rooming house.  Made
               a lotte noise and woke up a few
               cops, but didn't hit nothin'.

     Combs keeps his mouth shut.  There's no way to talk to
     Lonnegan when  he's like this.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (cooling a little)
               This is Salino's job now, Vince.
               If Cole wants to muscle in on it,
               that's his business.  But he's
               breakin' the rules and when Salino
               finds out about it, I can't feel
               sorry for what's gonna happen to him.

     INT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

     The finest the period had to offer.  We pick up Hooker
     coming down the hall to Lonnegan's suite.  He is admitted by
     the Bodyguard.  Lonnegan, wearing a smoking jacket, is
     seated at a table counting a pile of money.  There are two
     other assistants standing behind him.  They don't look
     friendly.

                         HOOKER
               Well, what did I tell ya?

                         LONNEGAN
               You're a lucky man, all right.

                         HOOKER
               Lucky, hell.  I could do it every
               day.

                         LONNEGAN
               Why don't ya then.

                         HOOKER
               'Cause it's better to do it all at
               once.
                    (leaning close)
               We're puttin' down 400 grand next
               week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million.
               Twenty per cent of that is yours if
               ya stick with us.

                         LONNEGAN
               You got a system, Carver?
     


                         HOOKER
               You stayin' in or not?

                         LONNEGAN
               I'm in.

                         HOOKER
                    (drawing up a chair,
                    barely able to
                    contain his enthusiasm)
               It's foolproof.  We got a partner
               downtown runs the central office of
               the Western Union.  Race results
               from all over the country come in
               there and go right across his desk
               on their way to the bookies.  All
               he does in hold them up a couple
               minutes until he can call us and
               get a bet down on the winner.  Then
               he releases the results to the
               bookies and we clean up on a race
               that's already been run.  It can't
               miss, unless the Western Union
               Dicks get onto it.

     Lonnegan is amazed.  He sits back a second, then comes
     forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to Hooker.
     Hooker smiles and begins to count the money.

                         LONNEGAN
               You got the 400 grand yet?

                         HOOKER
               Not yet, but...
                    (stopping suddenly)
               Hey, there's only a grand here.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (more like a command)
               I think we oughta place another bet
               tomorrow.

                         HOOKER
                    (getting angry)
               What is this?  That's my money.
               You tryin' to muscle me?

                         LONNEGAN
                    (controlled)
               If your system's as foolproof as
               you say, you'll get even more.

     Hooker's in a jam and he knows it.

                         HOOKER
                    (after a pause)
               I gotta talk to me partner first.
               We can't afford to expose our game
               too much.

                         LONNEGAN
               Let me talk to him.

                         HOOKER
                    (flatly)
               No.

                         LONNEGAN
               You want your money back?  Try and
               get it in a court of law.
                    (softening a bit)
               C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll
               make it worth your while.  Migth
               even help ya finance the big play
               if this one works out.

     Hooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods
     his head.

                         HOOKER
               Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up
               at Dewey Lyle's.

     EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

     We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down
     the street.  As he does so, we pull back all the way across
     the street and through the interior of a parked car to
     reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel.  We move
     to his right hand, which rests on the steering column.  It's
     covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing.
     His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY

     One of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass
     panes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly.

                         HOOKER
               Twist?  I told him the tale.  He
               wants to see ya.

                         TWIST
               All right, when?

                         HOOKER
               Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside,
               I'll come in and get ya.  And be
               hard on him for a while; he's
               talking money.

                         TWIST
               Okay, Tootsie.

     Hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He
     turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something
     that stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the
     smirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized.

     Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out
     his gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then
     violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the
     door with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the
     booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek.

     Hooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand
     in the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints
     out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and
     gives pursuit.

     EXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN

     We follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race
     through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving
     through places that only get light at night.  The wind blows
     drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still
     has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death.

     CONDEMNED BUILDING

     Hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the
     stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes.

     INT. BUILDING

     On the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks
     the door.

     We pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the
     building is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps
     through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent
     building, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes
     off down the hall.  We cut back to

     Snyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally
     crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful
     panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville.

                                        CUT TO:

     LONG SHOT - HOOKER

     Winding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along
     backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making
     good his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a
     maze.

                         GONDORFF (V.O.)
               Why didn't you tell me about Snyder
               before?

                         HOOKER (V.O.)
               I thought I'd lost him.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

     Hooker sits sullenly at the table.  Billie stands over him
     putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts.
     Gondorff looks on.  Their discussion continues.

                         GONDORFF
               Well you found him again and we're
               gonna have to do somethin' about it.
               What else haven't ya been tellin' me?

                         HOOKER
               Nothin'.  I told ya everything
               there is.

                         GONDORFF
               Then why'd ya move outa your room?

                         HOOKER
               It was too noisy.

                         GONDORFF
               You can't play your friends like
               marks, Hooker.

     Hooker doesn't reply.  He knows Gondorff's on to him.

                         GONDORFF
               You know how easy it'd be for one
               of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?

                         HOOKER
               All we need is a couple days, Henry.
               A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan
               down and stomp on 'em.

                         GONDORFF
               You just won't learn, will ya.
               Hell, you come in here, I teach you
               stuff maybe five guys in this world
               know, stuff most grifters couldn't
               do even if they knew it, and all
               you wanna do is run down a bullet.
                    (pause)
               You're just like all them new jerks.
               Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten
               years from now when me and the
               others are through and you dumb
               guys are all dead there won't be
               one gee left who knows the Big Con
               was anything more than a way to
               make a livin'.

                         HOOKER
               A couple days; that's all I'm
               askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

                         GONDORFF
                    (trying to be angry
                    and failing)
               Christ, they'll probably miss you
               and hit me.

     INT. A SLEEPY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

     Located across the street from Hooker's apartment building.
     Hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and
     eggs he's hardly touched.

     The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding.
     A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically,
     it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or
     drive out the smell of onions and grease.

     A waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles
     slowly over to Hooker's table.  Slim and raven-haired, she
     manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering
     things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings.
     Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.
     


                         LORETTA
               You done?

                         HOOKER
               Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat
               loaf.

                         LORETTA
                    (deadpan)
               It isn't any better.

                         HOOKER
               Where's June today?

                         LORETTA
                    (figuring up the bill)
               She don't work here no more.  I'm
               fillin' in for a couple days...
               till I can get a train outa here.

                         HOOKER
               Where you goin'?

                         LORETTA
                    (putting the check
                    down and walking away)
               I don't know.  Depends what train I
               get on.

     Hooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on.  He
     doesn't get it.  He takes out some money, drops it on the
     table and walks out.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. A WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

     A truck with the words CLAYTON BROS., CUSTOM PAINTING AND
     DECORATING stenciled on the side, is parked out front.  Two
     men, wearing overalls and painter's caps, walk into the
     office to the reception counter, we see that they are Twist
     and Singleton.

                         TWIST
                    (to the receptionist)
               Excuse me.  We're here to paint Mr.
               Harmon's office.

                         RECEPTIONIST
                    (obviously not
                    expecting them)
               Mr. Harmon's office?  Hold on just
               a second.
     


She goes to get Mr. Harmon.

     EXT. THE SLEEZY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

     Hooker is standing on the curb outside the diner, obviously
     waiting for somebody.  Lonnegan's car pulls up and Hooker
     hops in the back.

                         LONNEGAN
               What happened to your face?

                         HOOKER
               Had a little fight with a raggle
               down on 13th.  She got me with her
               ring.

     Lonnegan laughs.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AGAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Mr. Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that
     Twist and Singleton have given him.  He can't find anything
     wrong with it.

                         HARMON
               Brigham signed it all right.  I
               can't understand why he didn't tell
               me.

                         SINGLETON
               Ah, he's like all them supervisors.
               They think they're too good for
               regular people.  He says he was in
               here a while ago and the place was
               a mess.

     Harmon looks around, hoping it's not true.

                         TWIST
               We'll try and hurry so we don't
               keep you out of your office too long.

                         HARMON
               Why can't I work with you in there?

                         SINGLETON
               Look pal, we gotta cover the floor,
               the furniture, everything, so we
               don't spill on nothing.  Now if you
               wanta sit in there with a tarp over
               your head, you're welcome to it.

                         HARMON
               All right, how long will you be?

                         TWIST
               Hour or two at the most.  We do
               good work.

     Harmon is resigned.  Twist and Singleton pick up their gear
     and march into the office.  Once inside, we notice that the
     office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley.
     Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit
     and tie he's wearing underneath.  He takes out a picture of
     himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on
     Harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's
     family.  Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and
     begins to paint the walls.

     Lonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street.

                         HOOKER
               We'll go to the side door.

     We follow Hooker and Lonnegan across the street to the side
     entrance which opens into:

     INT. HARMON'S OFFICE

     Hooker knocks and Twist, of course, answers.

                         HOOKER
               Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me.
               He wants to see you a second.

                         TWIST
                    (irritated)
               What the hell's the matter with you.
               We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

                         HOOKER
               I thought it might be good for him
               to see the setup.

                         TWIST
                    (hushed)
               Well we can't talk in here.  They're
               having the place painted.

     Twist walks over to the intercom on his desk.  He leaves the
     door open so that Lonnegan can get a good look at the
     office, Twist's picture in it, the painter, etc... Lonnegan's
     not missing any of it.

                         TWIST
                    (talking into the intercom)
               Miss Barnes, I'm going home a
               little early today.  Tell anyone
               that calls that they can reach me
               here in the morning.  Thank you.

     INT. FRONT OFFICE

     Harmon's secretary at the other end of the intercom.  Mr.
     Harmon is with her.  They look at each other a second and
     Harmon decides he better see what's happening in his office.
     He opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of
     painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. A DILAPIDATED CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

     Dark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy
     lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and
     arcade games that line the walls.  Hooker, Lonnegan and
     Twist sit at one of the more secluded tables.  They are not
     eating.

                         TWIST
               Can't do it.  There're telegraph
               inspectors all over the place.  I
               got 750 grand coming in from the
               coast, and I'm not gonna blow it
               for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get
               somebody else to do our betting.

                         LONNEGAN
               I could come up with 750 grand in a
               day if I had a reason to.

                         TWIST
               But who says you will.  I got a guy
               I can depend on.  He's liquidating
               everything he has for this.  You
               wouldn't even give Carver his money
               back.

                         LONNEGAN
               I need more proof, that's all.
               Anybody can get lucky once.

                         TWIST
                    (stubbornly)
               On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya.
               We'll keep the deal we got.

                         LONNEGAN
               If it works again tomorrow, I'll
               have a half million in cash here by
               noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

                         TWIST
                    (feebly, beginning to break)
               We were getting 50 from our guy.

                         LONNEGAN
               With 20% coming off the top for me
               laying your bet.  Either way you
               end up with 40.

     Twist hesitates.

                         LONNEGAN
               A week's a long time, friend.
               Anything can happen.  All of it bad.

                         HOOKER
               He's right, Les.

                         TWIST
               Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow
               and he doesn't come up with the
               money.  We risk our whole operation
               for nothing.  I'll say when we make
               our bets.

                         LONNEGAN
               Not if you want me to keep makin'
               'em for ya.
     


                         HOOKER
               And what do we know about your guy.
               He says a week, but who knows if
               it's a month?  Lonnegan here's a
               banker.  He can get that dough with
               no questions asked.

     Twist says nothing for a minute, then:

                         TWIST
               All right.  Be at the booth at 1:00.
               I'll give you all three places this
               time, Lonnegan.  That better be
               proof enough.

     Hooker and Lonnegan smile at each other like life-long
     friends.  They get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a
     coffee cup large in the foreground.  As they go out the
     door, a black-gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame
     and puts a nickel down next to the cup.

     INT. A DOWNTOWN DINETTE - MORNING

     Snyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee, puts down a
     dime for the lot and exits.  We follow him down the street:

     EXT. STREET

     To a corner newsstand, where he stops to buy a morning paper.
     As he peruses it, he's approached by two large, clean-cut
     men in white skimmers.

                         MAN
               Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

                         SNYDER
               I don't know, what's up?

                         MAN
               F.B.I... The Captain'd like a few
               words with ya.  Ya got a couple
               minutes?

                         SNYDER
                    (completely floored)
               Yeh, sure.

     The two men show him to a waiting car.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

     Snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room,
     surrounded by four or five Federal Agents.  Visible around
     the room are several folding cots and portable lockers.  The
     agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily.  They
     all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain
     Polk, who paces the room smoking.  There is something long-
     suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a
     service that thought white skimmers were classy.

                         SNYDER
               What is this?  I got work to do.

                         POLK
               Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try
               not to live up to all my
               expectations.
                    (not in the mood to
                    screw around)
               We were told you know a hustle
               artist named Johnny Hooker.

     Snyder doesn't answer.

                         POLK
               Do ya know him or don't ya?

                         SNYDER
               Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

                         POLK
               Well we do.  He's chummin' around
               with a Big C named Henry Gondorff.
               Ring any bells?

                         SNYDER
               Sure.  Every bunco man in the
               country knows Gondorff.

                         POLK
               There's word he's gonna run a con
               on the North Side here.  We got a
               year-old Florida warrant on him,
               but it's a thin beef, and he can
               beat it in court unless we catch
               him cold.  All we want you to do is
               pick up Hooker for us.

                         SNYDER
               Why don't you pick him up yourself?

                         POLK
               Cause the stoolies are used to
               street dicks jumpin' him.  If word
               gets around that Feds are in on it
               too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole
               thing.

                         SNYDER
               Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd
               hafta move outa this nice office ya
               got.

                         POLK
                    (enraged)
               Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot.
               I spent a lotta time in dumps like
               this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while
               the bunco squad gets rich tippin'
               him off.  But it's not gonna happen
               this time.  We're not even gonna
               let the police know we're here.  If
               you keep your mouth shut and do a
               job, there'll be a promotion in it
               for ya.  And you better take it,
               cause I can make ya work for us
               without it.

                         SNYDER
               What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

                         POLK
               He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

                         SNYDER
               He'll never do it.

                         POLK
                    (self-satisfied)
               I think he will.

     Specifically, the small room from which Singleton does his
     race broadcasts.  Singleton, himself, is hunched over the
     ticker machine, reading the print-out.  Billie sits at the
     microphone table with a pencil and pad, ready to write.

                         SINGLETON
               Visitation is still up by two at
               the three-quarters.  Single Action
               second, Fasanella third.

                         BILLIE

                         SINGLETON

                    on the print-out sheet)

                         BILLIE
               He'll probably fall down.

     Gondorff appears at the doorway.

                         GONDORFF
               How ya doin'?

                    the ticker)
               Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on
               the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

                         BILLIE
               Best we had was Cat's Eye in the
               second at Del Mar, and he was only
               5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in
               today.

                         SINGLETON
                    (excited)
               Billie.  You ready?

     Billie prepares to write on her pad.

                         BILLIE
               Yeh, go ahead.

                         SINGLETON
               At the finish, it's Single Action
               by two, Fasanella second, Visitation
               third.
                    (reading up the sheet again)
               Line on Single Action... 3 to 2.
               Hell with it, that's no good.

     Billie crumples up the piece of paper she's been writing on
     and chucks it in a wastecan.

                         GONDORFF
               We don't need big odds on this one,
               J.J.  Take anything you get at 3-1
               or better.

     Gondorff leaves the room, as Singleton turns back to his
     vigil at the ticker.

                         SINGLETON
                    (a little weary)

     Everyone is in his place as before.  Today, however, Curly
     Jackson is playing the part of the aging sport.

     Well scrubbed and clean shaven, he cuts a dashing figure in
     his blue blazer and white pants.  We go to Gondorff in the
     cashier's cage.  He's talking to Niles, who's busy handing
     out fake bankrolls to members of the boost.

                         GONDORFF
               He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand,
               Eddie.  How much cash we got?

                         NILES
               Not enough to cover a bet that big.

                         GONDORFF
               Get a couple extra guys in the

     Singleton and Billie at the ticker again.  Billie looks a

               Okay, Billie, here we go.

     Billie snaps to and prepares to write as Singleton reads.

               At the wire it's Wrecking Crew the

               Wingless third.

     Lonnegan's in line at the betting window.  There are four
     people in front of him this time, and they are moving rather
     slowly.  The "Last Flash" call is heard on the speakers.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (getting impatient)
               C'mon, let's hurry up there.

     The man at the head of the line turns around and gives
     Lonnegan a chilling look, as if he were beneath contempt.
     He puts down $25,000 on Grand Theft.  The next man in line
     plunges down $30,000 on Wrecking Crew.

     Just as Lonnegan is about to step to the window, Gondorff
     gives a quick signal to Singleton.  The speakers come on.

                         CALLER
               Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
               Arnold Rowe, your caller for the

               mile and 3/8 for three year olds

                    (counting out his money)
               Twenty-thousand on Wrecking Crew.

                         NILES
               I'm sorry, sir.  We can't take bets
               after the race is started.

     He points to a sign above the window, which says exactly
     that.  Lonnegan grabs up his money in disgust.

                         GONDORFF
               Don't take it so hard, pal.  You
               probably woulda lost it.

     Lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk.

                         CALLER
               And around the first turn it's
               Wrecking Crew by a half length,
               Grand Theft second by one, His
               Dandy is third by one half, followed
               by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made
               to Order and High Ground.

     The assembled patrons are once again thoroughly involved in
     the race.  Eirie comes up to Lonnegan at the bar.

               Me too.  Maybe it's our day.

     Lonnegan nods and wanders away.  Hooker comes over to him.

                         HOOKER
               What happened?

                         LONNEGAN

     Yeh, Lonnegan heard that.  Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his
     coat and heads for the door.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     He finds Hooker waiting for him outside.

               money here by post-time tomorrow.
               We'll take the first race where the

     Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and
     drives off.  Hooker relaxes into a smile.  He's already
     figured something out.

     Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf.
     Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter,
     looking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her
     every once in a while to see if she might be interested in
     striking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes
     his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill.

                         HOOKER
               Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of
               coffee.

                    (ringing it up)

     Hooker gives her a dollar.  She goes to the register for
     change.

                         HOOKER
               What time you get off work here?

               Yeh, sleepin'.

     Hooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change
     and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short.

     EXT. STREET

     Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man.
     It's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but
     Hooker isn't fooled.

     INT. DINER

     He goes back to Loretta at the register.

                         HOOKER
               You got a back door to this place?

                         LORETTA
               No.  What's wrong with the front?

                         HOOKER
                    (urgently now)
               Look, I don't have time to fuck
               around.  There's somebody out there
               I don't need to see.  You got a
               fire escape or anything?

                         LORETTA
               No.

                         HOOKER
               All right, do me a favor.  Go into
               the bathroom, open the window and
               wait for me there.

                         LORETTA
               What the hell for?

                         HOOKER
               Just do what I tell ya and
               everything'll be jake.

     Cracks of concern begin to appear in Loretta's marble.

                         LORETTA
               What does this guy want?

                         HOOKER
                    (evenly)
               He'd like to kill me.

     Loretta just looks at him a second.  Realizing that this is
     no joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the
     bathroom.  Hooker waits until she's out of sight.

     EXT. STREET

     Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside.  Cole looks
     up at the sound of the door.  Hooker makes a big show of
     spotting him, and runs back into the diner.  Cole, his cover
     blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit.
     Arriving just in time to see --

     INT. DINER

     Hooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only
     to find the place empty.  He goes quickly from stall to
     stall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of
     them.

     He comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's
     legs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next
     one.

     We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the
     toilet with her skirt hiked up.  Right behind her, crouched
     on the back of the seat, is Hooker.

     Cole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found
     nothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route.
     He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a
     small air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape.
     Hooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs
     back out through the diner.  Cole sees him, but too late to
     get off a shot.  He climbs back in the window and gives chase.

     EXT. STREET

     We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a
     hundred yards or so behind.  Hooker makes a sharp cut into
     an alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead
     end.  Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out.

     Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill
     which should be easy now.  He prepares to sight down his
     victim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in
     sight.  Hooker, miraculously, has vanished.  Cole scans the
     alley frantically for some trace of him.  There are no
     windows or doors at the street level.  Not even a drain pipe.
     Just brick wall.  It's impossible.  Hooker has disappeared
     into thin air.

     Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse,
     and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he
     stops in utter terror.  His mouth drops open and he chokes
     out the words:

                         COLE
               Salino, hey look.  I didn't mean to
               move in on...

     Before anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his
     chest.  He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a
     manhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar.  We:

                                        CUT TO:

     THE SEWER PIPES

     Beneath the manhole.  We see Hooker making his way through
     the slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that
     with two down, there is still one to go.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

     Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator,
     one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the
     inside.  He's still a little rattled and waiting for the
     elevator is making him restless.  It finally arrives, and he
     steps inside, closing the grid behind him.  As he starts to
     push the button for his floor, he realizes for the first
     time that he's not alone.  He looks to the corner to find
     Snyder, holding a gun on him.  This time there's not much
     doubt that he'll use it if necessary.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - EVENING

     Snyder brings Hooker into the crate room where Capt. Polk
     and the other Agents are waiting.  Polk, as usual, has his
     coat off, revealing his shoulder holster.

                         POLK
               Hello, Mr. Hooker.  Captain Polk,
               F.B.I...
                    (shoving a chair over
                    to him)
               Have a seat.

     Hooker remains standing.

                         POLK
                    (ignoring it, drinking
                    from a cup)
               You want a drink or something?

                         HOOKER
               No.

                         POLK
               We want to talk to ya about Henry
               Gondorff.

                         HOOKER
               Don't think I know him.

                         POLK
               Well give yourself a couple seconds,
               crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to
               me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done
               a lotta griftin' in this town.

                         HOOKER
               Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

     Capt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it.

                         HOOKER
               You got nothin' on me.

                         POLK
               We'll get it, and if we can't,
               we'll just make it up.  Grand
               larceny, extortion.
                    (with special emphasis)
               Counterfeiting, anything you want.

     Hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's
     beginning to get the picture.

                         POLK
               Look, I got nothin' against you,
               but you're in trouble here.  All
               you gotta do is tell us when
               Gondorff's gonna play his chump.
               We come in at the sting, make the
               pinch, and you walk out free as a
               bird.  No questions, no court
               appearance, nothing.

                         HOOKER
               No.
     


                         POLK
               You've already done time twice, and
               judges don't like three time losers.
               You wanna sit in the can for forty
               years, startin' tonight?

                         HOOKER
               I'll make parole.

                         POLK
               Like hell.  You won't even get a
               review till you're seventy.  And if
               the board starts to go soft, we'll
               let ya out in the yard some night
               with a hard-nose young bull who'll
               put fifty slugs in your face and
               ask what you were doin' there later.

     Hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it.

                         POLK
               Don't be a sap, kid.  You could
               save us a little trouble.  But
               Henry Gondorff is through whether
               you help us or not.  There's
               nothin' left to do now but save
               yourself.

     Hooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time.

                         HOOKER
                    (softly)
               Will you wait until the chump is
               played?

                         POLK
               Hell yes.  We don't care about the
               mark.  He deserves what he gets.

                         HOOKER
                    (with heat)
               I mean completely played.  Until
               he's beat and the score is taken.
               You come in before we beat him and
               I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough
               time explaining that, won't ya.

                         POLK
               All right, Hooker, but you take it
               on the lam, and we'll shoot you
               down on sight.

                         HOOKER
                    (barely audible)
               Just as long as I get to finish the
               play.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking.
     Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is
     quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a
     heavy silence hangs over the place.

                         GONDORFF
               What's the matter, kid?  You're not
               sayin' much.

                         HOOKER
               Just a little nervous, that's all.

                         GONDORFF
               Luther always told me to bite my
               toenails when I get nervous.  You
               see yourself doin' that and you
               realize it ain't worth it.

     Hooker smiles feebly.

     Billie appears at the door.

                         BILLIE
               Things are a little slow tonight,
               Henry.  I wanna open the round for
               the girls.

     Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her.
     She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles
     back into the game.

                         GONDORFF
               Take it easy, you won't lose him
               now.  We had him 10 years ago when
               he decided to be somebody.  Believe
               me, I've seen enough to know.

                         HOOKER
                    (softly)
               How many guys you conned in your
               life, Henry?

                         GONDORFF
               Two or three hundred I guess.
               Sometimes played two a day when I
               was in Shea's mob.  We had it down
               to a business.
                    (pause)
               'Course Chicago was a right town
               then.  The fix was in.  The dicks
               took their end without a beef.  All
               the Wall Street boys wanted to make
               investments for us.  Even had marks
               looking us up, thinkin' they could
               beat the game.
                    (pause)
               Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No
               sense in bein' a grifter if it's
               the same as bein' a citizen.

     Gondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for
     the night.

                         GONDORFF
               I better do some packin'.  I'm
               gonna be a hot number again after
               tomorrow.

                         HOOKER
               Then why you doin' it?

                         GONDORFF
               Seems worthwhile, doesn't it?
               Maybe it's just for the cave-in on
               Lonnegan's face when we put in the
               sting.

     That's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave.

                         HOOKER
               Henry.

                         HOOKER
               Yeh.

                         HOOKER
                    (apologetically)
               I appreciate your stickin' your
               neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya
               if it weren't for Luther.

                         GONDORFF
               Ain't nothin' gonna make up for
               Luther, kid.
                    (pause)
               Revenge is for suckers.  I been
               griftin' 30 years and never got any.

     Hooker just nods and walks out the door.

     INT. CAROUSEL

     We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling
     prostitutes in various stages of undress.  Their childish
     frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but
     it's lost on Hooker tonight.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT

     It's late now and the street is deserted save for an
     occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a
     night's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street
     toward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost
     reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there
     or not.

     As he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of
     the diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she
     looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that
     advertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a
     light come on in one of its second story windows.

     Hooker just stands there a second, debating with himself,
     trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to
     do anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's
     building and:

     INT. LORRETA'S

     He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on.
     He passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice
     and Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a
     little startled to see him.

                         LORETTA
               Looks like he missed ya.

                         HOOKER
               Yeh, this time anyway.

     Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her
     room across the hall.

                         LORETTA
               Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

     Mrs. Hillard quickly closes her door.

                         HOOKER
                    (shuffling a little)
               I, ah...thought you might wanna
               come out for a while.  Maybe have a
               drink or somethin'.

                         LORETTA
               You move right along, don't ya.

                         HOOKER
                    (with more innocence
                    than confidence)
               I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just
               don't know many regular girls,
               that's all.

                         LORETTA
               And you expect me to come over,
               just like that.

                         HOOKER
               If I expected somethin', I wouldn't
               be still standin' out here in the
               hall.

     Loretta looks at him carefully.  She knows it's not a line.

                         LORETTA
                    (with less resistance now)
               I don't even know you.

                         HOOKER
                    (slowly)
               You know me.  I'm just like you...
               It's two in the morning and I don't
               know nobody.

     The two just stand there in silence a second.  There's
     nothing more to say.  She stands back and lets him in.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

     A record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear
     Robert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen." Gondorff is
     sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie
     is curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase
     next to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second.
     


                         BILLIE
               C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've
               done everything you can.

     Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on
     thinking.

                                        CUT TO:

     LORRETA'S ROOM

     Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their
     bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a
     neon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and
     move in on another window in the building next door.  There's
     no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a
     face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to
     afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand.

                    "I said come on in my kitchen
               Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors."

     Music ends.

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     THE STING

                                        FADE OUT.

     FADE IN:

     We open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on
     his face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a
     second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to
     find that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets
     out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
     evidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty
     closet, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he
     suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his
     wallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he
     slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will
     happen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we:

     INT. AN UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

     We see the black-gloved hand opening a small wooden box.
     Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in
     two pieces.  The hand reaches in and takes them out.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE SLEEZY DINER - DAY

     Hooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage.  The
     waitress on duty is not Loretta and Hooker has noticed.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

     Gondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror,
     putting on his tuxedo.  He goes to his dresser, pulls out a
     very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

     The hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the
     revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber.  He then
     screws the barrel onto the body.  This is all seen in closeup.

                                        CUT TO:

     HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

     Hooker now has his tuxedo on.  He takes two small rubber
     bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. LONNEGAN'S SUITE - DAY

     Lonnegan paces nervously around the room, looking at the
     clock.  Obviously waiting for something, he's getting
     extremely impatient.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

     We watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber
     of the revolver.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

     Gondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase.  He
     stops and looks up at the mezzanine where Billie is standing.
     They smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave,
     having done this too many times to get sentimental about it
     now.  Gondorff walks out of the building.

                                        CUT TO:

     HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

     Hooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper
     bag, lumping clothes with food, records and toilet articles.

                                        CUT TO:

     LONNEGAN'S SUITE AGAIN

     Lonnegan goes to the door to admit Floyd and two assistants,
     one of whom carries a large brief case.  Lonnegan takes the
     brief case to a table and opens it.  Inside is a half
     million dollars in cash.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

     We see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver.  The
     gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment
     and for the first time we see the face that goes with the
     hand.  It is fully as menacing as we had imagined: Broad,
     flat nose, thick cracked lips, narrow eyes and cauliflower
     ears.

                                        CUT TO:

     HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

     Hooker is on the phone now.

     INT. WAREHOUSE

     We see that he's talking to Captain Polk.  Snyder listens
     also.

     HOOKER'S ROOM

     Hooker finishes the conversation, hangs up and goes to take
     one last look at himself in the mirror.  Finding everything
     in order, he grabs up his sack of possessions and leaves the
     room.

     EXT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

     We pick him up emerging from the building, and follow him
     around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally
     takes on his way to the store.  As he walks along, he
     notices Loretta coming toward him from the other end.  She's
     wearing a coat, obviously on her way somewhere.  As she
     comes closer, we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly
     in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker.

     EXT. ALLEYWAY

     The gunman quickly takes out his revolver, braces it in the
     crook of his hand, and takes careful aim.  Loretta sees him.
     The gunman fires.  Loretta falls dead on the asphalt.

     Hooker spins around in confusion.  The gunman moves quickly
     toward him.  Hooker starts to back up but the gunman stops
     when he gets to Loretta.  He kicks her over to reveal a gun
     under her body.

                         GUNMAN
               She was gonna kill ya, kid.

     Hooker is stunned.  He can't believe it.

                         GUNMAN
                    (dragging the body
                    over behind a trash can)
               Her name's Loretta Salino.
               Lonnegan's people set her up in the
               diner.  C'mon, let's get outa here.

     Hooker wants to stay and try to figure it all out, but the
     gunman drags him away.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

     Polk, Snyder and several federal agents are busy putting on
     their shoulder holsters, and checking their weapons.

                         POLK
                    (to Snyder)
               Whoever Gondorff's playin' for is
               bound to be a wheel.  As soon as
               we're inside, I want you to get the
               guy outa there as fast as possible,
               before the reporters show up.  We
               can't afford to embarrass any big
               shots.

     Snyder nods.

                                        CUT TO:

     EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

     Lonnegan, carrying the brief case personally, is seen
     getting into his limousine.  Four assistants get in with him.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. THE STORE - DAY

     Gondorff enters the store carrying his suitcase.  Several of
     the boost are already there.  Gondorff clasps his hands to
     generate a little enthusiasm.  He's obviously up for this one.

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. TAXI CAB - DAY

     Hooker sits in the back seat with the gunman right next to
     him.  He's still very uneasy with this man.

                         HOOKER
               She coulda killed me last night.

                         GUNMAN
               Too many people coulda seen ya go
               in her room.  She was a professional.
               Used to work in the Dutch Schultz
               gang.

                         HOOKER
               Who are you?

                         GUNMAN
               Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

                         HOOKER
               How do I know you're tellin' the
               truth.

                         GUNMAN
               Don't have much choice, do ya?

     We go to Hooker.  No, he doesn't.

     EXT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

     We pick up Polk, Snyder and the other federal agents coming
     out of the warehouse in their white skimmers, and piling
     into cars.

     THE STORE AGAIN

     Niles is busily spreading "boodles" all over the cashier's
     area.  Singleton checks his microphone.  It works fine.  He
     checks it again.

     LONNEGAN IN HIS LIMOUSINE

     He holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping
     lightly on it.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE STORE AGAIN

     Hooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who
     breaks into a wide smile.  Hooker returns it halfheartedly,
     still ill at ease about what has happened.

                                        CUT TO:

     THE F.B.I. CARS ON THEIR WAY

     There are four or five driving in a column.  Snyder and Polk

     EXT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

     Lonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards
     pile out.

     THE STORE AGAIN

     Gondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension
     expressed in their faces.

     INT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

     Lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth.  He keeps both
     hands firmly planted on the brief case.  The phone rings and
     Lonnegan goes to it.  Music ends.

                         VOICE
               Place it on Syphon at 8-1.

     Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer.
     Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for.

     EXT. STREET

     We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store.
     The bodyguards remain outside.
     


INT. THE STORE

     The store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are
     everywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
     keep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the
     betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one
     man ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

     Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and
     opens it for Niles to see.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (straight-faced)
               Five hundred grand on Syphon.

     Niles is struck dumb.  He's never seen that much money before.

                         NILES
                    (playing the flustered
                    clerk)
               Hold on, I'll have to get the
               manager.

     Niles goes and returns with Gondorff.

                         GONDORFF
               What's the problem?

                         NILES
                    (pointing to the
                    brief case)
               He wants to put a half million on
               Syphon.

     Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
     Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.

                         GONDORFF
                    (uneasily)
               I can't lay that off in time.  We
               lose a bet that big, it could break
               us.

                         LONNEGAN
                    (challenging)
               If ya win it could make ya, too.

                         GONDORFF
                    (to Niles)
               What are the odds on Syphon?

                         NILES
               Eight to one.

     Gondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard.

                         GONDORFF
               A half mill on an eight to one shot.
               You're dumber than I thought,
               Lonnegan.

                         LONNEGAN
               You're more gutless than I thought.

     The words "Last Flash" are heard on the speaker.  Gondorff
     looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt.  He turns to Niles.

                         GONDORFF
                    (chopped)
               Take it.

     Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars.
     Lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and
     retires to a nearby table.  He flashes a little okay sign to
     Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod.

                         CALLER
               Ladies and gentlemen, this is
               Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
               San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in
               Baltimore -- A mile and 1/16 for
               three-year-olds.  And they're off.

     Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair,
     the larceny boiling in his veins.  Hooker looks to Gondorff.
     Gondorff gives him the "office." Hooker has to smile.

                         CALLER
               And around the first turn it's
               King's Image by a neck, Syphon is
               second by one, Key to the Vault
               third by one half, followed by Mr.
               Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and
               No Charge.

     Unexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance.
     Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to
     Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him.

                         TWIST
               Sorry, but I just couldn't wait.
               Did everything go all right?
     


                         LONNEGAN
                    (motioning for him to
                    keep his voice down)
               Take it easy.  Everything's all
               right.  I put it on Syphon, on the
               nose.

                         TWIST
                    (in utter horror)
               On the nose!  I said place.  Place
               it on Syphon.  That horse is going
               to run second.

     Lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed.  He vaults over
     the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles.

                         LONNEGAN
               You give me my goddamn money back!
               You hear me?  There's been a mistake!

                         NILES
               I'm sorry, sir.  The betting's
               closed.

     Lonnegan begins to shake him violently.

                         LONNEGAN
               You give me my money back.  There's
               been a mistake, do you hear me?

     Gondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash
     at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal
     agents burst into the room, guns drawn.  The place falls
     silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost
     afraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other
     wondering how this could have possibly happened.

                         POLK
                    (motioning to Hooker)
               All right, Hooker, you can go.

     Hooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter
     disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker,
     unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk
     out.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at
     Gondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his
     back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from
     his mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into
     Gondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose.
     The members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is
     totally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's
     involved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him.

                         SNYDER
               C'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.

     EXT. STREET

     Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
     where an F.B.I. car is waiting.  His bodyguards have long
     since fled at the sight of the F.B.I. men.

                         LONNEGAN
               My money's back there.

                         SNYDER
               We'll worry about that later.

     Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away.

                                        CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE STORE AGAIN

     The pandemonium has now ceased.  Those who could escape
     have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking
     position.  Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead.  The
     loudspeaker drones on.  Singleton is still calling the race
     from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened.

                         CALLER
               And the winner is King's Image by
               four lengths, Syphon is second, by
               two, Moneyman third by two and one
               half.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles,
               1:21 and 2/10 seconds.

     Polk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down.

                         POLK
               He's gone.

     Hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the
     floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with
     blood, that he's had in his mouth.  Gondorff does likewise.
     Niles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to
     laugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents.

                         GONDORFF
                    (to Polk)
               Nice con, Hickey.  I thought you
               were Feds myself, when you first
               came in.

                         HICKEY
               No problem, Henry.  Snyder went for
               it all the way.
                    (laughing)
               You shoulda seen the rag he lit
               under Lonnegan.

     Gondorff turns to the others.

                         GONDORFF
               Okay, let's take this place apart
               and get outa here.  You can get
               your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's
               tonight.

     Gondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off
     his face and hands.

                         GONDORFF
               You beat him, kid.

                         HOOKER
                    (softly)
               You were right, Henry.  It's not
               enough... But it's close.

                         GONDORFF
               You wanta wait for your share?

                         HOOKER
               Naw, I'd just blow it.

     Gondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar.  He comes
     out with his suitcase in one hand and Hooker's paper bag in
     another.  He throws the paper bag to Hooker, who stops by
     the door.  Eirie Kid is standing there.  Hooker gives the
     "office" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back.

     EXT. ALLEY AND STREET

     Then Hooker and Gondorff leave.  We hold on them, two
     ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and
     disappear around the corner.

                                        FADE OUT.

                         THE END
