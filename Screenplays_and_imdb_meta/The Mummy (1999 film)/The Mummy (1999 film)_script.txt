The Mummy


The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on the African
continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT rises up. WE PUSH IN on
it, towards a CITY along the Nile, it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP
PUSHING IN until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves
DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not ancient.
SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

                         TREBES - 2,134 B.C

Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

                              NARRATOR

               Thebes. City of the Living. Crown
               jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn CHARIOT comes
barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI; an aristocratic, virile old
man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome, muscular MAN
with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

                              NARRATOR

               Home of Imhotep, High Priest of
               Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It takes us a
moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's wearing isn't a dress at
all, but rather her entire naked body has been PAINTED in the ancient
Egyptian manner She's a stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

                              NARRATOR

               Birthplace of Anck-su-namun.
               Pharaoh's Mistress. No other man was allowed
               to touch her.

She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA comes to a stop
on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's
really a strange looking TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald
MEN stand nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their
eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains. Anck-su-namun
embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately, feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam
over her perfect body, smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with
lust:

                              NARRATOR

               But for our love, we were willing to
               risk life itself.

And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself

on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush over and close the
doors. But just as they do, the doors suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily
strides in, looks at the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN, --SUBTITLED.)

                              PHARAOH

               What are you doing here?

The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival was
unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws them back.
Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh sees the
smeared body paint. Points his finger.

                              PHARAOH

               WHO HAS TOUCHED YOU?!

From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard. Pharaoh spins
around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

                              PHARAOH

               Imhotep? .... My priest.

Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back.
Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous bald Priests
SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the curtains, they see the
SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the
doors are RAMMED from the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun
turn and look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers share
desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and grab Imhotep and try
and pull him towards the balcony.

                              PRIESTS

               Pharaoh's bodyguards!

Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's sword out of
his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

                              ANCK-SU-NAMM

               You must go. Save yourself.
               Only you can resurrect me.

Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN. MEN with
BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over their bodies stride in,
armed to the teeth. These are the MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out
onto the dark balcony just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.
Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses--

                              ANCK-SU-NAMUN

               My body is no longer his temple!

She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. out on the balcony, Imhotep's
mouth opens into a horrible silent scream .........

                              NARRATOR/IMHOTEP

               For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's body
               was to be cursed. And it was I, the High
               Priest, whose duty it was to curse it.

EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-su-namun's
mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They pet her down in the sand along with
FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

                              IMHOTEP

               Her body was mummified, her vital
               organs removed and placed in sacred canopic
               jars

Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of pure GOLD. THIS
IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

                              IMHOTEP

               The Book of The Living contained
               sacred incantations that would send the evil
               dead on a journey into the dark underworld.

Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across Anck-su-namun's body and across the
faces of the slaves and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS Suddenly, everyone's
fear-filled eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising. Then
one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and it's over.
Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the ground.

Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus. The Nubian
slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand Imhotep then signals to
the Soldiers, who throw their spears at the Nubians. Killing them.

                              INHOTEP

               The slaves were killed....

Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed Soldiers, hacking
at them in the flickering darkness as Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly
watches.

                              IMHOTEP

               .... and the soldiers who killed them
               were also slain, so that no unholy person
               should ever know the exact location of the
               burial site.

The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one,
the Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the
vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant
dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's
grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the way. A
"hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP.
The chariots race across the map.

                              IMHOTEP

               But there was another book, The Book
               Of The Dead, which was never to-be opened,
               never to be read, for it contained the
               incantations that could bring a dead body
               back to life a most unholy thing.

The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. They race up
the stone ramp and in through the city gates. SUPERIMPOSED across the
SCREEN are the WORDS:

                    KANUNAPTM - City of the Dead

                              IMHOTEP

               It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
               the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, so
               that no such sacrilege might ever disgrace
               Egypt.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT inside the giant
STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD,
made of black stone.

                              IMHOTEP

               But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
               was willing to defy the gods.

INT- UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of
this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY. A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the
cemetery, --muck made out of filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in
the goop. The Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless
eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and forth as they
CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures. In the middle of the circle is
a strange, twisted ALTAR.' Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous,
lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

                              IMHOTEP

               Anck-su-namun's vital organs were
               still fresh, so a human sacrifice would not
               need be made

As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large SWIRLING HOLE
starts to open in the detritus bog. Several Priests look over at it,
frightened, then quickly look back down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST
wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through
them and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the heart
inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST,
BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are reaching a crescendo.
Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

                              IMHOTEP

               Anck-su-namun soul had come back from
               the dead! Now all that was needed, was to
               return her organs to their rightful place
               within her body.

Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's breast, about to
plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's
when the Mumia BURST IN and storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD
MUMIA SMASHES the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks back
out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the swirling hole.
Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS in rage. The
Mumia grab him and his Priests.

                              IMHOTEP

               My Priests were condemned to be
               mummified alive.

INT. EMBALMF.RIS CHAMBER (necropolis re-vamp) - NIGHT

Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed EMBALMERS. He
cringes at the flickering, impressionistic glimpses of his Priests being
embalmed and mummified alive. The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives,
needles and thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING
Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His eyes widen in
terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose. But
just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, horrified, as OFF
CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests squirm
inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees. His arms are held
back. His mouth is pried open.

                              IMHOTEP

               As for me, I was condemned to endure
               the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient curses.
               one so horrible, it had never before been
               bestowed.

Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's TONGUE out of his
mouth, then places a very sharp knife on top of it. WE-GO TIGHT on
IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings
Imhotep's tongue onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat
it.

Imhotep is WRAPPED AL M . Only his mouth, nostrils and fear-filled eyes are
left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus muck boils inside a black
cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's
wrappings as he squirms. He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone
SARCOPHAGUS. An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.
Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the bucket over
Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting dung beetles. They scurry
across Imhotep's SCREAMING face. Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth
and up his nostrils.

                              INHOTEP

               By eating the sacred scarabs, I would
               be cursed to stay alive forever. And by
               eating me, they were cursed just the same.

The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange four-sided
YCEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight. The heavy sarcophagus lid
is shoved into place and with a loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. once
again, the Head Mumia uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid
tight.

                              IMHOTEP

               I was to remain sealed inside my
               sarcophagus, the undead for all of eternity.

The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of
the key, --turning it into a little puzzle BOX.

                              INHOTEP

               They would never allow me to be
               released. For I would arise a walking
               disease, a plague upon mankind, an unholy
               flesh-eater, with the strength of ages, power
               over the sands, and the glory of
               invincibility.

Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The disgusting muck
SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and then is mysteriously sucked into
It's seams, vanishing clean.

                              INHOTEP

               And if I could raise my beloved
               Anck-su-namun from her place in hell,
               together, we would be an unstoppable
               infection upon this world. The Apocalypse.
               The End

Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREANS can be heard coming from inside
his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM: THE MUMMY

The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave. Looking down on
the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS, the jackal-headed god of
death. it stares at us. Then begins to DECAY before bur very eyes, aging
4.159 years in only seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit,
half-buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG HORSEMAN.
Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren. Armed
to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS: TEE SARKRA -
1925

A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRES
scurry through the ruins, preparing for the onslaught. OUR HERO is up on
the wall. His Kepi sits at a jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is
RICK O'CONNELL. He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at
him.

                              O'CONNELL

               I knew this was gonna be a lousy day.

A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of
the wall. This is BENI.

                              BENI

               Personally, I would like to surrender.
               Why can we not just surrender?

                              O'CONNELL

               Shut-up and gimme your bandolier,

Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

                              BENI

               Then let's run away. Right now. while we
               can still make it.

O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

                              O'CONNELL

               Now gimme your revolver, you'll
               never use it anyway.

Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell

                              BENI

               Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody ever
               does that anymore

O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

                              O'CONNELL

               Now go find me a big stick.

                              BENI

               in the desert? What for?

O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

                              O'CONNELL

               So I can tie it to your back, you
               appear to be without a spine

The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out. Scimitars
RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

                              O'CONNELL

               How'd a guy like you end up in the
               Legion anyways?

                              BENI

               I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots
               of good stuff in them holy places; churches,
               temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?

                              O'CONNELL

               Altar boys?

                              BENI

               Exactly! I speak seven languages,
               including Hebrew, so my specialty was
               synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?

Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground. O'Connell
gives him a nasty look.

                              O'CONNELL

               No, but I'm considering it.

They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

                              BENI

               What then? Robbery? Extortion?
               Kidnapping!

                              O'CONNELL

               None of the above, thank you

                              BENI

               Then what the hell are you
               doing here!?

They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of
warriors.-The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening. O'Connell gives Beni a
big cheesy smile.

                              O'CONNELL

               I was just looking for a good time.

And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly panics, cuts and
runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

                              O'CONNELL

               Oh shit Steady!

Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde Hoofs pounding
the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

                              O'CONNELL

               STEADY!

                    (to himself)

               What the hell am I sayin'?

The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog SCREAMS. More
Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

                              O'CONNELL

               STEADY!!

                    (to himself)

               What the hell am I doin'?

The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels himself, cocks
and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps, he spits it into the
sand. Another BEAT. And then--

                              O'CONNELL

               FIRE!

The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with a CRASH. The
BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their mounts. The prone
Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

                              O'CONNELL

               FIRE!

The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand. The remaining
warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the hot air. A third of the
Legionnaires are killed instantly.

                              O'CONNELL

               FIRE!

The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off their mounts.
Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg force plows into the ruins
and through the Legionnaires. O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and
starts CLUBBING riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, whimpering in
full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all around him. He crawls through
the front gate.

O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He cross-draws, gun
in each hand, starts blowing riders off their mounts.

Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY amongst the
rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the Legionnaires
are shot off their feet behind him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

                              O'CONNELL

               Son-of-a-bitch.

He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate. Four Tuareg
warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him. O'Connell hurdles a stone
column, hits the ground running. He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway,
trying to close the heavy sandstone door.

                              O'CONNELL

               Hey! Beni! Wait up!

Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

                              O'CONNELL

               What are ya doing?! Wait up!

O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen LEAP the big
column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

                              O'CONNELL

               Don't you close that door!

               DON'T YOU CLOSE TRAT DOOR!

Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell SLAMS his body
into the door. It doesn't budge

                              O'CONNELL

               I'm gonna get you for this!

He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his life, weaving
through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer and closer. The POUNDING
hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER. O'Connell finally spins around and faces
his attackers. The four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him.
The vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off. O'Connell just
stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them REAR UP. Two of
the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The horses SCREECH and BELLOW and
SNORT in fear, then buck like fury and haul-ass away as if the devil
himself had scared them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their
mounts.

O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right hand and
checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the evil himself, and turns
around. --The shattered, decrepit statue of Anubis stares back at him.

Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet. He starts to
back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming sand, it looks like huge
snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it, forming lines and shapes,
--drawing a picture. O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the
ruins. The sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the sand,
is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

EXT. RIDGE - DAY

Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble clear of the
decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence and looks up. Very different
from the Tuaregs, they have BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange
PUZZLE-TATTOOS. The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this
time.

The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with dual scimitars
across his waist. His face is both handsome and horrible, blue and
tattooed. Meet ARDETH BAY. His dark eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into
the open desert ........

EXT. CAIRO - DAY

Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions in the
sky since it's birth. A city teeming with every form of life. A strange,
mysterious, wonderful city. WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:
CAIRO

INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon rows of towering
bookshelves. Filled with literature on the Antiquities. Standing at the top
of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the
bookshelves,  is a  rather uninteresting British  GIRL: eye-glasses,
hair-in-a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare. This is
EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with her.

Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows the dust off it,
then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with the
letter "O". Then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads
the title.

                              EVELYN

               Tuthmosis? .... Now how did you get up here?

Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her shoulder to
the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles begin with the letter 'TO.
Then she looks down. It's a long way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the
other books down on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach
across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too far, so she
stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder with
her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn YELPS, flings
the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder, which stands straight
up. Evelyn holds her breath, swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then
she loses her balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts
stiltwalking down the aisle.

                              EVELYN

               OHEIUGM! ! AHHHHHH!

The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads back the way it
came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling for balance. The ladder teeters
out into the main aisle and picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a
180, spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a
bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES into the next
bookshelf. Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She looks
up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf crashing into the
next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after bookshelf. Thousands of volumes
flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor. It finally ends as
the last shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She opens one
eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other eye and stares at the
huge mess.

                              EVELYN

               Oops.

The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

                              CURATOR

               Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! Give
               me frogs, flies, locusts, Anything but this!
               Compared to you, the other plagues were a joy!

Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

                              EVELYN

               I'm sorry, it was an accident.

                              CURATOR

               When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an
               accident. You are a catastrophe!  Why do I
               put up with you?

Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

                              EVELYN

               You put up with me, because I can read and
               write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs
               and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a
               thousand miles who knows how to properly code
               and catalogue this library.

                              CURATOR

               Who needs smart women? I put up with you because
               your mother and father were our finest patrons,
               Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this
               mess!

The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming. And then she
hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

                              EVELYN

               Hello?

Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly shuffling
across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

                              EVELYN

               Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters--

INT. THE RAMESSEUM

Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. it's very dark
and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from FLICKERING TORCHES at either end
of the spooky gallery.

The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly shuffling,
plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch. Looks around,-at a statue
of Anubis, another of Horus, they stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to
get scared now. She walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past
cases of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, --only this one is
OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks around to see who
could have opened it. Then she slowly leans forward with the torch, and
peers inside.

--A  hideous rotted MUMMY  sits up  and SCREECHES at  her! Evelyn
SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out of her wits. And then,
coming from inside the sarcophagus, she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes
narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass
off, half drunk.

                              EVELYN

               You... ! YOU... !

                              JONATHAN

               Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call
               me something original.

Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, Evelyn pulls
a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

                              EVELYN

               Have you no respect for the dead?

                              JONATHAN

               Right now, I only wish to join them.

He grins drunkenly.  Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

                              EVELYN

               Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than
               later, before you ruin my
               career the way you've ruined yours.

                              JONATHAN

               My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you
               know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.

He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

                              EVELYN

               High note? Ha! For five years you've been
               scrounging around Egypt, and what have you
               to show for it? Nothing.

Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

                              JONATHAN

               oh yes I do! I have something right here!

                              EVELYN

               Oh no, not another worthless trinket,
               Jonathan, if I bring one more
               piece of junk to the Curator to try
               and sell for you.

Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY to Imhotep's
sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly curious, she grabs the box out
of his hand.

                              EVELYN

               Where did you get this?

Jonathan  knows  her weaknesses,  gives  her  a mischievous  smile.

                              JONATHAN

               On a dig, down in Thebes

Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself as she
translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it. Jonathan licks his
lips in anticipation.

                              JONATHAN

               My whole life I've never found
               anything, Evy Tell me I've
               found something.

Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the box, shifting
them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle box. Then suddenly, it
UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, turning itself into the KEY. Sitting
inside the open key/box is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT
MAP.

                              EVELYN

               Jonathan?

                              JONATHAN

               Yes?

                              EVELYN

               I think you found something.

INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's eyepiece at the key/box.  Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

                              EVELYN

               See the cartouche there, it's the official
               royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it

                              CURATOR

               Perhaps

Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

                              JONATHAN

               Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First?
               And was he rich?

                              EVELYN

               He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom,
               said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.

                              JONATHAN

               Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow,
               like him very much.

The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same map that we
established in the opening scenes of the movie.

                              EVELYN

               I've already dated it, this map
               is almost four thousand years old.

               And the hieratics over here....

               (Inhales deeply)

               It's Hamunaptra.

The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers

                              CURATOR

               My dear girl, don't be ridiculous,
               we are scholars, not treasure
               hunters. Hamunaptra is a myth.

                              JONATHAN

               Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

                              EVELYN

               Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early
               Pharaohs were said to have
               hidden the wealth of Egypt.

                              JONATHAN

               Right, right, in a big underground treasure
               chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire
               necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On
               Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the
               whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.

                              EVELYN

               All we know is that the city mysteriously
               vanished around 2,134 B.C.

The Curator holds the  map  closer to  the burning  CANDLE-LAMP.

                              CURATOR

               As the Americans would say: it's all fairy
               tales and hokum.

The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws it to the
floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out. Lifts it up.
The left third of the map is now missing.

                              JONATHM

               You burned it! You burned off the part with the lost city!

                              CURATOR

               It's for the best, I'm sure. Many men have
               wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of
               Hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have
               never returned.

                              JONATHAN (devastated)

                         You killed my map.

                              CURATOR

               I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm
               surprised at you, Miss
               Carnarvon, to be so fooled.

The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches it off the
desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every low-life form of
scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a first rate scumbag himself,
escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers
to Jonathan.

                              EVELYN

               You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!

                              JONATHAN

               I was mistaken.

                              EVELYN

               lied to me!

                              JONATHM

               I lie to everybody, what makes you so special?

                              EVELYN

               I'm your sister.

                              JONATHAN

               That just makes you more gullible.

                              EVELYN

               You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!

                              JONATHAN

               Picked his pocket, actually

EXT. VISITORIS PEN - DAY

The  Warden  ushers  Evelyn and  Jonathan  into  the holding  pen.

                              EVELYN

               and what is he in prison for?

                              WARDEN

               I did not know, so when I heard you were coming,
               I asked him that myself.

                              EVELYN

               And what did he say?

                              WARDEN

               He said,....he was just looking for a good time.

The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, dragged by FOUR
GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars. From the looks of it, he's been
here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and
many new bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

                              EVELYN

               But he's just a filthy criminal?

                              JONATHAN (cringing)

               Way to go, Evy.

O'Connell gives Evelyn  the  once over,  then looks  at Jonathan.

                              O'CONNELL

               So who's the broad?

                              EVELYN

               Broad?!

                              JONATHAN

               She's my sister, actually.

                              O'CONNELL

              Yeah? Well, ....I'm sure she's
              not a total loss.

Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out  the door.

                              WARDEN

               I'll be back in a moment.

                              O'CONNELL (sarcastic)

               I tremble with anticipation.

A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face bounces off the
metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks back and gives the Guard a
nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

                              EVELYN

               We uh,...found .... your puzzle box,
               and we've come to ask you about it.

                              O'CONNELL

               No.

                              EVELYN

               No?

                              O'CONNELL

               No. ...You came to ask me about
               Hamunaptra.

Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards didn't hear him.
They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

                              EVELYN

               How do you know the box pertains
               to Hamunaptra?

                              O'CONNELL

               Because that's where I found it.
               I was there.

Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

                              JONATHAN

               How do we know that's not a
               load of pig swallow?

O'Connell  looks  closer  at  Jonathan,  a  glint  of  recognition.

                              O'CONNELL

               Hey,....don't I know you?

                              JONATHAN

               Um, well, you see....

O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan square in the
jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His
head bounces off the bars again. He shows no pain, but gives the Guard
another nasty look. Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at
O'Connell.

                              EVELYN

               You were actually at Hamunaptra?

                              O'CONNELL

               I just decked your brother

                              EVELYN

               Yes, well, (shrugs) I know my brother.

O'Connell  almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, I was there.

                              EVELYN

               You swear?

                              O'CONNELL

               Every damn day

                              EVELYN

               No, I mean--

                              O'CONNELL

               --I know what you mean. I was
               there, alright. Seti's place.
               The City Of The Dead.

                              EVELYN

               What did you find? What did you see?

                              O'CONNELL

               I found sand. I saw death.

The warden enters.  Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

                              EVELYN

               Could you tell me how to get
               there? The exact location?

                              O'CONNELL

               Want to know?

Evelyn leans in even closer

                              EVELYN

               Yes.

                              O'CONNELL

               Really want to know?

She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous  and excited

                              EVELYN

               Yes.

O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

                              O'CONNELL

               Then get me the hell outta here

Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off the bars again,
but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, YANK him away from the bars
and DRAG him out of the room.

                              EVELYN

               Where are they taking him?

                              WARDEN

               To be hanged.

Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth

                              WARDEN

               Apparently, he had a very good time,

EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as the hangman's
noose is draped over O'Connell's head and cinched tight around his neck.
Evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners
all go dead quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh meat.

                              WARDEN

               No women allowed.

                              EVELYN

               I am an English woman.

This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden

                              EVELYN

               I will give you one hundred
               pounds to spare his life.

                              WARDEN

               I would pay one hundred pounds
               just to see him hang.

                              EVELYN

               Two hundred pounds.

                              WARDEN

               Proceed!

                              EVELYN

               Three hundred pounds!

O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than
Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him

                              HANGMAN

               Any last requests, pig?

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go

The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

                              EVELYN

               FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!

The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

                              WARDEN

               And what else?

Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

-Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the
Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

                              EVELYN

               NOOO!

O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays-out. Then
JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.
But he's still alive, because--

                              WARDEN

               His neck did not break! Good!

Now we watch him strangle to death.

The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.
The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the
end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly
turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

                              EVELYN

               He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

The warden spins around and faces her

                              WARDEN

               You lie.

                              EVELYN

               I would never!

At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and
turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

                              WARDEN

               Are you saying this filthy godless
               son of a pig knows where to find
               The City Of The Dead? Truly?

                              EVELYN

               Yes and if you cut him down,
               we will give you ten percent.

                              WARDEN

               Fifty percent.

                              EVELYN

               Twenty.

                              WARDEN

               Forty.

Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as he
looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

                              O'CONNELL

               Give .... give him .... give him GLAAAA--!

                              EVELYN

               Twenty-five percent, and not
               one single farthing more.

The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic

A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell
CRASHES to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks
up at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

                              CURATOR

               She must die

Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA:
blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, --the works. One of
the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

                              HOOK

               She is like all the others.
               She will die in the desert.

                              CURATOR

               No! She has seen too much. She
               knows too much.

The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

                              CURATOR

               Not only does she have a map,
               but she has the key.

Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

                              HOOK

               The key!? She has the lost key!?

                              CURATOR

               Yes. No one has ever had so much,
               been so close. We must stop her,
               or it will be the end of us all.

                              HOOK

               Then we will kill her, we will
               kill her and all those with her.

                              CURATOR

               And burn the map and retrieve the key.

                              HOOK

               It will be done. But what of
               the American expedition? They
               leave tomorrow as well.

                              CURATOR

               Forget the bumbling Americans,
               they will be like all the others.
               without the map to guide them, how
               can they possibly find Hamunaptra?

EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI,

                              BENI

               It is three days down the Nile,
               then two days by camel, sahibs.

WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a
PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS,

                              DANIELS

               For all the money we're paying
               you, something better god-damned
               well be under that sand.

WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

                              HENDERSON

               "Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's
               all ya gotta keep sayin, to
               yourself, "Hamunaptra."

Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the
docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn
and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS
selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

                              EVELYN

               Do you really think he'll show up?

                              JONATHAN

               Undoubtedly, I know the breed,
               he may be a cowboy, but his
               word is his word.

                              EVELYN

               Personally, I think he's filthy,
               rude and a complete scoundrel.
               I don't like him one bit.

                              O'CONNELL (o.s.)

               Anyone I know?

They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit
and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more
dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

                              EVELYN

               Oh .... um,...hello.

Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

                              JONATHAN

               Smashing day for the start of
               an adventure, eh, O'Connell?

O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, sure, smashing.

He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the
bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

                              BURNS

               You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

                              BENI

               Along with the scorched bones
               of my entire garrison, sahib.

And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head,
as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men.

                              BENI

               A thousand pardons, my good sahibs
               but there is much work to be done.

Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

                              EVELYN

               Mister O'Connell, can you look
               me in the eye, and guarantee me
               this is not some sort of flimflam?
               Because if it is, I'm warning you--

--O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space
looks her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

                              O'CONNELL

               All I can tell you, miss, is that my
               Colonel found that map in an ancient
               fortress, and the whole damn garrison
               believed in it so much, that without
               orders, we marched halfway across
               Libya and into Egypt to find that city.
               Like I told ya, all I saw was sand.
               Everybody else was wiped-out by
               Tuareg warriors. I'll take your bags.

O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto

THE SAME PASSENGER BARGE THAT BENI AND THE AMERICANS ARE ON.

Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, yes, you're right, filthy,
               rude, a complete scoundrel,
               nothing to like there at all.

Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's when
the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat.

                              WARDEN

               A bright good morning to all.

                              EVELYN

               What are you doing here?

                              WARDEN

               I have come to protect my
               investment, thank you very much.

And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the
Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into--

EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

--The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS
MUMIA quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The
one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other
two row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell
comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

                              JONATHAN

               Sit down, O'Connell, sit down,
               we could use another good player.

                              O'CONNELL

               I only gamble with my life,
               never my money.

                              DANIELS

               Never? What if I were to wager
               five hundred dollars says we
               get to Hamunaptra before you?

O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yer on.

Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

                              BURNS

               What makes you so confident, sir?

                              O'CONNELL

               What makes you?

Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

                              HENDERSON

               We got us a man who's actually been there

O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan

                              JONATHAN

               I say, what a coincidence, why--

--O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the
gunny-sack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

                              JONATHAN

               --whose deal is it? Is it my deal?
               I thought I just dealt?

EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.
The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

                              O'CONNELL

               Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya

                              ELVELYN

               The only thing that scares me,
               Mister O'Connell, are your manners,

                              O'CONNELL

               Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

                              EVELYN

               If you call that a kiss.

O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out
revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun,
and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

                              EVELYN

               Did I miss something? Are we
               going into battle?

                              O'CONNELL

               The last time I was at that place
               everybody I was with died.

This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts
dismantling and cleaning the guns.

                              O'CONNELL

               There's something out there, you
               know, something under that sand.

                              EVELYN

               Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain
               artifact, a book, actually, my
               brother thinks there's treasure.

               What do you think is out there?

O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

                              O'CONNELL

               Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin
               believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,
               they call it, "the doorway to hell"

                              EVELYN

               Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway
               to the underworld", actually.

She gives him a know-it-all grin.

                              EVELYN

               I don't believe in fairy tales
               and hokum, Mister 0'Connell, but
               I do believe that one of the most
               famous books in history is buried
               out there, The Book Of The Living
               It's what first interested me in
               Egypt as a child. It's why I came
               here, sort of a life's pursuit.

                              O'CONNELL

               And the fact that they say it's
               made out of pure gold, makes no
               nevermind to you, right?

Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

                              EVELYN

               You know your history.

                              O'CONNELL

               I know my treasure.-

Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns
back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

                              EVELYN

               By the way, ...why did you kiss me?

O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders

                              O'CONNELL

               I was about to be hanged, seemed
               like a good idea at the time.

Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed

                              O'CONNELL

               What? .... Wha'd I say?

Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly
reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

                              BENI

               My very good friend! What a surprise

                              O'CONNELL

               Why if it ain't my little buddy,
               Beni. I outta kill you.

O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows
hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

                              BENI

               You never were any good with
               the ladies, O'Connell.

                              O'CONNELL

               So you're the one leading the
               Americans, I shoulda figured.
               So what's the scam? You get 'em

out in the middle of the desert

then leave 'em to rot?

                              BENI

               Unfortunately no, these Americans
               are smart, they pay me only half
               now, half when I get them back to
               Cairo, so I must go all the way.

O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

                              BENI

               You never believed in Hamunaptra,
               O'Connell. Why are you going back?
               The devil himself lives out there.


They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the
HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and
backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

                              O'CONNELL

               The girl saved my life, figured
               it was the least I could do,
               keep her out of trouble.

                              BENI

               You always did have more balls
               than brains.

O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni

                              O'CONNELL

               Let's make us even, shall we?

                              BENI

               Even?

O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the
barge. Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his
gunny-sack and starts walking off down the deck.

                              BENI(o.s)

               O'Connell! I am going to kill
               you for this!

                              O'CONNELL

               Sounds familiar.

And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming
up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. She
gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over
her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT
THERE IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his
hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

                              HOOK

               Where is the map?

Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees
the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table,

                              HOOK

               And the key? Where is the key?

Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins,

                              HOOK

               Then I'll find it myself,

He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the
door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.
Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.
O'Connell looks at her.

                              O'CONNELL

               Friend of yours?

Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table
FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell
spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.
FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's
head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

FIRING BLINDLY.-A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene
SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs
the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder,
right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.
O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

HALLWAY - NIGHT

O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

                              EVELYN

               The map! We need the map!

He shoves her up against a wall.

                              O'CONNELL

               Relax! I'm the map!
               (taps his forehead)
               It's all up here.

                              EVELYN

               Oh that's comforting.

O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward

                              O'CONNELL

               C'mon, there's still one more of
               those guys around here somewhere.

EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye
and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on the
floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the door
is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him
into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

                              JONATHAN

               EVY!!

Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up,
A HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

                              JONATHAN

               Hey that's mine---

it's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.
Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse
paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.
BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.
O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the
other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the
paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their
heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The
Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep
up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now
ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

                              O'CONNELL

               Can you swim?

                              EVELYN

               well of course I can swim, if
               the occasion calls for it.

                              O'CONNELL

               Trust me,

He picks her up and throws her over the side

                              O'CONNELL

               The occasion calls for it.

Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after her.

EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans,
guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING
everything in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

                              JONATHAN

               Americans.

Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, --now a FLAMING TORCH.
Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his
FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes
widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to
strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blow Hook over
the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

                              JONATHAN

               I say! Good show!

Then he points his thumb at himself

                              JONATHAN

               And did I panic?

He lifts up his other hand, --he has the key/box back.

                              JONATHAN

               I think not.

And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan
dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the
water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she
wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices. Everybody
else, including the horses, is getting out on the far shore
O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

                              BENI

               Hey O'Connell! Looks to me
               like I got all the horses!

                              O'CONNELL

               Hey Beni! Looks to me like your
              on the wrong side of the river!

Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand
CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking ........

BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading
post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them
the reins of four ugly old camels.

                              JONATHAN

               I can't believe the price of
               these fleabags.

                              O'CONNELL

               We coulda had 'em for free, all
               we had to do was give 'em your sister.

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

                              O'CONNELL

               Awfully.

And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's
changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

                              O'CONNELL

               Then again....

SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in
the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

                              JONATHAN

               Never did like camels. Filthy
               buggers. They smell, they bite,
               they spit. Disgusting.

The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile
green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his
gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, disgusting.

Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

                              EVELYN

               Well I think they're cute.

WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the
desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

FRYING PAN - NIGHT

The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking
across the vast wasteland.

Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to
the rhythm of his camel. on the camel next to him, the
Warden SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly
starts to slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and
stops her, then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle,
never waking her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn,
and then he looks up at a distant ridge--

--where Ardeth Bay and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing them.

EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as
Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

                              JONATHAN

               And you snore!

                              WARDEN

               I do not snore!

                              JONATHAN

               All night you snored!

                              WARDEN

               I have never snored!

Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

                              O'CONNELL

               We're almost there.

                              EVELYN

               Are you sure?

O'Connell looks down at the ground.

                              O'CONNELL

               Pretty sure.

The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking out
of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the skeletons
look like they're trying to crawl up out of the desert floor.

                              JONATHAN

               what in bloody hell is this?

The Warden shivers in fear.

                              WARDEN

               Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of
the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE
DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel,
the rest ride horses.

                              BENI

               Good morning, my friend!

O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred
feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless
horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

                              DANIELS

               Well, what the hell we doin'?

                              BENI

               Patience, my good sahib, patience.

Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

                              HENDERSON

               First one to the city, O'Connell!
               Five hundred! Cash bucks!

O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.
Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts to
rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

                              O'CONNELL

               Get ready.

Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

                              EVELYN

               For what?

                              O'CONNELL

               we're about to be shown the way.

Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the
sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.
Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then--

                              DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS

               HEYA!

The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

                              DANIELS

               SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!

Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

                              JONATHAN

               Ah, begging your pardon, but
               shouldn't we be going?

                              EVELYN

               After all, you rode us night
               and day to win that bet.

O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard.
Beni watches the Americans and spits into the sand.

                              BENI

               Fools

And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.
Passing across the sun as it goes. --It's a MIRAGE.
The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other
way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.
The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.
The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the
volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell
and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And
the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from his
horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to
the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.
The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.
And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.
And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else
hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.
And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.
Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell.
Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!
But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni
off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.
Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never
felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this
girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of
the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past
him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

                              O'CONNELL

               Evelyn! Slow down!

Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

                              O'CONNELL

               SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN!
               THERE'S A REALLY BIG--

INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

--Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands
in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.
O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

                              O'CONNELL

               Never mind.

The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside
the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

                              O'CONNELL

               You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

ext. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy
hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three
Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats
flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty
backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

                              DANIELS

               Where'd all these camels come from?

                              BENI

               They belong to the dead. They
               will wait years for their
               masters to return before leaving.

EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next
to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.
O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of
the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan
bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS
and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

                              JONATHAN

               That thing gives me the creeps.

                              O'CONNELL

               Be nice. That thing saved my life.

Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

                              EVELYN

               That "thing" gets me excited

                              O'CONNELL

               (sarcastic)
               The things that get you excited.

                              EVELYN

               According to Bembridge Scholars,
               inside the statue of Anubis was
               a secret compartment, perhaps
               containing The Book Of The Living.

                              O'CONNELL

               What are those mirrors for?

                              EVELYN

               Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice

INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell- waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden
drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

                              EVELYN

               Do you realize, we are standing
               inside a room that no one has
               entered in over four thousand years.

                              WARDEN

               Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

                              O'CONNELL

               You're welcome to my share of
               the spider webs.

                              JONATHAN

               And it stinks to high heaven in here.

Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

                              EVELYN

               Cretins.

Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden and
realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops sniffing.

Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall,
then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF

LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. --THE RAY OF LIGHT
HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE
DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT RAYS
SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's chamber.

                              O'CONNELL

               That is a neat trick.

                              EVELYN

               Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

                              O'CONNELL

               Preparation for what?

                              EVELYN

               For entering the afterlife

O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him,

                              JONATHAN

               Mummies, my good son, this is
               where they made the mummies.

Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way
through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat
warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and
freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.
They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker
and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and
louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan
licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

ANUBIS CHAMBER - DAY

They slowly creep -out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of
an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.
Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the
other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn
behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

O'Connell LEAPS OUT. --THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT
HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because
it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

                              HENDERSON

               Ya scared the bejeezus out of
               us, O'Connell.

                              O'CONNELL

               Likewise.

But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

                              DANIELS

               This here is our statue,...friend.

                              O'CONNELL

               Don't see your name on it,...pal

And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step
out of the shadows, --all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

                              BENI

               Ten to one, O'Connell, your
               odds are no-so-good.

                              O'CONNELL

               I've had worse

Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, me too,

O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun,
grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then
Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

                              EVELYN

               Let's be nice, children, if
               we're going to play together,
               we must learn to share.

Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.
Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing. The
Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the
ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

                              EVELYN

               According to my calculations,
               we should be right under the
               statue. We'll come up right
               between his legs.

(she blushes and laughs)
               Oh my.

                              JONATHAN

               And when those dirty Yanks go
               to sleep--

(looks at O'Connell)

               No offense.

                              O'CONNELL

               None taken

                              JONATHAN

               --We'll sneak up and steal that
               book right out from under them.

                              O'CONNELL

               And you're sure you can find the
               secret compartment?

                              EVELYN

               Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't
               already found it.

Jonathan looks around.

                              JONATHAN

               I say, what's our smelly little
               friend got himself up to?

INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.
A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of
black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred
beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and
starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's
found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist
brushes sand away from the seam . Henderson steps forward and
grabs the seam, --the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               Seti was no fool.

Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

                              HENDERSON

               Yeah, sure....

He looks back at the native Diggers.

                              HENDERSON

               We'll let him open it.

The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.
The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out his gun,
aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers hesitantly step
forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. The other
Diggers back away, scared shitless. Beni and the Americans
exchange looks, and then they back away as well.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

                              O'CONNELL

               Lemme get this straight, they
               stuck a sharp, red hot poker up
               your nose, cut your brain into
               small pieces, then ripped it
               all out through your nostrils?

                              JONATHAN

               OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

                              EVELYN

               It's called mummification.
               You're dead when they do this

                              JONATHAN

               still....

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

                              EVELYN

               You two are worse than a couple
               of schoolboys.

And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.
O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES
for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE
CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

INT. ANLIBIS CHAMBER -

Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their
guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less,
he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS--

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               FENI!

The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give,
The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The
compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers
give one final pull and--

--AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS THE
THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM. Dying
horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the ground ......

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan
slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.
We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEPIS SARCOPHAGUS.

                              EVELYN

               Oh my god, ...it looks like,
               it looks like a sarcophagus.

                              O'CONNELL

               Why would they bury somebody
               in the ceiling?

                              EVELYN

               They didn't, they buried him
               at the foot of Anubis. He was
               either someone of great importance.
               or he did something very naughty.

INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then
greedily-starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops
it into his pouch, --only he misses, and this scarab quietly
falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.
The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to
WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.
Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB--BEETLE
scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly
burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his
knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg,
higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a

large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS
IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The
Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The lump
BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and COUGHING.
And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus,
revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it
Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

                              JONATHAN

               Well? .... Who is it?

Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

                              EVELYN

               'He that shall not be named.

O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

                              O'CONNELL

               There's some sort of lock here.
               You say these thing's are made
               of granite with a steel interior?

                              EVELYN

               Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

                              JONATHAN

               Whoever's in here, sure wasn't
               getting out.

                              O'CONNELL

               No kiddin', without a key, it'll
               take us a month to crack this thing,

                              EVELYN

               A key! That's it! That's what he
               was talking about.

                              O'CONNELL

               Who was talking about what?

Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

                              EVELYN

               The man on the barge. The one
               with the hook, he was looking
               for a key.

Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back,

                              JONATHAN

               Hey that's mine!

Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, --it's now
shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles. And
that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through
the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the
labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden
starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and
Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed,
he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the
labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The
Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring,
breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves ..............

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

                              EVELYN

               What do you suppose killed him?

                              JONATHAN

               Did you ever see him eat?

O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

                              O'CONNELL

               Seems the Americans had a little
               misadventure of their own today,
               three of their diggers were killed.

                              EVELYN

               How?

                              O'CONNELL

               Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
               Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

                              JONATHAN

               Maybe this place really is cursed

A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp. The campfire FLICKERS
O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous look. Evelyn laughs.

                              EVELYN

               two!

                              O'CONNELL

               don't believe in curses, huh?

                              EVELYN

               No. I believe if I can see it
               and I can touch it, then it's
               real. That's what I believe.

O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

                              O'CONNELL

               I believe in being prepared.

Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the
scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY
PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then,
--Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the
pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

                              O'CONNELL/EVELYN

               WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!

Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch
and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

                              JONATHAN

               Seagrams!

Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside-
out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

                              JONATHAN

               Well, he may have been a stinky
               fellow,....but he had good taste

Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily

And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to
the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then a
BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.
O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

                              O'CONNELL

               Stay here!

He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately
gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the
bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

                              JONATHAN

               Evy! Excuse me! But didn't
               the man just say--!

EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS
gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as
they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill
multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps
SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.
O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni,
who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

                              O'CONNELL

               Goin' somewhere?

                              BENI

               Just looking for you, O'Connell!
               I wanted to be with my friend!

O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

                              O'CONNELL

               C'mon, friend.

                              BENI

               (struggling)
               Why do you like to fight so much?

                              O'CONNELL

               'Cause I look good doin, it.

Ardeth Bay gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down
with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks,
LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to
the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point
blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Bay's hand. O'Connell
is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off,
misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider
off his mount. The horse BOLTS. --But Ardeth Bay is gone.

Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly,
she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly
backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises
his scimitar, about to strike. Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a
rock and FIRES the elephant gun, --BLAM! Blows the Rider off
his mount and CATAPULTS him twenty feet back into some ruins.

At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and over
a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand dune.

Jonathan and some - Diggers are holding their own near the
temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

                              JONATHAN

               Let 'em have it, boys!

Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears,
the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

                              JONATHAN

               I say, bloody good show.

And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land
behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around
and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.
O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something
THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Bay
on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively
raises his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!
Hits his gun, --CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed,
O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick
of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It
IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Bay, towering above him. The two men
lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Bay points
his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

                              ARDETH BAY

               LEAVE THIS PLACE! .... LEAVE THIS
               PLACE OR DIE!

Ardeth Bay GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after
him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave,
then turns to the burning fuse, ....and blows it out. Evelyn
staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her
and holds her close.

                              O'CONNELL

               You alright?

Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time
he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's
also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

                              EVELYN

               Yes, ...fine, ...thank you.

Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and
Burns help Daniels to his feet.

                              DANIELS

               See! That proves it! Old Seti's
               fortune's gotta be under this sand!

                              HENDERSON

               For them to protect it like this,
               you just know there's got to be
               treasure down there.

O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

                              O'CONNELL

               These men are a desert people
               they value water, not gold.

Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

                              EVELYN

               Where's Jonathan?

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.
Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close
and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.
O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves,
the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the
bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly--

                              EVELYN

               Unlike my brother, sir, I know
               when to say no.

O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

                              O'CONNELL

               Unlike your brother, Miss, you
               I don't get. You're a whole new brew.

                              EVELYN

               I know, you're wondering, what's
               a place like me doing in a girl
               like this?

                              O'CONNELL

               Something like that.

                              EVELYN

               Egypt is in my blood. My father
               was a famous explorer, he loved
               Egypt so much that he married
               an Egyptian my mother! who
               was quite an adventurer herself

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay, I get your father, I get
               your mother and I get your brother,
               but what are you doing here?

Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

                              EVELYN

               I may not be an explorer, or an
               adventurer, or a treasure hunter,
               or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell
               But I'm proud of what I am.

                              O'CONNELL

               And what is that?

Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins
and proudly lifts her head high.

                              EVELYN

               ..... am a librarian!

She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

                              EVELYN

               I'm going to kiss you, Mister
               O'Connell.

                              O'CONNELL

               No you're not.

                              EVELYN

               I'm not?

                              O'CONNELL

               Not unless you call me Rick

                              EVELYN

               Why would I do that?

                              O'CONNELL

               Because that's my name.

She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES HER.
Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, slumping
into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and just smiles.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and
turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are
heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.
PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

                              EVELYN

               .I can't believe I allowed the
               two of you to get me drunk.

                              JONATHAN

               Don't blame me, I don't even
               remember being there.

                              EVELYN

               well neither do I, thank you.

O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

                              O'CONNELL

               You don't?

Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

                              EVELYN

               No . .... Why? .... Should I?

                              O'CONNELL

               Gee, yeah, you told me it was
               the best time you ever had.

O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops,
appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF
and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly
grab their sore heads and MOAN.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the
secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.
Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out
the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.
Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               There is a curse upon this chest.

                              DANIELS

               Curse My ass.

                              HENDERSON

               Yeah, who cares.

The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               In these hallowed grounds, that
               which was set forth in ancient
               times, is as strong today, as
               it was then.

                              HENDERSON

               Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it

The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               "Death will come on swift wings
               to whomever opens this chest".

A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER
All-the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.
The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               It says, there is one, the undead,
               who if brought back to life, is
               bound by sacred law to consummate
               this curse.

                              HENDERSON

               Yeah, well, let's just make sure
               we don't bring anybody back from
               the dead then, huh?
               The three Americans laugh.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               He will kill all who open this
               chest, ...and assimilate their
               organs and fluids.

                              DANIELS

               Assimilate their organs and fluids?
               Ya mean eat 'em?

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               And in so doing he will regenerate.
               And no longer be the undead, but a
               plague upon this earth.

The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and the
Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just shrugs.

                              HENDERSON

               Ah hell, let's open it anyways,

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next
to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

                              EVELYN

               Oh my god, love dreamed about
               this ever since I was a little girl.

                              O'CONNELL

               You dream about dead guys?

Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and
cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

                              EVELYN

               Look, all the sacred spells have
               been chiseled off. The hieratics
               and hieroglyphs that protect the
               deceased on his journey into the
               afterlife, they've been removed.
               This man was cursed, ....doomed.

O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care

                              O'CONNELL

               Tough break.

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, I'm all tears, now let's
               see who's inside, shall we?

Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box
into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a
HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs
the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan
helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.
And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT-
INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

                              O'CONNELL/EVELYN/JONATHAN

               AHHHHH!!!

They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the
'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years
have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

INT. ANUBIS'-CHAMBER - DAY

Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden
chest.  Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background,
Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

                              BENI

               The curse, ....beware the curse!

turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

                              DANIELS

               Stupid superstitious bastard.

And that's when the seal breaks, --A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT
OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and
carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out

                              O'CONNELL

               is he supposed to look like that?

                              EVELYN

               No. I've never seen a mummy look
               like this.  He's, he's still...

                              JONATHAN

               Juicy?

                              EVELYN

               Yes. He's more than four thousand
               years old and still decomposing.

                              O'CONNELL

               And look at this.

O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there
are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

                              EVELYN

               Oh my god, he was buried alive,

This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer,

                              EVELYN

               And he left a message.

WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

                              EVELYN

               It says: 'Death is only the beginning*

Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

                              O'CONNELL

               Where's my gun?

                              JONATHAN

               What are you going to do?
               Shoot him?

                              O'CONNELL

               If he decides to wakes up, hell yes!

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed at
the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches inside,
and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes widen in
excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly
pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book Imhotep
used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               I have heard told of this book,
               but I never truly believed it
               existed. This, good gentlemen,
               is a most priceless treasure.

Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

                              HENDERSON

               I wouldn't trade ya for a brass
               spittoon!

                              DANIELS

               Yeah! It's supposed to be made
               outta pure gold!

Daniels kicks the chest. it breaks open, unfolding to reveal
a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL
ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni
are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan
wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

                              JONATHAN

               What is this stuff? It smells
               like our late friend, the warden.

O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

                              JONATHAN

               You did not!? .... We're not!?

                              O'CONNELL

               Rat gizzards. They smell bad
               and taste worse, but that's the
               best the desert has to offer.

The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

                              HENDERSON

               Say O'Connell, whadaya think
               these honey's'll fetch back home?

                              BURNS

               we hear you gentlemen found yerselves
               a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

                              DANIELS

               Ya know if ya dry him out, you
               can sell him for firewood.

The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a
pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

                              EVELYN

               Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found
               them inside our friend's coffin.
               They can stay alive for years
               living off the flesh of a corpse,
               or in this case ........

She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

                              EVELYN

               famished.

O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

                              O'CONNELL

               Are you saying somebody threw
               these things in with our guy,
               and they slowly ate him alive?

                              EVELYN

               Very slowly.

                              JONATHAN

               He certainly was not a popular
               fellow when they planted him.

                              O'CONNELL

               Must of got a little too frisky
               with the Pharaoh's daughter.

                              EVELYN

               According to my readings, our
               friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the
               worst of all ancient Egyptian
               curses, one reserved for only
               the most evil blasphemers. In
               all of my research, I've never
               read of this curse actually
               having been performed.

                              O'CONNELL

               That bad huh?

                              EVELYN

               Yes, they never used it because
               they feared it so. it's written,
               that if a victim of the HOM-DAI
               should ever arise, he would bring
               with him the ten plagues of Egypt.

                              O'CONNELL

               The ten plagues? ... You mean all
               ten plagues.

                              BENI

               Like what that Moses guy did
               to that Pharaoh guy?

                              EVELYN

               That's one way of putting it.

                              JONATHAN

               Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
               locusts....

                              BURNS

               Hail and fire.

                              HENDERSON

               The sun turning black.

                              DANIELS

               Water turning to blood.

                              JONATHAN

               And my personal favorite: people
               covered in boils and sores.

All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just
laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

                              EVELYN

               Fried gizzard anyone?

EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple and
steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the Egyptologist,
his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the Book Of The
Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn stares at the Book,
nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully
steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over
and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

                              O'CONNELL

               You sure you outta be playin,
               around with that?

                              EVELYN

               It's just a book, no harm ever
               came from a book.

Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell
share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

                              EVELYN

               Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

INT. IMHOTEPIS CHAMBER - NIGHT

Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's
chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN
over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards
Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills
FRAME, --and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!
Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. --BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around,
sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

                              EGYTOLOGIST

               NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!

He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard,
coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all
leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the
darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops
everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their
side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid
vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The Book
Of The Dead, looking haunted.

                              EGYPTOLOGIST

               What have we done?

The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth,
slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

                              JONATHAN

               Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!

Billions of grasshoppers!

                              O'CONNELL

               That's one of the plagues, right?
               The grasshopper plague!

                              EVELYN

               This is not a plague. It's
               generational. Every so many
               years the locusts of Egypt
               have a population explosion
               and they all take flight.

Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers
his TORCH, --the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay, ....and what about frogs?

INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.
Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the
ground, they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to
his feet, squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

                              BURNS

               Daniels! Henderson!

INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to
SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, --HUNDREDS OF
CHITTERING SCARAB-BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start
scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.
Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul-ass.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out in
front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything. Then
ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps out.

                              BURNS

               Daniels? .... is that you?

Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

                              BURNS

               Henderson?

Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands
reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEPIS PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns
jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at
them, --HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts
to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase,
just ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next
to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of
the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs
scurries between them, their ear-piercing CRITTERS send
shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.
Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and
Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then
they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

                              JONATHAN

               EVY!?

SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully
looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels
her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft of
MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A MAN
stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards him.

                              EVELYN

               Oh thank goodness, you're one
               of the Americans, aren't you?

Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF
HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.
Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating,
she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around
It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is
down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, her
dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

                              IMHOTEP

               Anck-su-namun?

LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

                              O'CONNELL

               Damn-it! Must be a trap door
               around here or somethin'.

And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson,
Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

                              HENDERSON

               RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!

O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of
CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly
trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and
help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as
the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through
him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels
Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already
running, races right past them. The others turn and haul-ass.

SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

Imhotep steps forward, --the sand around him seems to
MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal
legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

                              EVELYN

               Help me, ...please, ...help me.

Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because
HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the
ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a big
game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his
fetid lips, --A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

                              IMHOTEP

               Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying
around the corner and runs right up to her.

                              O'CONNELL

               Would you quit playin, around!
               Let's get outta here already!

O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, --at
the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

                              O'CONNELL

               WHOA!

O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.
Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering his
prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts to
crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops and
UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches to an
inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial SHRIEK.

                              IMHOTEP

                ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his
fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him--

                              O'CONNELL

               Ahhhhhhhh!!

Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the
SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his
ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn
stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN
ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell
and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson,
Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees,
hands over their heads. Ardeth Bay steps forward.

                              ARDETH BAY

               I told you to leave or die, you
               refused, and now you may have killed
               us all. For you have unleashed the
               creature that we have feared for
               more than four thousand years.

                              O'CONNELL

               Relax, I got him.

                              ARDETH BAY

               No mortal weapons can kill this
               creature. He is not of this world.

                              O'CONNELL

               Are we talkin, about the same
               creature? The walking corpse?
               Really big mouth? Really bad breath?

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

Beni sloway backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He
turns around, --IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs
away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but have
no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the back
wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless. Imhotep
moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy
guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side.
Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his neck,
'RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain. Beni
holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly
makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

                              BENI

               May the good Lord protect and watch
               over me as a shepherd watches over
               his flock. And may Satan in all his
               forms be vanquished forever.

It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni
quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them
out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his
progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a
Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.
All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and
Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for
Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.
And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses
himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand
lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

                              IMHOTEP (subtitled)

              The language of the slaves.

Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

                              IMHOTEP (in Hebrew - subtitled)

               I may have use for you.  And
               the rewards will be great.

Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out
his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes,
about to throw up, but then the maggots part, --revealing a
tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises
his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

                              IMHOTEP (subtitled)

               Where are the other sacred jars?

EXT . CREVICE - NIGHT

Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant
sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

                              DANIELS

               You bastards!

                              HENDERSON

               What did you do to him!?

                              ARDETH BAY

               We saved him! Saved him before
               the creature could finish his work
               Now leave, all of you, quickly,
               before he finishes you all.

                              JONATHAN

               You're not going to kill us?

Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

                              ARDETH BAY

               We must now hunt him down, and
               try and find a way to kill him,
               before he consumes the earth.
               Allah be with us.

Ardeth Bay and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.
O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself-

                              O'CONNELL

               I told ya, I already got him!

Ardeth Bay stops and looks back, deadly serious.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Know this, the creature will be
               coming for you. He must consummate
               the curse. And until he does, he
               will never eat, he will never sleep,
               and he will never stop.

Ardeth Bay turns and jumps down into the crevice,

EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels
and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist,
still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.
They all head off into the dark, windblown desert ..........

And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY
PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC,
PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE---

IMHOTEP

ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!

EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front
gate. our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty
camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.
O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

                              O'CONNELL

               I thought you didn't believe
               in this stuff!?

O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

                              EVELYN

               Having an encounter with a four
               thousand year old walking-talking
               corpse tends to convert one.

                              O'CONNELL

               Forget it, we're out the door
               down the hall and gone.

                              EVELYN

               No, we are not,

O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk,

                              O'CONNELL

               Oh yes we are.

O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues
to UNPACK them:

                              EVELYN

               No we are not. We woke him up,
               and we must try and stop him.

                              O'CONNELL

               We?! What we?! You didn't
               read that book. I told you not
               to play around with that thing.

                              EVELYN

               Alright then, Me, I, ...I read the
               book, I woke him up and I intend
               to stop him.

O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

                              O'CONNELL

               How!? You heard the man, no mortal
               weapons can kill this guy.

Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

                              EVELYN

               Then we'll have to find some
               immortal ones.

                              O'CONNELL

               There goes that alieff again. Not
               me, I am outta here!

O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.
Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.
O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking
his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

                              EVELYN

               According to that Book, once
               this creature has been reborn,
               his curse will spread, and as
               he grows in strength, so will
               his curse grow, infecting the
               people until the whole of the
               earth is destroyed.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah? So? Is that My problem?

                              EVELYN (incredulous)

               It's everybody's problem!

                              O'CONNELL

               Look lady, I appreciate you
               saving my life and all, but
               when I signed on, I agreed to
               take you out there and bring
               you back, and I did, now were
               even, end of job, end of story,
               contract terminated.

                              EVELYN

               That's what I am to you? A contract?

                              O'CONNELL

               You can either tag along with me,
               or you can stay here and play
               around with Mister Maggot.

                              EVELYN

               I'm staying.

                              O'CONNELL

               FINE

O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the
door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a
handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni
coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his
face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

                              O'CONNELL

               Beni ya little stinkweed,
               where did you slink off to?

                              BENI

               You left me! You left me in
               the desert to rot.

                              O'CONNELL

               Oh yeah, ....sorry bout that
               (gestures to Imhotep)
               So who's this guy?

                              BENI

               This is Prince Imhotep, High
               Priest of Osiris.

                              O'CONNELL

               Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

O'Connell sticks out his hand, --Imhotep instantly recoils
O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

                              BENI

               The Prince does not like to be
               touched by other humans. A Silly
               eastern superstition, I'm afraid.

                              O'CONNELL

               Yeah, well, we all got our
               little problems today don't we?

                              BENI

               He has come to help Mister Burns
               Somehow I feel responsible.

                              O'CONNELL

               Don't gimme that, you never had
               any scruples.

                              BENI

               Do you know where I can steal some?
               O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives
               Imhotep a look as he strides off.

                              O'CONNELL

               See ya around, Padre.

Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

INT. CASBAH - DAY

The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and hard
liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a walrus
mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.  He
wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

                              WINSTON

               I'm the last of the Royal Force
               still stationed here, you know?
               All the other laddies died in the
               air and were buried in the sand.

The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to
O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

                              WINSTON

               Ever since the end of the Great
               War, there hasn't been a single
               challenge worthy of a man like me.

                              O'CONNELL

               I've heard it before, Winston,

O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

                              WINSTON

               I just wish I would've chucked
               it with the other laddies,
               gone down in a flame of glory,
               instead of sitting around here,
               rotting from boredom and booze!

Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods
Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment

                              BURNS

               The drawer there, spectacles.
                (tries to laugh)
                As you see, I won't be needing them.

Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He puts
the bifocals on over his death mask, --and grins broadly, his
rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

                              BENI

               Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep
               thanks you for your spectacles,
               - and for your eyes, ....and
               for your tongue.

The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

                              BENI

               But I am afraid more is needed,
               the Prince says he must finish
               the job, consummate the curse
               which you and your friends have
               brought down upon yourselves.

A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly
backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the
sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing
his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

INT. CASBAH - DAY

Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and
Henderson slug 'em down, --all three of them instantly SPIT
OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

                              HENDERSON

               Sweet Jesus! That tasted just
               like, ....like...

                              O'CONNELL

               Blood.

They all look at each other, even more nervous.

                              JONATHAN

               "And the rivers and waters of
               Egypt went red and were
               as blood."

A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

                              O'CONNELL

               He's here

He sudden1y jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

                              JONATHAN

               Who's here!?

                              O'CONNELL

               The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound,
knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

                              O'CONNELL

               Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of
books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops
half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and
drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

                              O'CONNELL

               We got problems.

And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the
courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain
bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell
and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and
CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

                              O'CONNELL

               He's here! I saw him! That thing
               is here!

                              EVELYN

               The creature!? Are you sure!?

O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the
HAIL and FIRE.

                              O'CONNELL

               Pretty sure!

The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.
O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM
is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.
O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant who
is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they spot
Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, --HIS
BODY IS SHRIVELLED TO HALF IT'S SIZE. Drained of all organs
and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are shocked. Then they hear
a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep standing on the far side of
the room. O'Connell draws his gun.

Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful new
musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and REFORM.
His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and CRYS OUT,
in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks like an
incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell. The
'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

                              O'CONNELL

               we are in serious trouble.

Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

                              O'CONNELL

               Back off, creep

Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep
Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're
all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep
in the face, --HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEPIS SKULL AND GETS
STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it, shocked,
then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of Imhotep's
face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist quickly
DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as if
O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort,
THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others
knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that
just grabbed O'Connell, --IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.
He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall,
terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

                              IMHOTEP (subtitled)

               You saved me from the undead.
               For this, I shall make you immortal.

He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.
Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins
into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.
Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

                              HENDERSON

               The curse the curse

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn
across the Ramesseum.

                              EVELYN

               There's only one person I know
               who can possibly give us some
               answers.

They round a corner and come upon the Curator, --who is
talking with Ardeth Bay. Everybody stops.

                              EVERYBODY

               YOU!

O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns.
Ardeth Bay just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

                              CURATOR

               Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

                              EVELYN

               What is he doing here?

                              CURATOR

               Do you truly wish to know? or
               would you prefer to just shoot us?

Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

                              O'CONNELL

               I just saw my fist vanish into
               some guy's head.

He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

                              O'CONNELL

               I'm willin, to go on a little
               faith, here.

                              CURATOR

               You will not believe it

                              O'CONNELL

               Try me.

INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The
First.  We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits
on Seti's throne.

                              CURATOR

               We are part of an ancient secret
               society, the cult-of-the-Mumia,
               and we have a sacred mission,
               passed down through thirty-nine
               generations. For over four thousand
               years we have guarded The City Of
               The Dead. we are sworn at manhood
               to , do any and all in our power to
               stop the High Priest Imhotep from
               being reborn into this world.

                              ARDETH RAY

               And because of you, we have failed.

                              EVELYN (appalled)

               And you think this justifies
               killing innocent people!?

                              CURATOR

               To have stopped this creature? Yes!

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's
               afraid of cats, what's that about?

                              CURATOR

               According to the ancients, cat's
               are the guardians at the gates of
               the underworld. Imhotep will fear
               them until he is fully regenerated,
               and then he will fear nothing.

Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

                              DANIELS

               Right! And ya know how he gets
               fully regenerated?! By killing
               everybody who opened that chest
               and sucking us dry! That's how!

                              CURATOR

               Yes, the creature must first try
               and regenerate, and then he will
               attempt to resurrect the one he
               has loved for more than four
               thousand years.

                              EVELYN

               Anck-su-namun.

The Curator and Ardeth Bay look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

                              EVELYN

               In the necropolis, when I saw him,
               alive, ...walking, he called me
               Anck-su-namun. And then in Mister
               Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.

                              CURATOR

               It is because it was you who read
               from the Book. He has chosen you to
               be-the human sacrifice needed to
               regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

                              JONATHAN

               This is not good. Not good at all

Ardeth Bay has been staring out a wall of windows.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Tonight is the full moon. The moon
               of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

Everyone follows Ardeth Bay's eyes, through the windows we
can see the SUN, --which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

                              JONATHAN

               "...and he stretched forth his
               hands towards the heavens, and
               there was darkness throughout
               the land of Egypt."

EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning
the walls. Above and beyond them, --is the BLACK SUN.

EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

                              EVELYN

               we must stop him from regenerating.
               She turns to Daniels and Henderson

                              EVELYN

               Who opened that chest?

                              HENDERSON

               Well, there was me and Daniels here
               and then poor Burns of course, oh
               yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

O'Connell turns from the window

                              O'CONNELL

               What about my buddy, Beni?

                              DANIELS

               Naw, he scrammed outta there,

                              EVELYN

               We must find the Egyptologist
               and bring him back here to the
               safety of the fort, before the
               creature can get to him.

O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay, ...Evelyn, you wait here,
               you two come with me.

All three of them pounce on him at once--

                              HENDERSON

               The hell with that! I'm not
               goin' nowhere! we're safe here.

                              DANIELS

               Yeah, I'm not leavin, this
               fort for nothin'.

                              EVELYN

               Who put you in charge? You can't
               just leave me behind like some old
               suitcase. I'm the one responsible
               for this mess and I intend to be
               the one to clean it up.

O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.
Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the
door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room
we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

                              O'CONNELL

               Keep an eye on her. If you leave
               her door, I'll rip your spleen out
               C'mon, Jonathan.

Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself

                              JONATHAN

               Me?

CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking
haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and his
SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking him. A
STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed face.

He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers
his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading
into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO--

THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files
and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket
watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he
starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

                              O'CONNELL(o.s.)

               well, well, well.

Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

                              O'CONNELL

               Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a
chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into a
wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up the
wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

                              O'CONNELL

               Where's your new friend?

                              BENI

               what friend? You're my only friend

O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin

                              O'CONNELL

               Then you got no excuse for living.
               What the hell you doin, being
               buddies with this creep, Beni?
               What's in it for you?

                              BENI

               It is better to be the right hand
               of the Devil,....than in his path.
               As long as I serve him, I am immune.


                              O'CONNELL

               Immune from what?

                              BENI

               You shall see.

                              O'CONNELL

               What are you looking for?
               Lie, and I'll slit your throat

O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

                              BENI

               The book! The black book they
               found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep
               wants it back. Said to me it
               would be worth it's weight
               in diamonds.

                              O'CONNELL

               What does he want the book for?

                              BENI  (shrugs)

               Something about bringing his
               dead girly-friend back to life
               He needs the book....

               (looks at Jonathan)

               And your sister.

O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES
O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.
Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

                              JONATHAN

               That looked rather painful

                              O'CONNELL  (wincing)

               Ya know, ever since I met you,
               my luck has been for crap.

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, I know, I do that to people

And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming from
down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to the
window and look out--

EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing
away from the SHRIVELLED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred
canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's
Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and
catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; his
jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a huge
SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight up
at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.
The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread
throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

EGYPTOLOGISTS OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked

                              O'CONNELL

               Damn-it! That's two down and
               only two to go.

                              JONATHAN

               And then he'll be coming after Evy.

They turn and race out of the office.

BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at
the front gate. more Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

                              SOLDIER

               Ten O'clock! All is well!

The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair next
to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with fear.

                              DANIELS

               The hell with this. I'm goin,
               downstairs to get me a drink.
               You want somethin,?

                              HENDERSON

               Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a
               shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser

Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone,
smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his
SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes in
through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson gets
up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS
Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.
His body TWISTS and TURNS and Slowly SHRIVELS as the life is
SUCKED out of him. Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the
wall above him, the SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses,
forming a SHADOW of a human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the
body REGENERATES. And then it's over.

Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and
looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps
over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door,
rattles the knob. it's locked. Imhotep grins.

EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in through
the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large mound. Evelyn
starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO THE DOOR: The mound
of sand is gone and in it's place is Imhotep.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a
stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.
O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob,
still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she
sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.
Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth
instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the
bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes-up. Sees Imhotep's
rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.
Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

                              O'CONNELL

               Get your hands off my girl, pal.

Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces
O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

                              O'CONNELL

               Nice lips.

Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

                              O'CONNELL

               I figured you might be here,
               so I brought a friend.

He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively
catches it. He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back
towards the window, --which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep
spins like a dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.
Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES
out the window and vanishes over the compound.

Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.
O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on
the floor . .... and drops the martini glasses.

INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets,
HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell,
looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

                              EVELYN

               You called me your girl?

                              O'CONNELL

               What? ... Oh yeah, that was just
               um, you know, figure a speech.

                              EVELYN

               I think you were jealous

                              O'CONNELL

               Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did
               you see that guy's face?

Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

                              DANIELS

               Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta
               do somethin'! we gotta do somethin,
               NOW! Before it's too late!

They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling
with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins
to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people
begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a
severe sickness. --It's already too late.

Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half
rotted off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is
at his side, looking very nervous. And then, one-by-one',
the people silently begin to follow Imhotep, their skin
now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS AND SORES.

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Bay
fo11ow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

                              EVELYN

               Last month I came across an
               inscription that mentioned
               The Book Of The Dead.

                              DANIELS

               That book we found at Hamunaptra?

                              EVELYN

               Yes. I dismissed it, because it
               talked about bringing people
               back from the dead. A notion
               I was unwilling to believe.

                              O'CONNELL

               Believe it, sister. That's what
               brought our buddy back to life.

                              JONATHAN

               And now he's going to use it
               to bring his girlfriend back

                              ARDETH BAY

               And if he succeeds, the two of
               them together will bring about
               the apocalypse.

The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the
stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

                              THE CURATOR

               The plagues we have seen so far,
               are merely Imhotep flexing his
               muscles. only at the moment of
               Anck-su-namun's resurrection
               will he be truly invincible.

They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

                              EVELYN

               I'm thinking that if the black
               Book Of The Dead can bring people
               back to life--

                              CURATOR

               --then perhaps, the golden Book
               Of The Living can return them
               to the underworld.

                              EVELYN

               Exactly -

                              O'CONNELL

               So your sayin', if we find the
               book made outta gold--

                              CURATOR

               --And read the sacred incantations
               contained inside it.

                              O'CONNELL

               You think it'll send this guy
               back to hell?

                              CURATOR

               Correct,

And that's when LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside
They all rush over to the upper windows and look down--
OUTSIDE: A large, CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores
comes CHANTING up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

                              ARDETH BAY

               it has begun. The beginning of
               the end.

                              EVELYN

               Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon,

Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are
locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while
CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the
Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.
The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

                              EVELYN

               Got it!

                              O'CONNELL

               Got what?

The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn
talks while quickly translating the tablet:

                              EVELYN

               Since the black Book of The Dead
               was found inside the statue of
               Anubis, then according to this,
               the golden Book of The Living
               should be inside ........

Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

                              O'CONNELL

               what?

                              JONATHAN

               What?

                              DANIELS

               WHAT!?

                              EVELYN

               The golden Book Of The Living,
               is inside the statue of Koz-us.

                              CURATOR

               Which would be located not far to
               the east of the Anubis statue.

                              O'CONNELL

               Don't tell me we gotta go back
               out there?

                              CURATOR

               If we want to kill the creature, yes.

TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway,
SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay grab them and chuck them
over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into
the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN,
The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul-ass
across the balcony and down the staircase.

EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his
convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob
comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs
his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING---

                              JONATHAN

               Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors
of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it
up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Bay and the Curator jump
inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

                              BENI

               Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper
windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points a
finger at Beni as they race past him.

                              O'CONNELL

               You're gonna get yours, pal!

Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman
size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out
of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

The convertible hauls-ass down the narrow bazaar street.
Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the
car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them
overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car,
CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not
before they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels
out. He TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs
into a corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble,
killing several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty,
CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him
like rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.
The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them
and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down
his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket,
and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He
holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through
his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased
mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM ........

INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE
DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to
O'Connell. Ardeth Bay and the Curator are still in the back.
All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.
Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the
windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses
control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

                              O'CONNELL

               C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob
quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his
gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way
to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth
Bay's stubbly face. Ardeth Bay YELPS. O'Connell holds the lit
match near the fuse.

The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth,
staring at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

And then Imhotep steps through, --having fully regenerated,
he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the
day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

                              EVELYN

               He's gorgeous.

O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He
YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it
across Ardeth Bay's face again. Ardeth Bay YELPS and gives
O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

                              THE CURATOR

               He has consummated the curse,
               now all he need do is raise
               Anck-su-namun from the dead,
               then it will be the end of us,
               and the beginning for them.

Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell
LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops,
watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The
tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the
stick of dynamite, blowing it up, --when Evelyn leans forward
and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on
Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

                              IMHOTEP

               Koontash dai na.

Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

                              BENI

               Take his hand and he will
               spare the others.

Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty
crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars,
waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident,
powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

                              EVELYN

               Any bright ideas?

O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

                              O'CONNELL

               Sorry, fresh out.

Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to
take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her,
--but Ardeth Bay grabs them both and holds them tight.

                              O'CONNELL

               Don't do it, Evelyn.

                              EVELYN

               I have no choice.

Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes
around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

                              IMHOTEP

               Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

                              BENI

               Come with me my princess. It is
               time to make you mine, forever.

Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him--

                              EVELYN

               All eternity, idiot,

Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

                              EVELYN

               You better think of something,
               because if he turns me into a
               mummy, your the first one I'm
               coming after.

O'Connell almost smiles

                              O'CONNELL

               Got guts, lady.

                              EVELYN

               Yes, I know, and I'd like to
               keep them.

Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and--

RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

                              JONATHAN

               Hey that's mine--!

Ardeth Bay holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.
O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of
Ardeth Bay's grip.

                              O'CONNELL

               Evelyn!

The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Be calm. There is still time.
               we can stop him yet.

The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep
stops and looks back at O'Connell.

                              IMHOTEP

               Pared oos.

Evelyn SCREAMS.

                              EVELYN

               NOOO!!

Beni smiles.

                              BENI

               Kill them.

Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Bay's
grip and stumbles forward.

                              O'CONNELL

               EVELYN!

But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.
O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE
COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after
him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Bay towards the cistern hole.

                              CURATOR

               Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth Bay
crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator apart.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay slosh their way down the
watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a
LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then
more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Bay ahead
of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby
fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air,
followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE ..............

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan
and Ardeth Bay climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

                              O'CONNELL

               We gotta get her back.

                              JONATHAN

               I'm with you, old man. No one
               touches my sister like that and
               gets away with it.

O'Connell looks at Ardeth Bay,

                              O'CONNELL

               You know where he's taking her?

                              ARDETH BAY

               Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform
               the ritual.

Jonathan looks worried.

                              JONATHAN

               And what ritual would that be?

                              ARDETH BAY

               The ritual to bring the body of
               Anck-su-namun back to life.

                              JONATHAN

               And how does one do that?

                              ARDETH BAY

               By reading the Book Of The Dead.

                              JONATHAN

               Oh yes, of course.

                              ARDETH BAY

               And then killing your sister.

                              JONATHAN

               Excuse me?

Ardeth Bay looks at O'Connell,

                              ARDETH BAY

               Imhotep is now able to cross the
               desert with great haste.

Jonathan taps him in the shoulder,

                              JONATHAN

               Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
               quite clear on that last part.

Ardeth Bay ignores him,

                              ARDETH BAY

               If he arrives before us, it will
               be too late.

                              JONATHAN

               Did you say 'kill' my sister?

O'Connell smiles

                              O'CONNELL

               I know how to beat him to it.

And on that WE SMASH CUT TO-- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN
Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set
of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with
R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP

EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay stand before Winston
Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

                              WINSTON

               So what's your little problem
               got to do with His Majesty's
               Royal Air Corp?

                              O'CONNELL

               Not a god-damned thing.

Winston looks intrigued.

                              WINSTON

               is it dangerous?

                              O'CONNELL

               You probably won't live through it,

This really interests him.

                              WINSTON

               By Jove, do you really think so?

                              JONATHAN

               Everybody else we've bumped into
               has died, why not you?

Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

                              WINSTON

               So what's the challenge then?

                              O'CONNELL

               To save the damsel in distress,
               kill the bad guy and steal his
               treasure.

A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives them
a snappy salute.

                              WINSTON

               Winston Havlock at your service, sir!

SAHARA - DAY

Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the
dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to
dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it,
they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS
INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

                              EVELYN

               what just happened?

                              BENI

               All I remember is him turning
               into a blast of sand, ....and
               then I remember nothing.
               then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

INT. BIPLANE - DAY

The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in
the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle
across the left wing, Ardeth Bay is tied tight to the right.

Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

EXT. SAHARA - DAY

Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size,
he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. --And
a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

BIPLANE - DAY

O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise
up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees
what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the
plane into a dive.

                              WINSTON

               Hang on, men!

WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting
biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.
O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT
FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.
O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and
FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the
sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw
unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.
Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

                              WINSTON

               We're going down!

The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING.
Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Bay SCREAMING. Winston
Havlock LAUGHING.

                              WINSTON

               Here I come, laddies!

O'Connell braces himself for impact,

SAHARA - DAY

Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

                              EVELYN

               Stop it! You'll kill them!

Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare
into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes
herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES
upside-down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell
falls out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is
jammed into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

                              JONATHAN

               Excuse me. ...A little help
               would be useful. ...IF IT'S
               NOT TOO MUCH TROUBLE!!

O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Bay stumbles over to
the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's
mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a
cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell
and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the
sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make it to some rocks and
look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides
away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane
vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND ...........

HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay come down a ravine in the
volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay, now what the hell does
               this Horus guy look like?

                              JONATHAN

               He's a big fellow with pointy
               ears and a face like a falcon.

                              O'CONNELL

               Got it

HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay make
their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading
into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

NECROPOLIS - DAY

Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery.
She stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying
through the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves
his rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

                              BENI

               Keep moving

Evelyn gives him a look.

                              EVELYN

               You know, nasty little fellows
               such as yourself, always get
               their comeuppance.

Beni suddenly looks worried.

                              BENI

               Yeah?

                              EVELYN

               Oh yes, always,

Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on
his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the
disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

O'Connell and Ardeth Bay are busy digging out a collapsed
doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

                              JONATHAN

               I say, look at that.

He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in
his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to
glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

                              JONATHAN

               Say, gents! You should come
               have a look at this.

The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the
scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into
Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The
scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips
out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's
arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in
front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being
cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying
back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, --BLAM!

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and
Beni step6up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years
ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a
CANOPIC JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-
namun's heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts
reading from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust
against a mausoleum wall, --THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.
TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking
mummified CORPSES. , Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests. They
bow to Imhotep,-then turn and move off down a passageway.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

O'Connell helps Ardeth Bay mend Jonathan's wound.

                              O'CONNELL

               From now on, don't touch anything.
               Not a damn thing. Keep your hands
               off the furniture, got it?

Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni
holds his gun on her, translating:

                              BENI

               Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

                              EVELYN

               Tell him, I'm truly flattered.
               ... but that it's already taken.

Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel
encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

                              BENI

               He wants your heart and your
               brain, your liver, your kidneys...

Evelyn's eyes widen

                              BENI

               ... and how do you say? Those
               slimy things, in your stomach?

                              EVELYN

               Intestines

                              BENI

               Yeah! Them.

Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

                              EVELYN

               You only want me for my organs?!

Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her --WAP!
Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold,
malevolent, then h e turns and walks off into the mausoleums.
Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and
drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his gunny-
sack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan and
Ardeth Bay crawl in behind him.

O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting
through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a
wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his
gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning
the mirror into the shaft of light, --And WHAM! THE SHAFT OF
LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM FROM
ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.
It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing.
Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay are speechless.
that's when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

                              O'CONNELL

               who the hell are these guys?

                              ARDETH BAY

               Priests. Imhotep's priests.

O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

                              O'CONNELL

               I never killed a priest before,

                              ARDETH BAY

               They are evil, cursed, they
               matter not.

                              O'CONNELL

               Well, okay then.

O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.
BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips
through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy,
b1ows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the
loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

                              O'CONNELL

               Oh come on, gimme a break here.

And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning
over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

INT. CEMETERY -DAY

Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS
echoing out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into
another of Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty
liver and crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a
passage from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

                              IMHOTEP (ancient Egyptian - subtitled)

               Kill them! Kill them all! And
               bring me the Book Of The Living!

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan
and Ardeth Bay back away from the mummy pieces. The floor
where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two
more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More
mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the
piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes. O'Connell
lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Bay stops him.

                              ARDETH BAY

               My turn.

Ardeth Bay OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit out
of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now. O'Connell
OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING as all
three of the men back away and haul-ass. The mummies and
mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at all
the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and
rolls about.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Evelyn-wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar.
 She blink!, then turns her head, --and looks right into
the ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into
the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay race down a
passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

                              O'CONNELL

               This whole place is comin, alive!

The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around
another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical.
Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Bay

FIRING as they go. Ardeth Bay goes empty.

                              ARDETH BAY

               I'm out

He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into--

HORUS CHAMBER - DAY

--A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of
HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

                              JONATHAN

               There he is!

They run up to the base of the statue,

                              JONATHAN

               Hello Horus old boy.

O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the
passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out
a stick of dynamite. Ardeth Bay taps him on the shoulder.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Allow me.

O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to
look at the statue. Ardeth Bay reaches forward and strikes
the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.
Ardeth Bay lights the dynamite and throws it down the
passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.
Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing
the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way
out, --another dark, creepy passageway.

INT. CEMETERY

Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly
struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start
surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous
mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, --which now sounds
even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and
mouths in the room.

Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead.
His hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's
decayed cheek.

INT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the
secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth
Bay spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the
dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

                              O'CONNELL

               These guys just don't quit.

Ardeth Bay grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and
runs off towards the mummies.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Keep digging!

O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder
on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.
The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?
Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts ................

And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND
and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST
up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with
the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another
grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A
third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL
THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in
the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

INT. CEMETERY

Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

IINT. HORUS CHAMBER - DAY

Ardeth Bay BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies.
over at the base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull
an ornate chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips
off the lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he
reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD Book
Of The Living- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces as they
stare at it in wonder.

The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Bay takes it by the
barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

                              ARDETH BAY

               Save the girl! Kill the creature!

The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.
O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it
against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

                              O'CONNELL

               That's the last one, we better
               get lucky.

The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, --but now here's a hole for
them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through the
hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag
filled with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.
Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.
Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him and
he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the door.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock
back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.
Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling
hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and
into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.
The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and
IMHOTEPIS READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty
EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with
empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then
she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

                              IMHOTEP (subtitled)

               with your death, my love and
               I will be invincible!

He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.
Evelyn's eyes widen in horror And that's when O'Connell
and Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

                              JONATHAN

               I found it, Evy! I found it

                              EVELYN

               Shut-up and get me off of here!

O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand,
jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.
The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.
Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial
knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests
stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

                              EVELYN

               Open the book, Jonathan! Open
               the book! That's the only way
               to kill him!

O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies,
fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly
SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan
fumbles with the book, struggling to open it, --he can't.

                              JONATHAN

               I can't open it! It's locked
               or something!

O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his
sword down at Evelyn, --CLANG! One chain breaks free.

Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS
along the binder. It hits him like lightning--

                              JONATHAN

               We need the key!

Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain
around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket

He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

                              JONATHAN

               What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

                              EVELYN

               Read the inscription on the cover!

O'Connell swings his sword down again, --CLANG! Evelyn now
has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell
force him back.

Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription,
but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

                              JONATHAN

               .Keetash-something, naraba-something.

Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching
the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

                              JONATHAN

               Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm--?

Jonathan trips and falls on his ass.  Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.
O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding
Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

                              JONATHAN

               Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.
And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES
through the wall, --shades of Ray Harryhausen. only better.

The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares
angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

                              JONATHAN

               Oh boy

O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

                              O'CONNELL (sarcastic)

               This just keeps gettin,
               better and better.

Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.
O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword,
frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack,
forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to
head for O'Connell, --a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her
around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for
O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus
moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

                              O'CONNELL

               Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

                              JONATHAN

               You have got to be joking?

Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

                              EVELYN

               Finish the inscription, idiot!

                              JONATHAN

               Oh.

Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best
she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on
the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure-

                              JONATHAN

               Ummm, Hootash im .... Hootash
               im now what is this
               last symbol here?

                              EVELYN

               What's it look like!?

Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of
Anubis corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with
it's MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan
stares at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

                              JONATHAN

               It's an Anck symbol, with two
               little squiggly lines above it,
               and a bird, a stork! on either side,

Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun,

                              EVELYN

               -Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

                              JONATHAN

               Yes, ...I see.

The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

                              JONATHAN

               Hootash im Ahmenophus!

The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks
and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell
slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away,
Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream
just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to
powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily
heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly
backpedals on his hands and heels.

O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for
Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the
golden Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a
wall.

O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, --WAP!
SLICES Imhotep's 'right arm off. It drops to the ground, still
clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and
spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

                              O'CONNELL

               Okay pal, let's see how tough
               you are without your right arm.

Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him half
way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a gravestone,
bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes it off.

                              O'CONNELL

               Alright, ...so he's left handed

Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up
his hand, --HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

                              JONATHAN

               I got it!

Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten
flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. on the outside, Imhotep
looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.
Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.
O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS
him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,
SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage
in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS into
Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in the
face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with him.
He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.
Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, --Imhotep's severed
hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn
yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working
the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum,
swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, --it CLEAVES
through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and
casually flings it away.

The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan
holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages
Looking for something.

O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat
and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed
mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, then
starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About to die.

Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

                              EVELYN

               Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal!
               Pared oos! PARED OOS!!

Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror
on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which
starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out
of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The
mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits
attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

Imhotep let's go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.
Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits,
Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of
The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the
golden book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks
like he's about to cry.

Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's
body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the
beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. one
last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep
is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet,
he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword
scrapes Imhotep's chest, --a swath of blood appears across
Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the
blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him
backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus
bog. The sword still in his stomach.
Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as
Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And
then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at
them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

Evelyn translates:

                              EVELYN

               Death is only the beginning.

Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile

STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight
of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large,
ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag
over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF
DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.
ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons
of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls-ass out of the chamber.

CEMETERY - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls
start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

                              O'CONNELL

               C'mon!

He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking
pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower
and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick
the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure
chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the
treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again
and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards
a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of
the sinking walls is deafening.

Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn
and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a
staircase. heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already
half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet
high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.
Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives,
but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of
time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand--

                              BENI

               O'CONNELL!!

O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand
back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.
Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as
the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks
around with his diminishing torch.

All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's
trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over
in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.
Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

                              BENI

               Go away

He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens
upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.
And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.
And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a
pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING
CREVICE DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through
the front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind
them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the
wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels
race out into the desert ..........

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PLATEALT - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the
plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the
sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

                              JONATHAN

               Well, ...I guess we go home
               empty handed.

O'Connell looks at Evelyn

                              O'CONNELL

               Wouldn't say that.

Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her
arms around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell ret urn s it.
Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs
up onto a camel.

When the kiss is-over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile,
then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs
Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her
arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

                              O'CONNELL/JONATHAN

               TUK-TUK-TUK!!

The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag
behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, --we can
see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.

THE END
