More info about this movie on IMDb.com


INT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.

We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,
blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small
containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up
colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little
color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and
four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant
Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.

We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his
domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,
uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,
they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge
has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a
COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.

          SAM
     Double double decaf low-fat Cap.

          BRUCE
     You got it, buddy.

          SAM
     Good choice very good choice.

Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet
'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half
     low, half non.  Excellent choice.  Very
     good choice.

He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the
logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches.

          GEORGE
     Sam, they called.  It's time for you to
     go.

Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around.

          GEORGE (CONT'D)
     Sam, did you hear me?

          SAM
     "It's time for you to go."

          GEORGE
     Yes.

          SAM
     It's time.

          GEORGE
     Good luck.

Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY

Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street. 
He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for
anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT
BETWEEN THEM.

          SAM
     It's time.  It's time.

Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping. 
Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     It's time, it's time for you to go.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324.

          SAM
     Rebecca!

Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A
HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.

REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is
the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that
stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black
Nurse, looks up from the monitor.

          GERTIE
     You the one responsible for this?

Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.

          SAM
     I'm sorry.

          GERTIE
     Too late for sorries, daddy, get over
     here and hold her hand.

Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER
CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS.

          NURSE
     You got a live one, Gert.

INT. LABOR ROOM - LATER

          DR. JAMISON
     Okay, this is it!

          SAM
               (spins in circles)
     This is it!  This is it!

          DR. JAMISON
     And it's a girl...

The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck. 
Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to
Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks
over to Sam.

          GERTIE
     There's someone who's been waitin' an
     awful long time to see you, Sam.

She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole
body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,
but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in
quiet amazement:

          SAM
     This is it.

          GERTIE
     What's her name?

          SAM
               (looks at clock)
     Let me see let me see let me see. 
     12:17, March 2nd.  Lucy in the Sky with
     Diamonds.  Recorded March 2nd.  1967. 
     Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul
     McCartney.  Lucy Diamond Dawson.

We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a
river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..."

EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING

Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,
walk down the steps of the hospital holding their
complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the
precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus
pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they
can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks
to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around
and no sign of her. 
Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of
her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He
screams.

          SAM
     Becca!  Becca!

The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's
no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block
holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.

We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but
she's gone."

                                    SMASH CUT TO:

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is
the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two
cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is
surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground
at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two
against the world.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN

A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on
hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded
T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A
carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift
bookshelves.

Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's
things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an "Hold
Everything" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been
transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers
lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a
clothes line of baby clothes.

The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera
follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a
blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An
exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He
swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back
to sleep.

          SAM
     Didn't you just fall asleep, little
     girl?
               (Lucy cries harder)
     Okay, if you say it's time to get up,
     then it's time to get up, time to get
     up.
               (Sam sniffs the air)
     Oh my, oh my, oh my.  Quite a bit of
     business.

He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's
pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with
promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals",
the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers,
Go!"  Sam undoes it.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.  Let me
     see let me see let me see.

Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to
pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     You look very beautiful this morning,
     very beautiful.

He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.

                               CUT TO:

We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf:

HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS...

INT. WALMART - DAY

Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.  He reaches
for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the
Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in
place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA
AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He
stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG "HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY"

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M.

Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M.

Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted,
but she's just getting started.  He puts another blanket on
her.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M.

Peace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the
cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate. 
He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!"  He doesn't
get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he
picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.

          RASPY WOMAN (O.S.)
     What the hell are you doing to that
     baby?!

He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor
on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a
strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a
uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.

          SAM
     Everything's so tiny, tiny.  Tiny. 
     Everything.  Won't you please come over? 
     Help.  I need somebody.  Won't you
     please please help me.

          ANNIE
     You know I can't do that.  What does her
     mother say?

          SAM
     Her mother?  Her mother said "This isn't
     my life.  I'm outta here when she comes. 
     It didn't mean anything, Sam.  It was
     just one night.  The two of you.  That's
     all I need..." Annie, what if she's
     sick?

EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

ANNIE has her door open a crack.  Annie feels the baby's
forehead.  Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated.

          ANNIE
     She's overheated and not eating enough. 
     How often are you feeding her?

          SAM
     A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber.

          ANNIE
     What's a lot?

          SAM
     Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Three
     squares hot.

          ANNIE
     Babies need food every two hours, Sam.

          SAM
     Oh.  I'm sorry Lucy Diamond.

          ANNIE
     What time does the little diamond wake
     up?

          SAM
     She never really goes to sleep.

          ANNIE
     Okaaaay.  Well, let's assume she's up at
     six.  Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.  I
     want you to feed her first while
     "Bewitched" is on.  Then again, when
     "Hogan's Heroes" starts.  After that,
     well until "Father Knows Best..."

                                        CUT:

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

We are watching "Hogan's Heroes".  We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS
RESPONSE: "I know nothing, absolutely nothing!"  Sam feeds a
content Lucy.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER

"Father Knows Best" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in
Sam's arms.  Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places
her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN.

Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani
gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a
large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees
himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah
Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the
world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB.

          SAM
     What are you doing here now?!  Her first
     sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound.

          BRAD
     Eight years every Thursday Video Night
     and you forgot?!

          SAM
     Oh my god, Video Night.  First Thursday
     of the month.  Video night at Sam's
     house.  I'm sorry, I forgot.

          IFTY
     Becca's gone.  "Gone with the Wind" is a
     very sad movie.

          ROBERT
     Oh here we go...Everything changes now. 
     Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night
     Denny's and Friday night Karaoke.  And I
     got hit by a car today.

          SAM
     You did?

          ROBERT
     It's probably that guy from the V.A.

          BRAD
     What guy?

          ROBERT
               (closing window)
     I can't discuss it.  And now this.

Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt.

          SAM
     She looks smart, doesn't she?

          IFTY
     Of course, look.  She's already reading
     the newspaper.  I have five smart
     sisters in Pakistan.  I am only brother. 
     "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a
     wonderful movie I forgot to bring last
     week for Video Night...

          BRAD
     Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight?

          ROBERT
     Now it's all my fault?!

          BRUCE
     Don't tell me you forgot again.  I broke
     a date with a daydream to come here.

There's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad
moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing
in the doorway.

          BRAD
     Mom!  I told you Video Night's over at
     nine!  It's only six-thirty!

          ESTELLE
               (unaware of the baby)
     Sorry.  I'll wait in the lobby.

She exits.  Lucy begins to CRY.  Brad takes her - like a hot
potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles.

          IFTY
     She needs motion.  My father drove my
     sisters in his taxi to get them to go to
     sleep.  Two-fifty surcharge on all
     taxi's from the airport...

          ROBERT
     I got hit by a taxi on Tuesday.

And it all starts again and we --

                               CUT TO:

EXT. BUS - NIGHT

An empty bus makes its way through the city at night.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

          BUS DRIVER
     Main and Temple...again.  She out yet?

The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the
back.  Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm,
almost asleep.

          SAM
     Almost there, almost there.  One more
     round and she'll be down for the night.

We hear the song "Golden Slumbers".  In a SERIES OF
DISSOLVES, we see Lucy and Sam in DIFFERENT SLEEPING
POSITIONS on the bus seat.  Gradually, she GROWS in HIS
PROTECTIVE EMBRACE --  

ONE MONTH,  THEN TWO.  NOW FIVE.  She's BIG AND ROUND at SIX
MONTHS.  And on and on into the night...

INT. WALMART'S PHOTO BOOTH - DAY

We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday
hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture.  We see the PHOTO
STRIP as it comes out of the slot.  Sam's shoulder with
Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never
made it into the picture.

INT. STARBUCKS - 8:30 A.M.

The place is packed.  Sam moves from table to table,
cleaning.

          SAM
     Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat. 
     Good choice, very good choice.

Sam turns and WE SEE LUCY attached to him in a handmade
snugly, crocheted by Annie.  She faces outward, all hands,
all 16 MONTHS of her; too big for the snugly.  She grabs a
croissant from a customer.  George looks confused.  Then
makes a SWIPE for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the
ground.  It SPLATTERS all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth
double-latte WOMAN in a designer exercise outfit.  She begins
shrieking.  George looks at Sam, this can't go on.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door.

          SAM
     Please, Annie!  She's too big to take to
     work.

          ANNIE
     I'm not a baby-sitter.  I'm too busy.

          LUCY
     Annie, Annie, Annie...

          ANNIE
               (suspicious)
     Did you teach her that?

          SAM
     It was her first word.  Very first word.

Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in.

          ANNIE
     And people worry you're not smart.

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER

The apartment looks like a fallout shelter.  The kitchen
contains enough canned goods to last a year.  Brightly
colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every
available surface.  The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an
AGORAPHOBE.

Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson.  WE
SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys.  In a SERIES OF
DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note,
now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord.  Until finally
the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star".

          ANNIE
     This is Mozart.  He did twenty-two
     variations of "Twinkle Twinkle Little
     Star".  You smell good.  You can tell a
     lot about a person by their smell.  If
     they've got too much perfume on they're
     covering something up.  You gotta watch
     someone who smells like soap.  Gotta
     wonder what their priorities are. 
     Nervous people.  People who try too
     hard.  They smell like fish.  But you. 
     You smell like milk.  Milk and hope.

Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and
plays with a ball yarn.

          VOICE (O.S.)
     Groceries, Annie.

          ANNIE
     Thanks.

Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries.  The ball of
yarn ROLLS OUT the door and Lucy chases after it.  Annie,
terrified, bellows:

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
     Lucy!  Come back here!  Come back!

It becomes obvious Annie can't walk outside.  Trembling:

          ANNIE (CONT'D)
     "Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."

Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back. 
Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we --

INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

Sam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers,
continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to
Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven.

EXT. PARK - DAY

A beautiful blue sky.  And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO
FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME. 
Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...

Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and
then disappears.  Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by
MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.

          LUCY (V.O.)
     Daddy, where does the sky end?

          SAM (V.O.)
     Let me see, let me see.  I've never been
     there but they say it's somewhere near
     China.

EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER

Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap,
swinging.

          LUCY (V.O.)
     Are lady bugs only girls or are there
     boys, too.  And if there are, what are
     they called?

          SAM (V.O.)
     The Beatles.

EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER

Then Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam.

          LUCY (V.O.)
     Do I look more like you or Mommy?

ON SAM'S FACE

He knew this moment would come.

INT. DENNY'S - THURSDAY NIGHT DINNER - EVENING

Lucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole.

          LUCY
     If you and Mommy liked each other enough
     to have me, how come you're not together
     anymore?

          SAM
     I think she fell out of love with me. 
     Not you, never you.  Me, just me.

          LUCY
     When you fall out of love where do you
     land?

          SAM
     Somewhere in Florida, I think.

          LUCY
     Do you think she'll ever come back?

          SAM
               (long pause)
     Paul McCartney lost his mother when he
     was fourteen.  John lost his mother
     twice.  First when Julie gave John to
     her sister Mimi to raise.  And then
     again when Julia was hit by a car.  They
     say God picks certain people, special
     people.  That's what they say.

Lucy takes this in.  Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just
so... his potatoes just slightly to the left.  Lucy watches.

          LUCY
     Daddy, did God mean for you to be like
     this or was it an accident?

          SAM
     Do you mean - what do you mean?

          LUCY
     I mean you're different.

          SAM
     What do you mean?  I mean, what do you
     mean?

          LUCY
     You're not like the other daddies.

          SAM
     I'm not am I.  I'm sorry.

          LUCY
     Don't be sorry.  I'm lucky.  Nobody
     else's daddy ever comes to the park.

ON SAM'S FACE

Filled with relief.  Bursting with love.

          SAM
     We are very lucky, aren't we?

Grace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the
side.

          GRACE
     Ice cream on the side.

          LUCY
     Not on top.  Not on top.

          SAM
     Good choice.  Very good choice.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY NIGHT VIDEO NIGHT

          SAM
     Brad, I know it was your turn.  I'm sure
     of it.

          BRAD
     I swear to God it was Robert's turn.

          ROBERT
     Why is it always my fault?

          IFTY
     I keep track, last time, I say to
     myself, I say, write it down... Bank of
     America give away beautiful calendar,
     every month a picture of wild animal,
     look June, an Elk.  Elke Sommer...she
     starred in the remake of "Prisoner of
     Zenda"... Three stars Leonard Maltin
     video movie guide.

As they go on, Lucy matter-of-factly PULLS A VIDEO OUT OF HER
BACKPACK, and puts it in the VCR.  She turns it on.  It's
"Kramer vs. Kramer".  Everyone stops their arguing and stares
at Lucy.

          LUCY
     Annie let me borrow it.

INT. CHILDREN'S SHOE STORE - DAY

A row of brand new children's shoes on display.  Lucy tries
on dozens of school shoes, surrounded by Sam and her
"Godfathers": Ifty, Brad and Robert.

          SAM
     You need a good sturdy school shoe. 
     Arches are very important.

          IFTY
     Sturdy is boring.  Red shoes bring good
     luck.

          BRAD
     But red doesn't got with green.

          IFTY
     Except on Christmas.

          BRAD
     No brown clodhoppers.  Everyone will
     make fun of her.

          SAM
     NO ONE will make fun of Lucy.

          ROBERT
     She might be stupid.

          IFTY
     No she's not --

          ROBERT
     Did they test her?

          BRAD
     You don't know for sure.

          SAM
     Yes I do.

          BRUCE
     But if she is, don't make her go to
     school.

          ROBERT
     Don't let her in the lunch room.  Johnny
     Marzettie's there.

          BRAD
     And gym.  Get her a pass.  The rules for
     volleyball are so hard to remember. 
     "Rotate Rackman Rotate."

          IFTY
     Throw the ball at his forehead and the
     water on his brain will come out his
     nose.

Meanwhile, Lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe.

          LUCY
     I like these.

          SAM
     She know what she likes.  She likes
     these.  How much are they?

          SALESMAN
     Forty-nine ninety-nine.

          SAM
     One penny less than fifty.  These shoes
     are one penny less than fifty?

          LUCY
     It's okay, Dad.  I don't really like
     them.

          SAM
     No, no no no no.

          IFTY
     We'll all give ten dollars.

          BRAD
     I've only got three plus five.  But I
     need one for stamps.

          ROBERT
     Don't pull your wad out in front of
     people.

They all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly.

          SAM
     Thank you, thank you.  We are rich in
     friends.  That's what our fortune cookie
     said.  1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes
     one.

          SALESMAN
     I'll count it.

          SAM
     Is it enough?

          SALESMAN
               (exasperated)
     If there's a God.

          BRAD
     Do we get a balloon with these?

          SALESMAN
     Yes.

          ROBERT
     All of us, or just her?

                                    SMASH CUT TO:
EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY

Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of
man's shoes.  We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF
HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march
victoriously down the street.  We MOVE IN on Lucy's little
brown shoes skipping with joy and --

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY

Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black
soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a
fierce kids soccer game.

Score's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses. 
From the sidelines we hear:

          SAM
     Beautiful kick!  Very close!

Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again. 
Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Thatta girl!  Thatta girl!  They're
     getting scared now!

The game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES,
handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son:

          MR. RHODES
     C'mon, Conner!  On your toes!  They're
     all counting on you!

Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down
at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it! 
Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS.

          SAM
     Hurray, Lucy!  You're getting the hang
     of it now!  You've got them scared now!

Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and
NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand
are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic!

          SAM (CONT'D)
     L-u-c-y!  That's our battlecry!

The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie,
Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan
reaming his son --

          MR. RHODES
     The whole game was right in front of
     your nose!  I leave work early to watch
     you blow the whole game!?

Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away. 
Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A child's hand double jumps across a checker board.

          CONNER (O.S.)
     Ha!

Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner. 
Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces
each.

          CONNER (CONT'D)
     What's wrong with your father?  Why's he
     acting like a retard?

          LUCY
     He is.

Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he
pulls his hand away.

          CONNER
     Are you?

          LUCY
     No.

          CONNER
     Are you sure?

          LUCY
     Yeah.

          CONNER
     How do you know?

          LUCY
     He told me.

          CONNER
     But he's a retard.

          LUCY
     Yeah well it takes one to know one!

He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the
first time a bit uneasily.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sam's reading Lucy her homework book.

          SAM
     "They perched in sisisi..."

          LUCY
     "Silence."

          SAM
     "...silence for a long time."  Boy. 
     Your teacher chose a hard book this
     time.  "How can we be so difdifdif..."

          LUCY
     "Different."

Sam glances up at Lucy self-consciously.  Lucy grabs the book
from Sam, tosses it on the pile and picks up another.

          LUCY (CONT'D)
     I don't like that book - let's read
     "Green Eggs and Ham".

Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized
than read.

          SAM
     "I am Sam, Sam I am.  Do you like green
     eggs and ham?  I do not like them, Sam I
     am!"

They both laugh, delighted.  Lucy looks sleepy.

                               MATCH DISSOLVE:

Lucy is getting drowsy.  Sam is just getting started.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     "And I will eat them here and there. 
     Say I will eat them ANYWHERE.  I do so
     like green eggs and ham, thank you thank
     you, Sam I am!"  One more time!

          LUCY
     Daddy, I have school tomorrow...I don't
     wanna be too sleepy.

          SAM
     Just the part about the boat and the
     goat in the rain in the train?

          LUCY
     Daddy, Hamburger Hamlet has twelve
     different kinds of hamburgers.  Can we
     go there Wednesday instead of Denny's?

          SAM
     But Wednesday night's Denny's,
     Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night
     Karaoke.

Lucy nods, a little deflated.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     How about one more time, just the
     beginning?  "I am Sam, Sam I am..."

Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from
"STELLALUNA".

          MISS WRIGHT
     Lucy, your turn.  Start where Sara left
     off...Lucy?

          LUCY
     I can't.

          MISS WRIGHT
     Sure you can.

          LUCY
     "They perched in sisisisi..."

          MISS WRIGHT
     Silence.

          LUCY
               (throws down book)
     There.  I told you.  It's too hard.

          MISS WRIGHT
     Lucy!  I know you can read this!

          LUCY
     No, I can't!  And you can't make me!

Lucy runs out of the class.

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

Sam, in sunglasses, waits for the BUS.  A YOUNG WOMAN, LILY,
sits down next to him.  The WIND CATCHES her floral dress
that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring.  She
reads a TABLOID.

          LILY
     Look here.  "Premature baby claims he's
     cupid - has the arrow to prove it."  Do
     you believe that?

          SAM
     Well, if he has the arrow.

          LILY
     Yeah.  You got a good point.

She crosses her legs.  A tuft of pink dress falls on Sam's
knee.

          SAM
     You're a good reader.

          LILY
     Yeah, I've always been smart.

          SAM
     You're lucky.  I'm looking for a smart,
     good mother.

          LILY
     I can be a mother.  A real good mother.

          SAM
     Oh, good.  Good.

          LILY
     I could even spank you.

          SAM
     Oh no no no.  I don't believe in that.

          LILY
     Okay okay.  I can be very gentle.

          SAM
     Gentle.  Gentle.  Yes.  Do you tell
     stories?

          LILY
     I got stories up the wazoo.  Why don't
     you come with me.  I'll tell you a nice
     story.

          SAM
     I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first.

          LILY
     A menage a toi?

          SAM
     French, French the language of France. 
     You could teach my daughter, Lucy.

          LILY
     Your daughter?!  Can't you pick her up
     after?!

          SAM
     After?!  No no, Lucy comes too.

          LILY
     Whatever.

She takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS
ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs.

          COP
     Not so fast.  You're under arrest. 
     Solicitation.

          LILY
     He wanted to bring his kid, I said no.

A lightbulb flashes and we --

                                    SMASH CUT TO:

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - THAT NIGHT

Sam blinks as his MUGSHOT is being taken.  Now the profile. 
He turns so they can get the back of his head.  Now the
FINGERPRINT.

Now Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making
thumbprints on the wall.  While the COP discusses his case
with a social worker, MARGARET BROWN.  Over the years she's
seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's
just a job.

          COP
     It's the first time in nineteen years I
     actually believe the guy when he says he
     didn't know she was a hooker --

          MARGARET BROWN
     You say that like it's a good thing.

          SAM
     ...Your teeth don't sound like they were
     brushed.  Do it with me now.

          COP
     Let him go.  He says he's never spent a
     night away from his kid... Come with me -
     I got a guy who beat the shit out of his
     two year old.  Again.

Her cell phone beeps.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Yes.  I am seeing you tomorrow, Mr.
     Rabins.  She's still screaming?  No,
     McDonald's won't help...she's four
     months old.

          SAM
     Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on
     the gum line, 1, 2, 3.

Margaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone.

INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

The WALLS are lined with CHILDREN'S ART.  Various
interpretations of the family.  We stop at one of a very
small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him.

          MISS WRIGHT
     It gives us a great deal of insight into
     what she must be feeling.  And in the
     classroom, it's becoming clear she's
     holding herself back.  It's as if she's
     literally afraid to learn.

We PULL BACK and see Sam staring at the picture.  Mrs. Wright
and the principal watch him.

          MISS WRIGHT (CONT'D)
     No one doubts that you love your
     daughter, Mr. Dawson.  But the
     Department of Social Services contacted
     us.  They shared with us that your
     records show that your intellectual
     capacity is around that of a seven year
     old.  Our concern is what happens when
     Lucy turns eight?

          PRINCIPAL
     Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss
     Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy?

          SAM
     No one wanted The Beatles to break up. 
     But you can hear it on the White Album. 
     They were going in different directions.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's bedtime.  Sam and Lucy are reading from "STELLALUNA".

          LUCY
     How can we be so dif..dif...I don't know
     that word.

          SAM
     Yes you do.  It starts with a "d" --

          LUCY
     I'm tired.

          SAM
     I don't believe you.

          LUCY
     Are you calling me a liar?

          SAM
     Yes.  Now read the word.

          LUCY
               (crying)
     No...I'm stupid.

          SAM
     No you're not.

          LUCY
     I don't want to read it if you can't.

          SAM
     It makes me happy.  I'm happy hearing
     you read it.

He holds the book open for Lucy.  Now Lucy, pushing through a
mountain of resistance, reads.  And reads beautifully.

          LUCY
     "Why are we different and so much
     alike?"

INT. SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARADE - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Two children, dressed as Batman, march followed by
CINDERELLA.  We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI
BIRD.  And behind her, marching more proudly than any child,
is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era -
with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest.  Sam is
the only adult participating in the parade.

Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker.  Sam begins to dance with
joyous abandon.  Lucy joins him.  They dance together
happily.

Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning
to laugh.  She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony
around the room.  Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist
and begins to imitate Sam.  Another kid joins him.

          KID
     I'm a Super Freak!

          CONNER
     And I thought my dad was a dork.

Lucy's face hardens for the first time.  In a corrupt world
the pure can only stay pure for so long.

INT. HAMBURGER HAMLET - EVENING

Sam and Lucy sit in a booth.  Lucy's ecstatic.  Sam's trying.

          LUCY
     They have eleven different kinds of
     hamburgers.  This is so great.

          SAM
     A new place.  Your choice.  I said we'd
     go to a new place.  And here we are.

Sam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table.  Lucy
tries to fold a napkin into an Origami bird.

          LUCY
     You know what else I want for my
     birthday, Daddy?  I want a hundred
     birds.

          SAM
     The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's. 
     They make better birds.  There's not so
     much stuff on the tables there either. 
     Why do they have two kinds of mustard on
     every table?

          WAITRESS
     Coffee?

          SAM
     No, no coffee.  Sam's system can't
     handle coffee.

          WAITRESS
     Okaaay!  What can I get you folks?

          LUCY
     I'd like the Benito Bandito burger and a
     chocolate chip milkshake, please.

          SAM
     I'll have the fish special, side of
     potatoes, salad with Thousand Island
     Dressing, cherry pie, and...

          WAITRESS
     I'm sorry, sir.  We don't have a fish
     special.  There's fish and chips.  It
     comes with a dinner salad.

          SAM
     Chips, chips?  You mean potato chips?  I
     don't want potato chips.  I want a side
     of potatoes.

          WAITRESS
     You want french fries?

          SAM
     No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's. 
     A side of potatoes.

          LUCY
     They're little red potatoes.

          WAITRESS
     We don't have new potatoes...

          SAM
     Denny's has new potatoes.  Six new
     potatoes parsley garnish parsley
     garnish...

ON LUCY

Her smile fades.

                                    SMASH CUT TO:

INT. DENNY'S - HALF-HOUR LATER

Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes. 
Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table.  She
doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile
of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is.

          SAM
     Fish and chips fish and chips.  I will
     not eat fish and chips.

          LUCY
               (exploding)
     I will not eat them here or there!  I
     will not eat them anywhere!  I will not
     eat green eggs and ham!  I will not eat
     them, Sam I am!

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!"  For
Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in
the center of the apartment and filling the entire place -
leaving no room for the few kids and their parents.  Brad
stands too close to a young attractive mother.  Robert shakes
all the presents suspiciously.

          SAM
     Now when they come through the door,
     everybody yell "Surprise!"  Do you want
     to rehearse again?

          CONNER
     No.  I bet she already knows.

          ROBERT
     I didn't tell her.  Did Brad say I did?

There's a KNOCK at the door.

          SAM
     Is that Lucy?  Annie's supposed to call
     and warn us.  Shhhh, everyone.

Brad hits the lights.  Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells
"SURPRISE!"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker.

          MARGARET BROWN
     I don't know if you remember me.  I'm
     Margaret Brown from Children's Social
     Services.  We met at the police station.

          SAM
     Put your present over there - Hurry up! 
     Lucy might be on her way.
               (the phone rings)
     Hello?  Annie says she's coming up the
     stairs.  Everyone be quiet.  Assume
     surprise positions!
               (Conner keeps talking)
     Be quiet!  Assume surprise positions!

          CONNER
     Oh brother!

          SAM
     Why are you such a party pooper?! 
     Assume surprise positions!

          CONNER
     Make me!

Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against
him.

          MR. RHODES
     Hey!

          SAM
     He's gonna ruin the surprise!  He's
     gonna ruin the surprise!

          CONNER
     He touched me!  I've got cooties!  I've
     got cooties!

          MR. RHODES
     Get your hands off my boy!

Conner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled
in the MOON BOUNCE!  To get attention, Conner bursts into
tears.  We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the
lights.  We hear a CRASH!  And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS
as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying. 
Then from within the Moonbounce:

          SAM
     Surprise!  Happy Birthday!

Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon.

          LUCY
     Daddy?!

          CONNER
     You don't have to call him "Daddy".
               (in Sam's face)
     She says you're not her real father,
     anyway.  She's adopted!

Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!  The Social Worker watches,
profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone.

EXT. WALMART - DAY

A police car pulls into the parking lot.  Sam and Margaret in
the back.  Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling
from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.

          SAM
     I'll go get her.

          MARGARET BROWN
     It would be better if you stay here. 
     I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's
     clear how much you love your daughter,
     but we're going to have to remove Lucy
     from your home.

Sam's baffled.  One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder,
restraining him.  The OTHER heads toward the photo booth.

          SAM
     No, no no no.  It's her birthday!  It's
     her birthday!

          MARGARET BROWN
     I know how hard this must be...
               (cell phone rings)
     ...Hello, Betsy.  I'm scheduled to come
     to your apartment at four.  No, not five
     every two hours.  It's two every five
     hours.  She only weighs thirty pounds
     for chrissakes...
               (back to Sam)
     The city has given me the difficult task
     of deciding when to intervene on behalf
     of the child.  Unfortunately, I've
     learned the hard way that it's better
     too soon than too late.  For now the
     court will decide what's in Lucy's best
     interest.

Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain. 
Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.

          SAM
     Run, Lucy, run!

We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his
grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She
runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a
cop follows.  Sam struggles.

ON SAM

Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking:

          JUDGE (O.S.)
     Given the fact that the father was
     arrested for solicitation, did not
     cooperate with the police...

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Sam sits ALONE.  At another table, Margaret Brown and a
lawyer, along with several people from the CPS.

          JUDGE
     ...could not control his emotions,
     endangering other children.  Miss Brown
     also cites Mr. Dawson's mental
     deficiencies which raise serious
     questions about his ability to properly
     parent.  I agree to grant petition. 
     The child shall be removed from the home
     until a forma jurisdictional hearing. 
     Mr. Dawson, is there anything you'd like
     to add?

          SAM
     Yes.  I just wanted it to be a nice
     surprise party.  I had gotten the plates
     at Pic-N-Save.  Pink and yellow, pink
     and yellow.  Like a princess.  And the
     balloons at --

          JUDGE
               (gently)
     Mr. Dawson, it sounds like a lovely
     party, but right now I want to talk to
     you about your legal rights.  I would
     strongly suggest you get yourself legal
     counsel and allow your attorney to
     present your case at the jurisdictional
     hearing on February 13th.  Counsel, are
     you available?

          COUNSEL
     Ted, I have a trial that day.

          JUDGE
     February 20th.  8:00 a.m.

          SAM
               (panicking)
     Twenty-two days?  Lucy will come home
     and you want me to bring Lucy back in
     twenty-two days?

          JUDGE
     No, Mr. Dawson.  You'll have supervised
     visits twice a week for two hours.  Now
     I'm sorry, we have thirty more cases to
     see today.  Next!  Hopkins vs. Clifford.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Sam's on the phone, a teddy bear in his hand.  Robert, Ifty,
and Brad all sit with Yellow Pages open in front of them.

          SAM
     Thursday?  Today is Monday, Mrs.  Brown. 
     That's three days away.  That's too
     long.  She can't sleep without Mr.
     Jeeters.  Well if you're not available
     until Thursday, maybe I could see her
     without you there...
     maybe the Judge made a mistake - maybe
     he doesn't know that for seven years I
     played with her without you there...No
     Mrs. Brown, I'm not trying to violate
     the court...
               (the other line hangs up)
     Mrs. Brown?

          ROBERT
     I bet they were recording the whole
     conversation.  Check your phone.  You
     can't make a move.  You need a lawyer.

          BRAD
     Call Jerry Spence.  He has his own show. 
     He must know what he's doing.

          ROBERT
     No.  Johnny Cochran.  He has his own
     show, too.

          BRAD
     Yeah!  He can even get a guilty person
     off.

          SAM
     So you think I'm guilty?

          IFTY
     No.  You didn't kill anybody.

          SAM
     But she said I'm not her father.  

          IFTY
     She didn't say that.  That runty kid
     with the blue shirt and the mean father
     whose voice sounds like the man on the
     Channel Four News who has a toupee. 
     Toupees are expensive.

          SAM
     But Ifty.  She said it.

          IFTY
     But she didn't mean it.  I said I hated
     my mother once.  "Once upon a time..."
     is how stories begin.

          ROBERT
     You should get a personal injury lawyer. 
     You've been personally injured.

          BRAD
     Here - look at this - "Sebastion
     Gibson."  He can do anything. 
     Pedestrians.  Back and neck.  Uninsured
     Motorist.  Dog attacks.

          SAM
     The Social Worker said it's a custody
     case.

          ROBERT
     Then get a divorce lawyer.

          IFTY
     When Dustin Hoffman was trying to keep
     Billy from going back to Meryl Streep,
     his lawyer said it was going to cost him
     fifteen thousand dollars - and that's if
     we win!

          SAM
     Fifteen thousand dollars!

          BRAD
     Don't worry about money now.  Get the
     best.  Century City - Here: "Rubel Bly
     Harrison and Williams".

INT. RITA HARRISON'S CENTURY CITY OFFICE - DAY

A Century City lawyer spins in front of our eyes.  It's SAM'S
POV as he sits in a chair that spins - in the center of RITA
HARRISON'S lavish, penthouse office.  Now we see the
panoramic of Los Angeles.  Now the dots in the Lichtenstein
on the wall WHIRL PAST US.  Now the DOOR SWINGS OPEN AND --

RITA HARRISON and her assistant burst in.  Rita moves in
opposite circles around the room.  Looking for something.  In
fact, as we watch Rita, we realize that she never stops
moving.  Period.  Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy,
too much caffeine, not enough food.  If she slowed down a
beat she might get vulnerable.  Can't have that.  Can't be
wrong.  Can't really look you in the eye.  Can't help it if
she's smarter than anyone else in the room.  Any room.  Any
time.

          RITA
     Did Fred Kimble call?  I'm already
     twenty minutes late.

          PATRICIA
     He --

          RITA
     What'd Michelle Kresge say?

          PATRICIA
     She --

          RITA
     She wasn't defensive, was she?

          PATRICIA
     Well --

          RITA
     That's ridiculous.  What happened with
     my car?

          PATRICIA
     They --

          RITA
     Because it wasn't my fault.

          PATRICIA
     I --

          RITA
     Thank you, Patricia.

          PATRICIA
     This is Mr. Dawson.  There was some
     confusion with the temp last week and --

          RITA
     Mr. Dawson, it's a pleasure.  Since
     somebody made a mistake, unfortunately
     we only have a little time.  Hold all my
     calls unless it's my kid - I'll have a
     double cap.

          SAM
     Good choice, very good choice.

          RITA
     Can we get you anything to drink?

          SAM
     Is it free?

ON RITA

Hmmmm?

TEN MINUTES LATER --

Sam is in the middle of the beginning of his story.  Rita on
her second cappuccino, eyes her computer screen for calls.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     ...Lucy had an ice-cream cake with pink
     flowers - pink, not white not
     white...Lucy's favorite is cherry
     vanilla which is pink, too.  Cherries
     and vanilla.

          RITA
     Uh huh uh huh -- uh huh uh
               (into Amtel)
     If that's Jake Hiller, put him through.
               (picking up phone)
     Jake.  No no no no no no.

          PATRICIA
               (from speaker)
     Your son's on line two.

          RITA
     Jake, did you get that?!  
               (to Patricia)
     Tell him to hold for just one second. 
     Jake I have to go...he what?

          PATRICIA
               (through speaker)
     Deborah Chapman on line three --

          RITA
     Hold on Jake.
               (she punches another line)
     No no no no no no no.  Have a nice
     weekend.
               (punches another button)
     Jake?!

We HEAR MUSIC coming from the other end of the phone --

          SAM
     Burt Bacharach shared billing with The
     Beatles and Jose Jiminez on the Ed
     Sullivan Show June 5th, 1968.

          RITA
     Really?
               (then)
     Jake, what'd you say you tell him yes I
     am.
               (yelling; re: coffee)
     This tastes like low, are you sure it's
     non?  Okay okay okay.  I think there's
     been a little mistake here --

          SAM
     Yes.  A little one.  Your son's on line
     two.

          RITA
     Oh my God.
               (pushes another line)
     Danny?
               (Danny's hung up)
     Patricia?  Get Danny back.  Well keep
     trying.

She unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her
desk sorting out all the yellow ones.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Mr. Dawson, what I'm trying to say is
     I'm a divorce lawyer and as much as I'd
     like to, I don't handle cases like yours
     --

          SAM
     Since you would like to, why don't you
     talk to your boss.  Maybe he would let
     you.

She pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk, now
frantically sorting through them.

          RITA
               (into phone)
     Then keep dialing --
               (to Sam)
     What I mean is that at this point in my
     career, I can't afford to.

          SAM
     I earn eight dollars an hour at
     Starbucks.  I can pay your hourly rate,
     rate by the hour, hourly --

Rita stands up, ushering him to the door.

          RITA
     Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry, I have to be in
     court in eight minutes with the Kresges. 
     You understand, good luck to you and
     don't give up.

She turns, ahhhh!  He's gone!  She begins searching the room.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Patricia?!  Where are my keys?  Where
     the hell are my keys?!  Alright alright.
               (replaying)
     I walked into the room - I went over
     here - I looked at my desk - I put my
     coat down - Patricia?!  Where's my coat?

          SAM (O.S.)
     Is there a child involved in Mr.
     Kresges' case?

Stunned, Rita looks up and sees Sam holding up a strip of
photos taken at the birthday booth.

          RITA
     No.

          SAM
     This is Lucy.  One year old.  First
     word, "apple".  December third.  3:16
     p.m.  December third.

Out of his pocket he pulls another photo strip.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Here's Lucy two years old.  First merry
     go-round ride.  June 6th.  4:13 p.m. 
     June 6th.  Here's Lucy.  Seven years
     old.  The day the police took her away.

Rita looks at the photo strip of Lucy's birthday.  In the
first three we see Lucy's sad face.  The fourth has a cop's
face smashed into the frame with her.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Thank you for telling me not to give up. 
     I won't give up.

          PATRICIA
               (through the phone)
     Danny on Line 2.

Rita LUNGES FOR THE PHONE.

          RITA
     Danny?  Hi.  Could we possibly talk
     about this when I get home.  Danny? 
     Danny?  C'mon.  You're not gonna talk to
     me?  I bought you a bag of your favorite
     lemonade jelly beans.  Danny?
               (Rita starts singing)
     "One little bird in one little tree,
     we're all alone and we don't want to
     be... So they flew far away over the
     trees..." I said "Over the sea..." I
     know the words, I said "Over the sea..."
     Since when don't you like that song? 
     Danny?

She checks her watch, puts him on the SPEAKER PHONE, and
frantically searches the room for her keys.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Danny?

Silence.  We hear SIX LOUD THUDS - the sound of a basketball
bouncing against the floor.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Danny?

CLICK!  The LINE GOES DEAD.  Rita trips over the coffee
table, completely losing it.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     I hate this stupid coffee table - how
     many times have I asked you to get rid
     of this crappy coffee table?

She kicks it, sending the lemonade jelly beans FLYING.  Then,
after a beat.

          SAM
               (from the doorway)
     You did say "over the trees" instead of
     "over the sea."  It's hard to remember
     all the words to all the songs.  There's
     so many.
               (Rita almost stops)
     you have a child Rita rubel Bly Harrison
     Williams.  If they took him away
     wouldn't you hire the fastest talking
     four-named lawyer you could?

          RITA
     Yes, I would.  I went to college with a
     friend who does these kinds of cases. 
     Leave your number.  I'll see if she can
     help you.

          PATRICIA
               (through your phone)
     Your therapist on Line 1.

          RITA
     Tell him you can't find me.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

Sam is face to face with George.

          SAM
     I'm ready.

          GEORGE
     Let's not add more stress to your life.

          SAM
     I'm ready.  I'm ready to make coffee. 
     Lo-fat decaf latte.  Coffee up to here. 
     Add steamed milk up to here.  No foam,
     no foam.  Cinnamon or chocolate
     sprinkles.

          GEORGE
     That's pretty good Sam.  I'll think
     about it.

          SAM
     I know what that means.  I stock shelves
     at Lucky Supermarkets.  I want to bag
     groceries, Miss Losey says "I'll think
     about it."  Randy Brenner gets the job. 
     I was the janitor at the La Reina
     Theater, I wanted to take tickets.  Mr.
     Jenkins said he'd think about it.  Larry
     Peters gets the job.  Lets his friends
     in for free...

          GEORGE
     I promise you, Sam.  I'll honestly think
     about it.  You have my word.

          SAM
     Words, words, words.  I need more than
     that.  I need to pay my lawyer.  I need
     to make coffee.

INT. RUBEL BLY HARRISON AND WILLIAMS - 8:15 P.M.

A group of Rita's colleagues are celebrating a big win.  Rita
is backing out of the room with her glass of champagne.

          RITA
     I am celebrating congratulations to us
     these are the moments good night.

She stops, stunned, as she sees Sam, sitting in the lobby
holding out a Starbucks Cappuccino.

          SAM
     Non-fat vente cap.  I'm sorry to bother
     you, but did you call your friend?
               (Rita's confused)
     Your friend from college, your friend
     who does this kind of work?

          RITA
               (there never was a friend)
     I don't have her number anymore, Sam. 
     We lost touch.

          SAM
               (devastated)
     Oh, that happens.  That happens.  People
     lose touch.  Will you call me if you
     find it?  If you get back in touch?

          RITA
     Yes, I'm just in the middle..it's a
     special..I'll call you.

To avoid any further interaction, she heads back to the
employee party she previously escaped from.  Sam walks down
the hall.

          COLLEAGUE
     Is that the new janitor?

          RITA
     No, it's a case.  Sort of a pro-bono
     thing.

Her assistant Patricia clears her throat.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     What's that supposed to mean?

          PATRICIA
     Nothing.  A cracker went down the wrong
     pipe.

Muffled laughter from her colleagues.

          RITA
     You think I don't pro-bono?..I can do
     pro-bono.. I can do Goddamn pro-bono..
     where the hell are my keys..hold the
     door!

Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with
Sam who's been holding the door open for her.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares
forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her
champagne.

          SAM
     32nd floor.  32 floors more.  31st
     floor.  31 floors more...

And on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously
combust.  Finally, "G" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors,
then just as suddenly turns around.

          RITA
     Alright, alright I'll take you. 
     Alright, Goddammitt, I'll take you.

          SAM
     Oh my God oh my God!  Rubel Bly Harrison
     and Williams!

Sam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the
elevator door starts closing.

          RITA
     No, no  no.  Pro-bono.  Alright?  Pro
     bono.

The doors close.  We hear from within, as Sam goes up again:

          SAM (O.S.)
     Yes!  Alright!  I liked Sonny Bono too!

INT. BUS - MORNING

Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On
his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's
birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and
refrozen.

EXT. BUS STOP - NOON

Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the
bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written
on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper
once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake.

The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam
jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues
on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up. 
Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He
feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is
starting to leak ice cream.

INT. SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY

Lucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for
Sam.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Lucy, I'm sorry.  But it doesn't look
     like he's going to make it.

          LUCY
               (staring forward)
     He'll be here.  You smell like soap.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Lucy, he's an hour and 45 minutes late. 
     You'll only have a few minutes left.

Suddenly through the door comes Sam CARRYING THE MELTED,
DRIPPING birthday cake.  Lucy runs to him.

          LUCY
     Daddy!  I told you I told you!

                               CUT TO:

INT. THE SOCIAL WORKER'S SMALL GREY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret, the therapist (Ms. Geller), and the Child
Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they
observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room,
nervous under their scrutiny.

          SAM
     ...and she's a Century City lawyer - a
     very famous lawyer.  Guess what her name
     is?  Rita Harrison.

          LUCY
               (jaw drops)
     Lovely Rita Meter Maid.

          SAM
     Harrison.  Just like George.

They move to hug each other.  EVERYONE REACHES for their
pens.  Sam pulls back self-consciously.  Everyone writes even
harder.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     You've grown.

          LUCY
     Have I?

          SAM
     Your ears are larger.  And your eyes are
     older.

He's right.  Her eyes are older.  He hugs her - ALL THE PENS
GO UP.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     I'm gonna get a phone machine.  Next
     paycheck.  If I'm not home, you can
     leave a message.  "Hi, This is Lucy."

          LUCY
     You can't afford a phone machine.

The writing starts again.

          SAM
     Yes we can.  I'm in line for a
     promotion.  Big promotion.  A promotion
     that's big.

          LUCY
     They're gonna let you make coffee?!

          SAM
     Set your dreams high, Lucy.

Lucy looks at her father lovingly.

          LUCY
     I'm sorry, Daddy.  It was all my fault.

          SAM
     No, Lucy.  Don't say that.

          LUCY
     I wouldn't want any Daddy but you.

She looks around to see if anybody's writing.  NOBODY IS. 
She suddenly screams at them:

          LUCY (CONT'D)
     I said I was sorry!  I said I didn't
     want any Daddy but him!  Why don't you
     write that down?!

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

We hear sobbing and see Rita sitting across from a very rich,
very angry COUPLE.  Rita's foot is twitching furiously.

          RITA
     ...are you telling me that neither of
     you want custody of your child?

          WOMAN
     He's created a monster.  He's exactly
     like him.  He...he...

The woman is distracted by a loud thumping on Rita's glass
wall - it's SAM.  Holding an envelope.  Very distressed, as
the Secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby.

          RITA
     I am right here with you, excuse me.
               (she unlocks door)
     Sam?  Didn't I tell you that you have to
     call?

          SAM
     I -

          RITA
     You know how to make an appointment.

          SAM
     It's -

          RITA
     That's ridiculous you can always get
     Patricia.

          SAM
     They -

          RITA
     Good.  I'll see you next week.

          SAM
     But it's an emergency - lots of three
     syllable words urgent open at once.

He hands the letter to Rita.  Rita looks through the glass
wall at her clients who are getting impatient.

          RITA
     They want to have you and Lucy evaluated
     by a shrink.  The appointment is today
     at three.  Today.  Now.  Today!

          SAM
     I know and I want you to object.

          RITA
     Sam I can't object.  It's court ordered.

Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying.  He
walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket.

          SAM
     Here.  Don't be sad.

She looks at him as if he's from Mars.  Rita, now outside her
office, watches Sam now inside the office.

          RITA
     Patricia, I'm in the middle - get him
     out of there -

She quickly gets up but Rita's too impatient and pushes past
her into the office.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Sam.  Sam come with me.
               (to the Couple)
     We're gonna get through this excuse
     us...
               (to Sam)
     Sam this is their turn now.  Not yours. 
     Theirs.  If you leave now you'll never
     make it and you have to make it.

          SAM
     Okay okay I know I take the #34 bus and
     transfer to the #13...than the Downtown
     Express to Wilshire then -

Rita looks at the Couple leaving her office.

INT. RITA'S PORSCHE - DAY

Redefining road rage, Rita's slamming the horn.  Sam next to
her.

          RITA
     Go! Go! GO! for chrissakes!  Green means
     GO!

          SAM
     Red means stop yellow in the middle
     means no no no...I don't like shrinks. 
     I've seen too many shrinks.

          RITA
     Yeah.  You and me both.  Right or left
     which will it be you IDIOT!?

          SAM
     Your mother sent you to shrinks, too?

          RITA
     No.  Well, sort of.  I talk about her
     the whole time I'm there.

          SAM
     That's nice.  Did you notice that
     everyone else is driving slower.  I
     noticed that did you?

          RITA
               (on the horn)
     Go for Chrissakes!  How about your
     mother?  Maybe she can help you -

          SAM
     She's gone.  She's at the Park Lane
     Mortuary.  Two from the left.  Under the
     big tree.

          RITA
     Oh.  I'm sorry.  The light is green! 
     WOULD YOU MOVE MOVE MOVE!?

She cuts around the car in front of her; flips him off, and
in a split second that her head is turned, almost SMASHES
into the car in front of her!  She slams on the brakes.

          SAM
     Too many shrinks...I'm sorry Mrs.
     Dawson, if I were you I wouldn't waste
     any more time.  I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson it
     must be a tremendous disappointment. 
     I'm sorry Mrs. Dawson I think you'd both
     be happier if Sam was in a home.

Rita looks over at Sam, forced to stop.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY

Sam sits across from a shrink, MS. GELLER, nervously
straightening her desk.

          PSYCHOLOGIST
     Mr. Dawson, you do understand, that
     since I am a court appointed
     psychologist, the traditional client
     therapist confidentiality will be
     waived.
               (Sam looks confused)
     Mr. Dawson, do you understand that the
     confidentiality will be waived?

Sam nods nervously and waves.  With that she begins.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sam, Ifty, Brad and Robert hover over a used answering
machine.  Ifty pours over the instructions.

          IFTY
     Before you read your message press the
     red button for record, when you finish,
     press the yellow button.  If you press
     the green button, it will play it back
     you.  Let's start with the "ogm".

          SAM
     Okay, okay.  I'm ready.  Hello, I am
     Sam.

          IFTY
     No, no.  I didn't press the red button.

          SAM
     Oh, yes.  False start, false start.

          IFTY
     It's not working.  That's what you get
     for buying a used machine.  Used means
     broken.  You're asking for other
     people's problems, you have enough of
     your own, not that everyone doesn't have
     problems.

          BRAD
     It's not used.  It's pre-owned.  Guy
     bought it for his auto shop and then he
     got a secretary.

          IFTY
     Testing, one two three.

          SAM
     That's a good code.  I'll remember that. 
     One, two, three.

          IFTY
               (pressing button)
     Quick, you're recording.

          SAM
     I'm hi.  I am Sam.  I'm not home.

          ROBERT
     No, you don't want to say that.  you
     don't want them to know you're not home.

          SAM
     But then I'm lying.

          ROBERT
     Everybody's lying.

          SAM
     I'm not a liar.  It will send a mixed
     message to Lucy.

          IFTY
               (pressing the button)
     You're on the air!

          SAM
     Let me see, let me see, let me see.  Hi,
     how are you?

BEEP! the tape runs out.

          IFTY
     That was pretty good.  That was natural.

          SAM
     Did I sound like a good father?

          IFTY
     It's the outgoing message.  You need to
     sound more outgoing.  Let's start again.

INT. GROUP HOME - NIGHT

Mrs. Kerry unlocks the phone and dials.  She hands the phone
to Lucy who waits eagerly in her pj's.  Sam's answering
machine clicks on; as if on slow speed.

          ANSWERING MACHINE
     Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop.  We'd
     love to show you our body work, but it's
     invisible.  Leave it at the beep.

          LUCY
     Try again.  You must have dialed the
     wrong number.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

Rita and Sam walk through the lobby at Rita's Olympic pace. 
She passes the elevator and heads for the stairs.

          RITA
     Look, we've got a lot to go over and
     I've got five minutes.

          SAM
               (pointing to elevator)
     Rubel Bly Harrison and Williams thirty
     second floor, thirty-two floors up.

Rita heads up the stairs.  We hear a BEEP.  Then another. 
Rita checks her heart rate watch.  Starts walking up the
stairs.

          RITA
     One-twenty.  Gotta get to one-twenty
     five to make it count.  Okay okay okay. 
     I'm gonna need that list of people who
     can testify that you're a good father
     despite your handicap.  I didn't mean
     your handicap I meant your disability -
     I mean the fact that you're retarded. 
     That's not the right word.  I mean...
     What do I call you?

          SAM
     Sam.  I am Sam.

Rita looks at Sam as she bounds up the fourth floor.

          RITA
     Yes you are.
               (he hands her a list - her CELL
                PHONE RINGS)
     Hello Ted how you doing/  Whattaya mean
     what's that supposed to mean? 
               (her heart beep rate goes up)
     Put Danny on... You're supposed to be
     taking him to karate.  No it is not my
     day it's your day.  I took your day last
     Wednesday - are you eating no I will not
     hold.  Go pick him up!  What?  I can't
     hear you I'm in the car - they put you
     through to me here...I'm losing you --
               (clicks off phone)
     I get paid for this memory - I know I
     took him last.

A look of horror falls across her face.  She does a 180 and
starts RUNNING down the stairs reading the list.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     We're making progress.  Three character
     witnesses.  That's a good start.  What
     does Ifty Bhutto do?

          SAM
     He works in a bank.

          RITA
               (tripping down the stairs)
     Excellent.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - THE VERY NEXT DAY

Ifty sits across from Rita who attempts to take notes.

          IFTY
     Sam is a very concerned father.  He
     always saves his money at Bank of
     America.  Last year there was a lion on
     the calendar.  This year a gazelle.  The
     gazelle is national bird of Tunisia.  We
     have clients, not customers.  At Bank of
     America.  Bank on us.

He looks up at her, lost.  So is she.

          IFTY (CONT'D)
     What was the question again, please?

                               CUT TO:

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

ON BRAD

Who sits across from Rita.  She tape records him.

          BRAD
     He always made a point of feeding her
     breakfast when "Bewitched" was on and
     lunch when "Jeopardy" was on so she'd be
     smart.  Is that Wonderbra you're
     wearing?  Because you look wonderful.

                               CUT TO:

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

Robert sits across from Rita, who records him.

          RITA
     How long have you and Sam - 

          ROBERT
     Why are you recording this?  Who's
     listening?

          RITA
     It's often necessary -

          ROBERT
     Who are you really?

          RITA
     I'm -

          ROBERT
     What's that supposed to mean?

          RITA
     Let's -

          ROBERT
     I need to talk to my lawyer.

                               CUT TO:

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - LATER

Rita maniacally picks the frosting off a donut.

          RITA
     Patricia, get Mr. Dawson on the line.

Over her INTERCOM, we hear SAM'S ANSWERING MACHINE.

          ANSWERING MACHINE (O.S.)
     Hi, it's Len's Auto Body Shop -

          RITA
     I need this like a - call him at
     Starbucks - no I don't know which
     Starbucks.  There's forty two between
     here and the end of the block.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Rita stands next to her Porsche.  There are Starbucks in
every direction she looks.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

Sam is straightening Sweet and Lows.  Rita barrels in.

          RITA
     Look I don't think you understand what
     you're up against we have to be in court
     in three days and we don't have a decent
     witness.  Now you've gotta know someone
     who can testify who's been to college -
     or has a degree of some kind - or some
     sort of way of expressing themselves
     that's gonna make the court believe that
     you deserve to get your daughter back I
     need a coffee.  Big.  Tall.

          SAM
     Tall's the smallest.

          RITA
     Of course.  Of course, whatever.  Okay
     okay okay.  Damn!  I forgot to call back
     no I did and once you think of this
     person and there has to be one person -
     I want you to call me at work - because
     I'm going back there now to my seven
     other cases --
               (her cellphone RINGS)
     What?  Mrs. Robeck?  I'm on my way, the
     traffic's horrible on the 405.  Dorothy,
     we put in five months lets not let a
     three car pile up..I know it's been
     enormously stressful.. Your Esczema? 
     Oh, honey, nobody notices..AH!  They
     opened a lane!

          SAM
               (too loudly)
     Do you want it here or to go?

          RITA
               (dial tone)
     Dorothy?  Dorothy?  No no no I didn't
     stare at the eczema for five months for -

She takes out her car beeper, clicks it towards the window
and realizes that they're towing her car!

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Sonuvabitch!

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Annie is at the piano, lost in a Beethoven concerto.

          SAM
     Annie, it's one day.  One hour.  Maybe
     only 53 minutes.  Lucy needs you.
               (Annie keeps playing)
     You went to college.  You can give the
     right answers.

Annie plays even harder.  Frustrated, he POUNDS the piano.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     We can't lose her.

          ANNIE
     I can't.  I'd make it worse for you.  I
     can't do it.  Don't you think I would if
     I could?

                               CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

We HEAR A VOICE:

          VOICE (O.S.)
     All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip
     McNeily.

Sam stands along with others in the courtroom.  The Judge
enters and sits.  Everyone else sits now, too.  Except Sam. 
Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down.  Now we
see:

Ifty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's MOTHER, who sits several
seats behind Brad knitting.  Robert holds up a handmade sign
from the back of the courtroom "Free Lucy Dawson".

INT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER

Turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness. 
He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you. 
This man is razor-sharp.  The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam is
on the stand.  Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the
desk he sits at with Rita.  Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE
of the drawing Lucy made in school.

          THERAPIST
     ...there is an unhealthy reversal of
     roles here. 
     As you can see from her drawings, she
     has an exaggerated sense of
     responsibility.  Lucy feels she has to
     take care of her father.  Although at
     her birthday party her true feelings
     about her father were revealed.

          RITA
     Objection.  "True feelings revealed"?!

          TURNER
     The state is paying Miss Geller for her
     opinions -

          RITA
     Then every child who rages because they
     didn't get to stay up for that extra
     hour of TV -

          TURNER
     Objection your honor -

Sam TUGS at Rita's sleeve.  She ignores it.

          RITA
     ...in fact any child who said they hated
     their parents because they didn't want
     to take a bath would be a prime
     candidate for Foster Care.

          TURNER
     Objection.

          SAM
     I think they want you to stop.

          RITA
     Really?!  Thank you, Sam.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     We all appreciate your assistance Mr.
     Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr.
     Turner.

          TURNER
     Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy
     session, Mr. Dawson extolled his
     parenting abilities.

          THERAPIST
     On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he
     felt profoundly inadequate - that he was
     terrified he'd made and would continue
     to make - and I quote: "Huge mistakes,
     huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge."

          TURNER
     No further questions.

Rita starts to scribble notes furiously.  So does Sam. 
Turner smugly sits down.  Rita confidently strides toward the
witness.

          RITA
     You're a mother, aren't you Ms. Geller?

          THERAPIST
     Yes.

          RITA
     Would it be fair to say that as a
     parent, you've felt confused from time
     to time, possibly overwhelmed on
     occasion, even though you're a wonderful
     mother?

          TURNER
     Objection.  It's Mr. Dawson's parenting. 
     Not Ms. Geller's that's at question
     here.

          RITA
     But if Ms. Geller has never had a moment
     where she felt confused as a mother it
     would bias her opinion.  And it is her
     expert opinion we're all after, isn't
     it, Mr. Turner?

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Overruled.  I'll allow it.

          RITA
     Thank you, your Honor.  Ms. Geller, I
     know there have been many moments as a
     parent where I've felt I've made huge
     mistakes - mistakes that are huge.  And
     I've had to admit them to myself.  My
     husband.  But most importantly, to my
     therapist.  Which is the guise Mr.
     Dawson thought he was seeing you under,
     isn't that right, Ms. Geller?

          TURNER
     Objection.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Get to the point, Ms. Harrison.

          RITA
     The point is you've never had those
     moments, have you Ms. Geller?  Moments
     that every parent I've ever spoken to
     has - moments when you've felt the task
     is so unbelievably challenging that you
     feel retarded, disabled in some way. 
     Moments when you feel everyone has the
     key but you.  But you've never had those
     moments, have you Ms. Geller?

          THERAPIST
     I -

          RITA
     Yes or no?

          THERAPIST
     I - 

          RITA
     Let me rephrase the question.  When your
     son od'ed -

          TURNER
     Objection!

          RITA
     But if Ms. Geller didn't feel she had
     made mistakes - mistakes that were huge
     it might bias her opinion toward Mr.
     Dawson.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     I will -

          RITA
     Thank you.  So Ms. Geller - yes or no -
     when your son od'ed, did you feel you
     might have made mistakes, mistakes that
     were huge?

          THERAPIST
               (tearfully)
     Yes.

INT. COURTROOM CAFETERIA - DAY

Sam and Rita go down the cafeteria line.

          SAM
     You made her cry.

          RITA
     You got lucky.

          SAM
     That's not nice.  Not very nice.

          RITA
     Only in there.

          SAM
     Your secretary too.  Yellow and green in
     one bowl.
               (Sam stares at a bowl of Lima
                beans and corn)
     You separate the Lima beans from the
     corn please?

The CAFETERIA WORKER stares at him.  Yeah.  Sure he will.

          RITA
     Sam, don't be impossible.
               (then to Worker)
     Can I have the spinach omelet - only egg
     whites no fat no oil no butter and extra
     mushrooms.

          CAFETERIA WORKER
     Absolutely.

Sam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into
separate piles.  They arrive at the cashier.  Rita pulls out
her billfold.  Sam reaches for his wallet.

          SAM
     My treat.  My treat.

          RITA
     Don't be ridiculous.  I'll get it.

          SAM
     I said it's my treat.  That means I'll
     get it.

          RITA
     Sam, do you really want to get it or are
     you just trying to --

          SAM
     Trying to what?

          RITA
     You know, trying to act like a -

          SAM
     Like a what?

          RITA
     Like a...a...

          SAM
     A real man?

          RITA
     I didn't say that.

          SAM
     You're my lawyer and you think what they
     think.  I don't have a chance.  No
     chance at all.  Even with an expert
     witness.

Rita looks at him.  He's right.  She chooses her words
carefully.

          RITA
     I think...you deserve...a fair trial.

          SAM
     Answer the question.

          RITA
     Okay okay okay.  What was the question
     again?

          SAM
     Do you think what they think?  Sam can't
     order food.  Sam can't pay a check.  Sam
     can't take care of Lucy?

          RITA
     It doesn't matter what I think - it
     matters that we win.

          SAM
     You're my lawyer it matters what you
     think.

          RITA
     Hey, it doesn't matter to them what I
     think.

          SAM
     Me.  It matters to me.

He reaches for the receipt, and faces the CASHIER defiantly.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Fourteen thirty three.  That's 5 ones, 2
     quarters and 16 cents less than twenty.

He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away. 
Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of
admiration.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

DR. DONOVAN, an attractive soft-spoken woman is on the stand. 
Rita is working the room.  Sam, having a hard time
concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the
ceiling.

          RITA
     Dr. Donovan, the American Medical
     Journal named you one of the country's
     leading oncologists.  Isn't that
     correct?

          DR. DONOVAN
     Yes.

          RITA
     What kept you going the twelve years you
     were in medical school?

          DR. DONOVAN
     Caffeine.  Sugar.  And my mother's
     confidence in me.

          RITA
     I wish I had a mother like that.  She
     must have been smart.

          DR. DONOVAN
     She had great instincts.

          RITA
     Do you have any idea what her IQ was?

          DR. DONOVAN
     In the lower ranges.  About eighty.

          RITA
     So your mother, this woman with the IQ
     of a nine-year old had the wisdom to
     recognize that you would be a great
     doctor.  I guess her disability didn't
     seem to hold you back in life.

          DR. DONOVAN
     No.  My mother's condition taught me
     what they can't teach you; compassion
     and patience.

          RITA
     Traits most doctors have in spades. 
     Thank you, no further questions.

Sam runs to hug Dr. Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him
down.

          TURNER
     How'd you get through medical school? 
     Where'd you live?

          DR. DONOVAN
     We lived with my mother's parents.

          TURNER
     Oh, Grandma and Grandpa.  Would it be
     fair to say your grandparents were of
     normal intelligence?

          DR. DONOVAN
     Yes.

          TURNER
     And didn't these people - your
     grandparents - with normal intelligence -
     have the real responsibilities?

          RITA
               (relishing this)
     Objection!  I hear Mr. Turner's mother
     in-law lives with him!  She must help
     out.  Does that mean he doesn't have the
     real -

          TURNER
     Motion to strike that from the record. 
     Irrelevant, immaterial and immature -

          RITA
     Irrelevant?!  Any parent has a right to
     a support system.

          TURNER
     I'm not talking about the rights of the
     parent, I'm talking about the rights of
     a child.
               (the gavel bangs)
     I'm talking about entrusting an eight
     year old's welfare in the hands of
     someone whose records show he was
     diagnosed with infantile autism, mental
     retardation...

          RITA
     Objection!  Motion to strike that from
     the record.  It's clear that one's
     intellectual capacity has no bearing on
     their ability to love.  You Honor, would
     you please instruct council to proceed
     with a modicum of sensitivity?

          TURNER
     Oh, I'm sensitive.  I'm real sensitive
     when I see people like you --
               (the gavel BANGS!)
     come here and try to give meaning to
     your life by screwing up somebody
     else's!

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     That's enough.  Both lawyers approach
     the bench!

          RITA
               (both approach)
     And I suppose tearing apart a family is
     truly noble work, Mr. Turner.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     That's it.  I fine you both for
     contempt.  Two-hundred fifty dollars.

          TURNER
     What's that to her?  She gets that for
     picking up the phone.

          RITA
     Oh, that's what this is about.

          TURNER
     I'll tell you what this is about.  See
     this is an award for you at some
     luncheon.  But I'm here everyday.
               (gavel POUNDS AGAIN)
     You win, you're out the door. 
     But guess who I see come back?  The kid. 
     Most of the time, in less than a year. 
     Only now it's too late.  So you're
     right.  I'm real sensitive.  You can't
     even touch that area.

ON SAM

Devastated.

                               CUT TO:

INT. INSTITUTIONAL GRAY SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY

Margaret Brown observes Sam and Lucy.

          LUCY
     But how did he prove it?

          SAM
     Columbus had to sail around the world to
     prove it was round.

          LUCY
     You're so smart, Daddy.

Sam shoots a look at Margaret.  He hasn't heard anything nice
about himself in so long.  Lucy looks into her father's eyes.

          LUCY (CONT'D)
     Are we winning, Daddy?

Sam shoots ANOTHER look.  He doesn't want to lie.  Lucy
catches the look between Sam and Margaret.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Excuse me, time's up.

          LUCY
     Please.  Just a little more.

          MARGARET BROWN
     I have another client at two-thirty. 
     You need to put your shoes on and get
     ready to go.

          LUCY
     Oh no!  There's a knot.  A really big
     knot.

Sam attempts to undo it.  Lucy and he work very slowly,
cherishing each moment together.

          MARGARET BROWN
     I'll help you.

She undoes it quickly.  Hands it back.

          LUCY
     I need to go to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lucy's feet dangle from under the stall.  Margaret's sturdy
shoes from under another.  Suddenly, Lucy's head pops out and
now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall, tip toes
across the room and out the door.  Locking it with a key.

INT. SOCIAL WORKERS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lucy runs up to her father.

          LUCY
     Daddy, she said we could go to the park.

          SAM
     What's going on?  What made her change
     her mind?

          LUCY
     I started crying in the bathroom.  She
     thought we needed more time.

          SAM
     That was so nice of her.  Very nice.

INT. BUS - DAY

Sam and Lucy hold hands and look out the window.  Sam sees
Echo Park approaching and gets up.  Lucy pulls him back to
the seat.  She looks Daddy in the eye and in a furtive
whisper:

          LUCY
     Let's not get off.  Let's keep going.

          SAM
     No, Lucy.

          LUCY
     Please.

          SAM
     That would be wrong.

          LUCY
     Tamara's Mommy lost her case and Tamara
     hasn't seen her in six years.  She's had
     five different mommies and one of them
     hit her.

          SAM
     I won't let that happen.

          LUCY
     That's what her real mommy said.  And
     now they won't even let her talk to her.

Sam reels with confusion.  Lucy buries herself in his chest.

          LUCY (CONT'D)
     Daddy, it's the only way to be together. 
     We'll start a new life, get new names. 
     We'll live in a new apartment.  They'll
     never find us.

The bus has stopped.  Passengers for the park have exited. 
Sam doesn't move.  As the BUSDRIVER closes the door and heads
on, he holds Lucy protectively to his chest.

          SAM
     I love you Lucy.  I love you.

          LUCY
     My name isn't Lucy anymore, it's
     Michelle.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Lucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he
gazes out at the passing highway, far from home.  We hear the
song "Michelle".

EXT. PARK - 4 A.M.

Sam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic
tunnels and jungle gym.  A flashlight shines in Sam's face.

          COP
     Hey, buddy.  No loitering.  Move it.

          SAM
     Not yet not yet not yet.

          COP
     You want me to get a black and white
     down here?

He moves toward Sam.  SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on. 
The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the
middle of the park and getting totally wet.

          SAM
     Not yet not yet not yet.

He shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see INSIDE THE
PLASTIC TUNNEL where LUCY SLEEPS PEACEFULLY on a bed of
coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal.

          COP
     Jesus Christ.

          SAM
     She hasn't been sleeping well.  She
     needs a good night's rest.  Let her
     sleep, let her sleep.
               (the cop moves toward Sam)
     NO!

          COP
     What are you, crazy?

All the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles
in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic
tunnel.

                                    SMASH CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - DAWN

Police doors swing open as Rita, coat over pj's, a sleepy
DANNY by her side, storm inside.  Lucy lies on a bench with
her head in Sam's lap.

          RITA
     What were you thinking what were you
     possibly thinking?!

          SAM
     I -

          RITA
     That's ridiculous!  Danny stay with me -
               (he moves away)
     What could you possibly gain by
     kidnapping your kid in the middle of a
     custody hearing?!

          SAM
     She -

          RITA
     I don't wanna hear it!  Can you possibly
     explain this to me?!

          SAM
     But Lucy said -

          RITA
     Who's the parent here?  Who's the
     goddamned parent here?  Danny!  Stay in
     the hallway -

Danny turns the corner just as Margaret Brown rushes in. 
Rita turns to her - her expression changes on a dime.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Miss Brown, I can imagine what you're
     thinking.

          MARGARET BROWN
     I'm -

          RITA
     But I ask you what parent in their right
     mind seeing their child in pain --

          MARGARET BROWN
     I have seen -

          RITA
     Their yearning for contact - wouldn't
     take them in an attempt to comfort them? 
     Where the hell is Danny?

          MARGARET BROWN
     You - 

          RITA
     He - 

          MARGARET BROWN
     There's - 

          RITA
     Oh yes there is!  And if I were you I'd
     look at my conscience you do have one
     don't you long and hard before I tried
     to use this in court.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Is that a threat?

          RITA
     No.  It's a plea.  Give'm a break. 
     Give'm one goddman break.

Margaret's cell phone RINGS.

          MARGARET BROWN
     What?!  No, Mrs. Sloan.  His temperature
     couldn't be 117, no not even 107.  Okay,
     okay, I'll come...Come on Lucy, I'll
     take you back.

          RITA
     C'mon, Danny.  We're going home. 
     Danny!?  Danny!?!?

The FIRE ALARM GOES OFF and --

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Goddamn it, Danny!

Rita avoids Margaret's look.  Margaret's cell phone goes off
again.  She doesn't answer.  Now Rita looks at Margaret, but
this time Margaret avoids looking at her.  Lucy runs to Rita
and throws her arms around her waist.

          LUCY
     Please don't fire us.  It was all my
     idea.  Please don't.  Please.  Please.

Rita is disarmed.  She's moved and not used to being moved.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          BAILIFF
     ...the whole truth, and nothing but the
     truth, so help you God?

Lucy's in her best dress, being sworn in.  One hand in the
air.

          LUCY
     So help me God...

And now CAMERA MOVES AROUND HER AND WE SEE THAT SHE'S HIDING
HER OTHER HAND BEHIND HER BACK - FINGERS CROSSED.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Lucy is on the stand, Turner is cross-examining her.

          TURNER
     I heard you turned seven this year. 
     That's pretty exciting.

          LUCY
     Everybody gets older.  It's not that big
     a deal.

          TURNER
     What'd you get for your birthday?

          LUCY
     I haven't opened my presents yet.

          TURNER
     Really?  That's odd.  Why not?

Lucy looks to her father and Rita.

          LUCY
     I opened my presents.  I got the HELP
     album - limited edition.

ON RITA AND SAM

What is she doing?

          TURNER
     Oh, I'm sorry.  I was confused.  I
     thought you didn't open your birthday
     presents because you ran away from your
     own party when your best friend told
     everyone that you were adopted.

          LUCY
     I never said that; why would I say that?

          TURNER
     Why would your friends say it if you
     hadn't said it?

          LUCY
     Kids lie all the time.

Next to her skirt, we see her fingers are crossed so hard
they're practically turning purple.

          TURNER
     May I remind you Lucy that you're under
     oath?

          LUCY
     You may.

          TURNER
     And do you know that means if you lie
     you could be in serious trouble?

          LUCY
     I do.

          TURNER
     So now that you and I have agreed to
     tell the truth, where did you sleep last
     night?

Rita glares at Margaret.  Thanks a lot.

          LUCY
     In my bed at the Foster home.

          TURNER
     All right, Lucy.  If you're not going to
     tell the truth, I am.  Your dad
     kidnapped you last night and the police
     found you sleeping in a seedy park a
     hundred miles from here.  You're lying
     right now because you're afraid.  Afraid
     that everyone will see how scared and
     frustrated you really are.  You're
     afraid of hurting him, but now we need
     to tell the truth.  The truth is deep
     inside you know you're not getting what
     you need from your father.  Isn't that
     right, Lucy?

A LONG SILENCE.  She stares at Turner defiantly.

          LUCY
     "All you need is love."

INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - DAY

WE HEAR THAT SONG as Sam and Rita walk out of the courtroom. 
Rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in
her purse.  They see Lucy running down the corridor toward
Sam, Margaret Brown behind her.

          LUCY
     Daddy!  I did great, didn't I?

          SAM
     No, Lucy, you lied.

          LUCY
     Shhh!  Don't tell anyone.

Rita watches Sam.  Moved by his concern as a parent.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Lucy, Mrs. Kerry's here to take you
     back.

          LUCY
     I thought you'd be proud of me.  Jo Jo's
     mom told him to lie on the stand and say
     he never saw a needle in the house; and
     he did, and now they're back together.

          SAM
     Jo Jo isn't us.  The truth, the truth,
     when the judge hears the truth, he'll
     know, he'll know we should be together.

          LUCY
               (bursting)
     Nobody's interested in the truth, Daddy. 
     Nobody cares!

They lead her down the hallway toward Mrs. Kerry - Sam's
voice gets louder and louder - determined to make her hear.

          SAM
     I CARE!  DO YOU HEAR ME?  THE TRUTH. 
     THE WHOLE TRUTH!  SO HELP ME GOD!!

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The darkness of Sam's apartment.  We see him on his knees. 
Saying his prayers by his bedside.

          SAM
     Help me, God.  Help me, God.  Help me,
     God...

We see ANNIE'S SILHOUETTE from the window of her apartment as
it moves across the frame.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Turner cross examines George, the manager of Starbucks.

          GEORGE
     Sam's my most reliable employee.  He's
     never missed a day of work in eight
     years.  Always warm, always friendly.

          TURNER
     Admirable qualities for a single father. 
     Mr. Walker, in these eight years, have
     Mr. Dawson's responsibilities,
     which...let me see...would include
     bussing tables, replenishing Sweet 'n
     Lows, and sweeping up the place...
     increased?

          GEORGE
     No.  Not really.

          TURNER
     And isn't that because he's mentally
     incapable of learning management skills
     or working the cash register or even
     making a cup of coffee?

          RITA
     Objection.  Leading the witness.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     You may answer the question.

George searches for a way to tell the truth.

          GEORGE
     Well as a matter of fact, Sam and I have
     been discussing a promotion that I was
     planning on putting into effect at the
     end of the week.

Sam leaps to his feet.

          SAM
     Oh boy!  Thank you, George!

Rita pulls him down.  Turner seizes the moment.

          TURNER
     Yes.  Thank you, George.  Now, after
     eight years, Sam can finally measure out
     a teaspoon of coffee and cup of water. 
     Now, he must certainly be able to help
     Lucy with her geometry.

          RITA
     Objection -

          TURNER
     No further questions.

INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER

Rita prepares Ifty.

          RITA
     ...and when I ask another question?

          IFTY
     I answer in one sentence.

          RITA
     Yes.  Short and sweet.

          IFTY
     Yes.  One sentence.  Short and sweet. 
     My aunt was short and sweet.  But her
     cooking was too spicy she...

Rita's twitching foot knocks over her purse.  Out spill
several Snickers Bars with the chocolate picked off them. 
Embarrassed, she kneels to pick them up when she and Sam see
something that stops them both, awestruck.  In the corner of
the corridor, huddled on a bench in dark sunglasses, sits
ANNIE IN A PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS SUIT.  Sam runs to her.

          SAM
     Annie!  I can't believe it!

          ANNIE
               (visibly trembling)
     Tell them to take me quickly.

          RITA
     Give me one minute with the judge.

INT. COURTROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Annie, wearing her dark glasses, is being questioned by Rita.

          RITA
     Besides being Lucy's godmother, aren't
     you also Lucy's piano teacher?

          ANNIE
     Yes.

          RITA
     Lucy's very lucky.  Didn't you graduate
     Magna Cum Laud from the Julliard School
     of Music?

          ANNIE
     Summa Cum Laud.

          RITA
               (delighted)
     Excuse me.  Now Ms. Cassell, in all the
     time you've known them, have you ever
     questioned Sam's ability as a father?

          ANNIE
     Never.

          RITA
     Never?

          ANNIE
     Never.  Look at Lucy.  She's strong,
     she's able to display true empathy for
     people, all kinds of people.  I know you
     all think she's as bright as she is
     despite him.  But it's because of him.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Turner stands where Rita did.

          TURNER
     Can Sam add?

          ANNIE
     Yes.

          TURNER
     How about multiplication?

          ANNIE
     He's learning.

          TURNER
     So what you're saying is that Sam can
     not even multiply two times two?  

          ANNIE
     I don't know about you, Mr. Turner, but
     my fondest memories of my parents have
     nothing to do with times tables or state
     capitals.

          TURNER
     I bet he's knocking on your door all the
     time with questions.

          ANNIE
     Yes.  All the time.  The last question
     was whether to use Biz or Clorox to get
     the grass stains out of Lucy's soccer
     uniform.

ON RITA AND SAM

This is too good to be true.

          TURNER
     So let's see..he doesn't know math...he
     can't even wash her clothes.  How about
     puberty?  I can only imagine how much
     insight he'll bring to approaching the
     sensitive issues of a young girl's
     development.

          ANNIE
     Mr. Turner, show me a father, any
     father, who knows how to do that and
     I'll give them the Parent of the Year
     award.

          TURNER
     And you've had plenty of opportunity to
     observe fathers, haven't you?

          RITA
     Objection!

          TURNER
     But the fact that Ms. Cassell hasn't
     come out of her room in years might have
     some effect on her perception.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     I'll allow it.

          ANNIE
     I had twenty eight years in the world to
     observe all kinds of fathers.

          TURNER
     What about your father, Ms. Cassell? 
     Since you appear to be an expert on
     father-daughter relationships.

A long pause.  Sam watches as Annie visibly tightens.

          TURNER (CONT'D)
     Excuse me, Ms. Cassell, I didn't hear
     your response.  What about your father?

Annie reaches for her water glass.  We see her hand SHAKE. 
It knocks over the glass, shattering it on the floor.

          SAM
     Objection!  No further questions!

          TURNER
     Excuse me, Mr. Dawson?

          SAM
     I said that's enough!  I will not allow
     it!  Overruled!  Overruled!!

Rita doesn't stop him.  The Judge hesitates, incredulous,
then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam.  Annie is curled
into a tight ball in the passenger seat.  Sam is tucked into
the shelf in the back.  His legs kick Rita in the face with
every gear shift.

          RITA
     Thank you again, Annie.  You were truly
     extraordinary.

          SAM
     Extraordinary.  Truly extraordinary.

Annie doesn't move.

          RITA
     Okay okay okay okay.  Well, Sam has his
     big day on the stand tomorrow and we
     need to work a little bit so that he's
     as effective as you were.

          SAM
     Effective.  Very effective.

          RITA
     On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle
     is a little hidden by that thingamajig,
     so if you're having a hard time finding
     it I'll just --

Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS!

          ANNIE
     Noooooooo!

          SAM
     Annie's not quite ready to go outside
     yet.

          RITA
     Okay, we'll just take our time.

INT. PORSCHE - TWO HOURS LATER

It's dark now.  Annie is still catatonic.  Rita's on the car
phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling.

          RITA
     Home!  Home!  HOME GODDAMNIT!  Juanita,
     help Danny with his English assignment. 
     Ayude Danny un story...story...STORIO!

          ANNIE
               (rising from the dead)
     I'm ready now.

          RITA
               (gently)
     Good, fine, Sam?  Annie's ready.

Sam's fallen asleep.

EXT. RITA'S LAVISH BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

Rita and Sam enter.

INT. RITA'S BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

Sam is awestruck at the magnificent home.

          RITA
     Okay okay okay okay.  We'll work in the
     library.  It's down the hall and to the
     left.

They pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of
the wide-screen TV watching MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Hey, Danny.  
               (no answer)
     Where's your father?

          DANNY
               (staring at TV)
     Guess.

          RITA
     I don't want to guess.  Where is he?
               (Sam watches Rita)
     I told you I don't want to guess.

          DANNY
     Well where was he last night?

          RITA
     Working late.

          DANNY
     There you guessed it.

          RITA
     He said he was working late?

          DANNY
     That's what he said.

          RITA
     Well who did he say was taking care of
     you?

          DANNY
     You.  But you said you were working
     late.

          RITA
     I am working late.

          DANNY
     Then go work.

          RITA
     How was your day?

          DANNY
     You have to work.  Go work.

          RITA
     No.  How was your -

Her CELL PHONE goes off.  Rita moves into the hallway to
answer her phone.  Sam moves into the den, sits on the couch,
the sound of Rita arguing with her husband drifts into the
room.  Sam looks sideways at Danny who remains stonefaced.

          SAM
     This is my favorite part.  Hey Dommy,
     this one looks like he's suffering from
     shell shock.

          DANNY
     Boy I guess we can shell it out... It
     was a shell of a good hit.

Rita stands in the doorway watching Sam have a longer
conversation with her son than she's had in months.  She
retreats.

INT. RITA'S DEN - LATER

Danny and Sam eat popcorn watching the movie.

          SAM
               (bellowing)
     "Turtles in the half-shell, turtle
     power!"  Rita!  Come this is the best
     part.

He heads towards Rita.

INT. PANTRY - CONTINUOUS

In the half-light Sam catches a glimpse of Rita standing in
the pantry unconsciously stuffing marshmallows into her
mouth.  Their eyes lock for a moment.

          SAM
     You eat too fast.  Come watch the movie.

          RITA
     It's getting late.  We have to get to
     work.
               (handing him a suit)
     This is my husband's.  He won't notice. 
     He's got ten more just like it.  Try it
     on.

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Sam comes out of the bathroom in the new suit.  Rita stares
at him astonished.  He looks incredibly handsome.  Rita,
attempting to stifle her reaction, turns away from Sam.

          SAM
     Bad?

          RITA
     No.  Very, very good.  But your tie's
     crooked.

Rita stands behind Sam with her around him showing him how to
do his tie properly.  Their images are reflected in the
mirror.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Cross over once.  Loop it around on the
     inside of your neck.
               (her hand grazes his neck)
     Slide the other side through the loop,
     then tighten.

Rita comes around to the front and straightens and tightens
the tie.  They are both nervous.  The room is charged.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Okay okay okay okay.  Our strategy is
     that we're aggressively pursuing a
     support system.  I'm going to ask you h
     ow are you prepared to help Lucy in
     school?

          SAM
     Let me see let me see let me see.

          RITA
     Sam!  I told you you have to stop that! 
     It makes you look stupid!  Okay okay
     okay.  Try again.
               (endless pause)
     You say you will find her a tutor.  Then
     I say, "How will you pay for it?"

          SAM
     Could you slow down?  Why do you eat so
     fast?

          RITA
               (ignoring him)
     We've gone over this a million times. 
     You've found a free tutoring service for
     her at the YMCA.

          SAM
     But I didn't.  You did.

          RITA
     Can't you grasp the concept of
     manipulating the truth?  Not lying. 
     Just a little tweak here and there.

          SAM
     No...You're so lucky.  You get to play
     with Danny all the time.

          RITA
     He doesn't want to play with me.

          SAM
     Yes he does.  He does he does.  He
     thinks you don't want to.

          RITA
     Oh that's ridiculous of course I want
     to.

          SAM
     Tweak, tweak.

          RITA
               (exploding)
     I drove around after work yesterday 'til
     9:30 looking for a goddman razor
     scooter!

          SAM
               (in his own world)
     Tweak, squeak, peek peek...

Rita shifts uneasily, embarrassed by her overreaction.

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - LATER

          RITA
     Okay, why did you harass that young boy
     at your home?

          SAM
     You know I didn't harass him, Rita.  You
     know that, you know that!

          RITA
     Sam, I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner,
     remember?  Okay?

          SAM
     Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.  I didn't harass
     him, Mr. Turner.  Mr. Turner -
               (Sam can't keep a straight
                face)
     You don't look like him.

          RITA
     That's a blessing.

          SAM
     You're so much prettier.

          RITA
               (suddenly shy)
     Thank you.  Now. 
     What makes you think you can take care
     of a woman - I mean a young child - when
     you have a hard time taking care of
     yourself?

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER

Rita is relentless.  Sam is exhausted but determined.

          RITA
     But who are you kidding?  Isn't Lucy
     already smarter than you?

          SAM
     In some ways.  But in other ways, she's
     not, I think.

          RITA
     You think?

          SAM
     I think.

          RITA
     Sam.  You've got to be firm on this.

          SAM
     I think in other ways I'm smarter than
     her.  Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner. 
     In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than
     you, Judge McNeilly.

          RITA
     Whoa!  Bring it down.

          SAM
     What parent doesn't want more for their
     child?  To be more than the sum of the
     parts of the whole of them.

          RITA
     Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a
     little girl to love her daddy when she's
     a baby, but once she loses respect for
     you, what will you do?

          SAM
               (fierce)
     I won't let that happen.  I won't.

          RITA
     How can you say that?

          SAM
     Respect is not just about how smart
     someone is.  Smart is not just about how
     smart someone is.

          RITA
     But what about Lucy?  Aren't you being
     selfish?  Doesn't she deserve a better
     life?  Don't you think she's just
     pretending she's happy to not hurt your
     feelings?  

Sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger.

          SAM
     Lucy is happy!  We have fun!  We go to
     Denny's, we go to video night.  I know
     how to love her.  I know I'm not going
     to able to go to law school and learn
     how to be a mean person, but I know how
     to love.  I know how to be her father,
     Mr. Turner!

By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard,
overcome with emotion.  Rita is unexpectedly near tears. 
Suddenly before she knows it, she is HOLDING SAM.  The room
charged.  She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man.

          RITA
     I know you do, Sam.  I know you do.

INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING

Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit.

          GEORGE
     You look great, Sam.  What time do you
     have to be in court?

          SAM
     Half day, half day.  I take the stand at
     two.

George leads him behind the counter.  THE STAFF BEAMS. 
Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines.

          GEORGE
     Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non
     fat.

          SAM
     Sprinkles or Cinnamon?

INT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M.

Sam is doing great.  He's humming as he prepares a triple
latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.

INT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M.

The place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS. 
Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the
espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while
glancing up at the clock.  Sam hands three cups to customers,
the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out.

A CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT.

          GUY
     What is this?  I ordered an Americano,
     not a latte.

          SAM
     Americano, Americano, not a latte.

Working as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam
unconsciously drinks the latte.

INT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M.

Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess. 
Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild. 
Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns
it ON.  A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face. 
At that moment, George comes out of his office.

          SAM
     I'm going to be late!  I'm going to be
     late!

          GEORGE
     I'll call a taxi.

          SAM
     No, no, I can't wait.  I can't wait. 
     I've got to go right now.

Sam heads out, the coffee drink still dripping from his face.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street
out of his mind.  Cars are jammed up.  He walks over them, a
man possessed.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Everyone is in their places, waiting.

          TURNER
     Your Honor, if the defendant doesn't
     have enough interest in his daughter to
     even show up -

          RITA
     Your Honor, I'm sure he'll be here any
     moment.  This is an extremely important
     day to Mr. Dawson.

At THAT MOMENT, Sam bursts through the doors.  Suit stained,
hair sticky with frappuccino.  Rita's jaw drops.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Your Honor, may I have a moment with my
     client?

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.

Rita heads towards Sam.  Up close, he looks even worse.  

          RITA
     What the hell happened?
               (sniffing the air)
     What is that smell?  Mint?

Sam, determined, heads for the stand.  Rita grabs Sam's
shoulders and tries to focus him.  Looks deep into his eyes.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Sam, look at me.  Look at me! 
               (he does)
     I will guide you like last night.
               (Sam hugs her)
     Not that part of last night, the other
     part.  Now you can do it.  I know you
     can.  Lucy needs you.

          SAM
               (a mile a minute)
     Lucy needs me.

          RITA
     Yes, slow down because Lucy needs you.

          SAM
     Lucy needs you.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Ms. Harrison.  We need you!

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Sam, on the stand, talks a mile a minute from the coffee.

          RITA
     How will you be able to pay for private
     tutoring?

          SAM
     There's a free program at the YMCA. 
     Lucy can go there.

          RITA
     But don't you ever think it would be
     better for Lucy if she lived with a
     permanent foster family and you could
     visit whenever you wanted?

          SAM
     The Fosters don't know her.  Why can't
     she live with me and they can come visit
     if they want to.  I'm firm on this.  And
     I'm getting firmer.  Lucy belongs with
     me.

          RITA
     Why?

Sam puts his finger to his chin and starts his "Let me
see..." Rita gives him a look; he lowers his finger and
starts talking very fast from the coffee.  The STENOGRAPHER
desperately tries to keep pace.

          SAM
     Paul wrote the first part of the song
     "Michelle".  He said to John, "Where do
     I go from here?"  John had been
     listening to Nina Simone.  There was a
     line in it that went something like, "I
     love you, I love you, I love you..."
     They put that into the song.  It
     wouldn't be the same song without that. 
     It made the song complete.  That's why
     the whole world cried when they broke up
     on April 10, 1970.

ON RITA

Well, he has some kind of point. 

MARY, the Stenographer, is still typing.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Did you get that, Mary?

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Turner fires questions at Sam - a mile a minute.

          TURNER
     When you were Lucy's age, were you
     living at home?

          SAM
     No.

          TURNER
     Were you living with your mother and
     father?

          SAM
     No.

          TURNER
     Well then where were you living?

          SAM
               (very quietly)
     In an institution.

          TURNER
     So your parents put you in an
     institution?

          SAM
     Only after my mom got sick.

          TURNER
     What about your father?  Where was he?

          SAM
     Gone with the wind when Sam was born.

          TURNER
     So, you weren't raised by your mother?

          SAM
     I saw her I saw her.

          TURNER
     When?

          SAM
     Christmas, Easter and my birthday.

          TURNER
     Oh, once a year on your birthday.  So in
     a way, the people at the institution
     were your parents.  Were they nice to
     you?

          SAM
     Some yes.  Some on.  Some yes.

          TURNER
     Did they hit you?

          SAM
     Sometimes.  Sometimes they did
     sometimes.

          TURNER
     Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her
     birthday party?

          RITA
     Objection!  Nobody hit anybody!

          TURNER
     Let me rephrase that, strong-armed.  So
     what role model do you call upon as a
     father when you're parenting Lucy?  The
     head of the institution?  The Principal 
     the warden?

          SAM
     No.  Not Mr. Whitehead.  Not him.

          TURNER
     Then who?

          SAM
     Myself.

          TURNER
     you have the mental capacity of a seven
     year old.  So you ask yourself, a seven
     year old -

          SAM
     I am not a seven-year old.

          TURNER
     How to parent a fellow seven-year old?

          SAM
     Yes.  No.  What was the question?

          TURNER
     The question is: what makes you think
     you can be a parent?  Your background? 
     Your IQ?  Your friends who can't even
     testify for you?

          RITA
     Objection -

          SAM
     My friends -

          RITA
     Objection -

          SAM
     My friends love Lucy even if Rita
     thought they weren't smart enough to
     testify.  Even if she said you'd wipe
     the floor with them.

ON RITA

Trying to telepathically reach Sam.

          TURNER
     Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just
     objected; that means you didn't have to
     answer the question.  You can't even
     follow the simple rules you've watched
     here day after day.  You really think
     you can raise a seven-year old?  A ten
     year old?  A thirteen-year old?
               (in his face)
     That means she'll be six years more
     advanced than you.

Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar.  He searches
for words.  Then from the clearest place inside himself:

          SAM
     I've had a lot of time to think about
     whatever it is that makes somebody a
     good parent.  It has to do with
     constancy.  It has to do with patience. 
     It has to do with listening.  To
     pretending to listen when you can't even
     listen anymore.

The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence.  Rita's amazed.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     It has to do with love, like she says...

Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?"

          SAM (CONT'D)
     And I don't know where it's written that
     a woman has a corner on that market,
     that a man has any less of those
     emotions than a woman.  Billy has a home
     with me!  It's not perfect!  I'm not a
     perfect parent!  Sometimes I forget he's
     just a little kid...
               (whispers from the courtroom)
     We built a life together and we love
     each other and if you destroy that, it
     may be irrep, irrep, irrep...

          IFTY
     Irreparable.

All eyes TURN to the back of the room.  Ifty is there trying
with all his might to help his friend.

          IFTY (CONT'D)
     Joanne, don't do that, please.  Don't do
     it twice, not to him.  Then Meryl Streep
     can't even look at Dustin Hoffman after
     that.

          TURNER
     Right, "Kramer vs. Kramer."  Thank you
     for the commentary, Mr. Bhutto.  It's
     hard to find words isn't it, Mr. Dawson. 
     It's confusing.  It's confusing to know
     what to say to Lucy half the time, isn't
     it?

Mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a
loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything
Turner's saying, Sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom. 
Rita, stunned and incredulous; Turner and his associate
smirking at him; Ifty, shaking his head; Robert, his face in
his hands; Miss Wright, Margaret Brown, the State's Expert,
almost willing him to fail.  Are they right?  Are they?

          SAM
     No, yes, no.

          TURNER
     No what?

          SAM
     Let me see let me see let me see.

          TURNER
     You don't know what?

          SAM
     Yes.

          TURNER
     Yes.  You're right, you don't know.  You
     don't know enough to really raise your
     daughter?

          RITA
     Objection.  These aren't questions,
     these are attacks.

          SAM
               (frantic)
     I am Lucy's father.

          TURNER
     Are you?  Are you really?  I'm not
     talking about the fact that you got some
     homeless woman pregnant.

          RITA
     Objection your Honor.  I motion a
     recess.

          JUDGE MCNEILY
     Denied.  Get to the question, Mr.
     Turner.

          TURNER
     The question is if you love your
     daughter as much as they say you do
     don't you think she deserves more?! 
     Don't you?  In your heart of hearts,
     secretly question yourself every day? 
     Don't you?!

          SAM
     Yes.

          TURNER
     Was that a "yes?"

          RITA
     Objection.

          SAM
     Yes.  She does.  She deserves
     everything.  In my heart of hearts.

          TURNER
     Yes she does.  And you agree with
     everyone, you can't give her that?

          SAM
               (in unbearable pain)
     Maybe.  Maybe everybody's right.

ON TURNER

There.  He got it.  

ON RITA

Anguished.  Watching Sam unravel as he stands up and starts
walking around in a circle in the witness box.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     No more no more!  Let it stop!  No more! 
     No more!  No more!

The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned.  The verdict is
obvious.  Sam has passed judgement on himself.

EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY

Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward
Margaret Brown's office.  Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam
both see -

LUCY

Sitting, hopeful on the bench.  She searches Sam's face for
the verdict.  The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she
knows.  She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.

          LUCY
     No Daddy!  No Daddy!  No Daddy!

In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in
the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit.  The
only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the
background.  Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.

          MARGARET BROWN
     C'mon, Lucy.  It's time to say goodbye.

          LUCY
     NOOOO!  Don't let go don't let go don't
     let go -

Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each
other.  With such fierce love; a parent and a child.

          LUCY (CONT'D)
     Don't let them Daddy don't let them! 
     Don't ever let me go!

He can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel
herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done
this.

          MARGARET BROWN
     Please help me.

Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,
shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench
Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she
pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable
pain.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

We hear "Fool on the Hill".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID
melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile
of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY
ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the
record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim. 
Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a
ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over
again against the wall, overcome with grief.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the
doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that
she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy,
when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them
both in, tenderly.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

Saturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in
his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of
flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --

REVERSE ANGLE

Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She
stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock
and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny
chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.

CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY

The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with
her.

          RANDY
     Your teacher told me you were an artist.

          LUCY
     You wear too much perfume.  You're
     trying too hard.

          RANDY
     I am, aren't I.  Maybe you could teach
     me how to paint.

          LUCY
     My daddy's coming today.  We're going to
     open my birthday presents.  Why don't
     you just go do something.

BACK TO SAM

From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything
she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -
feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers
from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then
stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He
stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.

Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her.

BACK ON SAM

Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in
the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And
waits.  And waits.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

It's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans
the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER
marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his
parents.

          MAN
     Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee,
     could you clean this up?

Sam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee.

          MAN (CONT'D)
     I said I need a refill and a towel over
     here.

          SAM
               (snapping)
     You need a towel?  A refill?  A glass of
     water?  You need more than you already
     have?  You have everything -
               (all his fury and frustration)
     Everything.  But it's not enough.  Take
     my daughter, too!

Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he
backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They
CRASH onto the floor.

                                    SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY

Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS
THEM OVER.  Totally out of control.

          LUCY
     You gave him the wrong address!  You're
     hiding me from him!

As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK

Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes
swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the
tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel
and begins to paint.

The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her
face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel
and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and
Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then -

          LUCY
     You're going to send me away now, aren't
     you?

          RANDY
               (tenderly)
     No.

We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song
"Here, There and Everywhere..."

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays
with one finger.  IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS
PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO -

                          INTERCUT:

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to
Sam's sad melody.  Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with
blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures
recede.  By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of
Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself
serenading no one.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the
birthday presents.  TIME HAS PASSED.  They look close, almost
like a mother and daughter.  Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's
present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.

          RANDY
     Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift
     in.

Randy picks up one of Lucy's pictures and moves to the wall.

          RANDY (CONT'D)
     You know, this wall really needs
     something special on it.

Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the
Denny's napkins into an origami bird.  Then crushes it.  Then
cautiously:

          LUCY
     What's the longest any one of those kids
     stayed with you?

          RANDY
     Megan stayed a little over a year.

          LUCY
               (averting her eyes)
     Did you ever want any of them to stay
     longer?

ON RANDY

Moved herself.  Understanding how huge a question this is
coming from this bruised little heart.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER - DAY

Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into
an odd origami pattern.  There's a knock at the door - Sam
doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper.

          RITA (O.S.)
     Sam it's me!  Open up!

He doesn't answer it, just methodically folds.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Rita stands there impatiently.

          RITA
     I don't have time for this!  You were
     supposed to show up for your first
     evaluation.  And I leave work early to
     get there and where the hell are you?! 
     Open the door!  Sam!  Open the goddamn
     door!
               (nothing)
     Alright.  If you don't care enough to
     open the goddamn door I'm outta here! 
     I've ruined my practice, I've alienated
     my colleagues - I sent my kid off on a
     fishing trip with his father so I could
     work with you and you won't open your
     goddman door for me?!  Fine!  THAT'S IT! 
     I've had enough!

She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with
the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door
down.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Rita bursts through the door and then stops.  Sam has created
an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together. 
A fortress against the world.  He keeps folding - doesn't
even look at Rita.  He's more far gone than she could
imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on
it.

          RITA
     Sam, it's Rita.  Can I come in?

          SAM
     No room.  No room.

          RITA
     Hey.  I lived in the East Village.  I
     don't need a lot of room.

          SAM
     Sam makes life too hard.  Sam makes life
     too hard on everyone.

          RITA
     Sam, I can go at least nine more rounds. 
     But you gotta let me in.  Please Sam. 
     Please.

He pulls out one small brick of origami, opening a window.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Thank you.  Now I can see your kind
     eyes...George told me you needed a break
     from work.

          SAM
     I don't want to work there anymore.  Too
     many people.

          RITA
     Maybe we could find you a quieter job. 
     Because remember one of the judges
     conditions is you have to earn more
     money; you've got to keep earning more
     money for when we get you Lucy back.

          SAM
     Lucy doesn't need me anymore.  She has a
     new family.  She doesn't need me
     anymore.

          RITA
     Is that what she said?

          SAM
     She didn't have to say it.  I may be
     stupid, but I know.  I know.

          RITA
     Well that's the first stupid thing I've
     ever heard you say.

Sam looks at her through the window.  A CHINK in the wall.

          RITA (CONT'D)
     Sam, Sam you can get her back.  The
     court favors reunification.  The only
     thing that can block you is if the
     foster family petitions to adopt.  And
     from what I've heard, Lucy's making
     their life miserable - that's our girl. 
     Sam, fight for her.

          SAM
     I tried.  I tried.

          RITA
     Try harder.

          SAM
     You don't know.  You don't know.

          RITA
     I don't know?

          SAM
     You don't know what it is to try and try
     and never get there.  You were born
     perfect, perfect.

          RITA
     Is that right?  Everyone else is perfect
     but only Sam feels loss and pain?

          SAM
     That's right.  People like you don't
     know.

          RITA
     People like me?

          SAM
     People like you don't know, don't know
     what hurt feels like, people like you
     don't feel, don't feel anything.

She slaps him.  STUNNED, he slaps her back.  STUNNED, she
slaps him again.  HE SLAPS HER.  She rips the newspaper wall
down.

          RITA
     You think you got the market cornered on
     human suffering?  Well let me tell you
     something about "People like me." 
     People like me feel little and lost and
     ugly and dispensable.  People like me
     have perfect husbands screwing someone
     far more perfect than me and my son, my
     son hates me, I try too hard and I push
     and he knows it and I talk in that
     voice, that voice I promised I'd never
     use, and I've screamed, I've screamed
     horrible things to him, a five year-old
     because he doesn't want to get in the
     car at the end of a day and he stares at
     me with such anger and I hate him then. 
     I know I'm failing you, I know I'm
     disappointing you, I know you deserve
     better but get in the fucking car!  It's
     like every morning I wake up and fail,
     and I look around and anybody, anybody
     can pull it off, but somehow I can't. 
     And I know, I know I have everything,
     and I'm still miserable and it's
     pathetic.  I know it's pathetic.  No
     matter how hard I try, something about
     me will never be enough.

She's crying too hard to continue.  He pulls her to him. 
Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him
tightly.  He whispers in her ear.

          SAM
     You're enough.  You're so much more than
     enough.

He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the
intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.  And
staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling. 
He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes,
her tears.  And something ignites between them - something
confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate
ache.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Lovely Rita...

On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come
together, whole again.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX
DOGS, all shapes, all sizes.  He heads up the walkway to
Randy's house.  She comes out of the house and shuts the door
behind her, stopping him.

          RANDY
     You're early.

          SAM
     All the lights were green.

          RANDY
     There's a reason for the court schedule. 
     You stopped showing up.  Lucy has had to
     rebuild her life.

          SAM
     I want her back.  I can do it.  I know I
     can.

          RANDY
     That's not up to me, but I'm telling
     you, I will do everything in my power to
     prevent Lucy from getting hurt again.

Sam hangs his head.  A dog barks at Randy.

          RANDY (CONT'D)
     Whose dogs are these?

          SAM
     Supplemental income supplemental income -
     bathe, walk and feed.  Sam Dawson meets
     your canine needs.
               (to dogs)
     Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!

All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB.  Randy heads into the
house.  The front door opens and Lucy comes out.  She runs
down the stares to Sam.  Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her. 
She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent
up fury.

          LUCY
     You never came!  You never even called! 
     You forgot about me!  How could you
     forget me!

          SAM
     I never forgot you.  I forgot me.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     I hate you I hate you I hate you!

Lucy pulls away.  A long charged silence.  Lucy refusing to
even look at her father.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last
     night...

A BASSET HOUND SNEEZES.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Gesundheit, Buster.  Buster has a cold. 
     But the letter had too many big words. 
     Pokey, sit.

The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.  Lucy stares
forward.  Sam speaks tentatively, carefully:

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Dear Lucy.  Pokey sit.  Dear Lucy, I'm
     sorry that I hurt you.  Every moment of
     the day I thought about you.  Lucy in
     the hammock, Lucy at school.  Lucy in
     the sky...XXOO.  Daddy.  P.S. I love
     you, recorded September 11th, the day
     you took your first step.

Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time.

INT. DENNY'S - DAY

ON SALAD BAR

Rows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's
in the peas.  A hand comes into frame and carefully places
the tomato just so, in the tomato bin.  Now it moves to the
olives.  Shouldn't all the pimentos be facing up?

PULL BACK

To reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the
containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their
plates.

          SAM
     Napa cabbage, excellent choice.  Purple
     and green, purple and green.  Very rich
     in Vitamin C.  Good choice. Very good
     choice.

INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam walks toward the courtroom when we see Rita approaching
from the other end of the hall.  They both slow down when
they see each other.  Rita unconsciously fixes her hair.  Sam
adjusts his tie.

          RITA
     Hello, Sam.  Mr. Dawson.  Sam.  Dawson.

          SAM
     Hello, lawyer.

They almost shake hands - realize that means touching each
other and don't.  Rita motions toward the door.

          RITA
     Shall we?

          SAM
     No.  We already did.  Don't tell
     anybody.

They nervously walk through the door, bumping into each
other.

INT. SMALL COURT ROOM - LATER

She's very aware of Sam.  He looks away, over compensating
obviously.  Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her
eyes.  She attempts to put it in place.

          RITA
     Furthermore, my client has found a new
     job, and is making every effort to find
     a bigger apartment so that -

Rita's hair falls in her eyes again.  Sam stands up, pulls
HER BARRETTE from his pocket, the one she left at his house.

          SAM
     Here.

Rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon.

          RITA
     Oh, thank you.  What a...a lovely
     barrette, Mr. Dawson.  It will look
     great on Lucy.  Who I'm sure you bought
     it for.  Furthermore, so that...there
     will be more room for Lucy as she grows
     up.

          MARGARET BROWN
     All of that is well and good but the
     fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job,
     missed his hearing, and did not even
     show up for his visits with his
     daughter...

          RITA
     The fact that my client went through
     profound depression is the most natural
     reaction any parent could have.

          MARGARET BROWN
     But once again he had no idea how his
     behavior during that depression impacted
     on his daughter.

          RITA
     In these next months, Mr. Dawson will be
     expanding his support system to include
     Social Service programs, tutors --

          MARGARET BROWN
     It's too late!  The foster family is
     petitioning the court for sole custody
     of Lucy and I fully support their
     request.

Sam turns to Rita.  This can't be happening.

INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

Sam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth.  With one
extra person, it's a little tight.  Rita picks at her
Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at
hand.

          IFTY
     Isn't it illegal?  It's illegal to go
     through stop signs.  It's illegal to
     cross on the red.

          RITA
     It's not illegal.  It's very
     complicated.  When a strong foster
     parent lobbies for a child it changes
     the equation.

          ROBERT
     They're reaching right through Sam as if
     he doesn't exist.  As if he's a ghost.

          RITA
     There's one option we've never talked
     about, Sam. 
               (very carefully)
     I know what you went through the last
     time you took the stand.  We could
     settle out of court, ask for the most
     incredible visitation rights - it would
     almost seem like joint custody.

          SAM
     You're saying I don't have a chance. 
     That's what you're saying.

          RITA
     I'm not saying you don't have a chance.

          ROBERT
     That's what you said last time and look
     where he is now.

          SAM
     Stop.  Rita's not saying I don't have a
     chance.  Are you?  Tell me I have a
     chance.

Too long a pause.  Ifty looks at the clock.

          IFTY
     Oh my God!  6:35 is Video Night at my
     house and I'm not even there!

          ROBERT
     If we get there before you do we'll wait
     for you - check!

          BRAD
     Sam get your dessert to go.

          SAM
     This is very hard to say.  I'm having my
     dessert here.  With Rita.  I'm not
     coming to video night.

Devastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their
things.

          RITA
     Sam - if you want to go...

          SAM
     I said no, Rita.

          RITA
     I know, but if you -

          SAM
     What?  Do you want me to go?

          RITA
     I didn't say that.  But do you want to
     go?

          SAM
     Where?

          RITA
     Nevermind.

          SAM
     Fine.

          RITA
     Fine.

          IFTY, ROBERT & BRAD
     Fine.

They leave in a huff.  The WAITRESS delivers the check with
dessert and coffee.

          RITA
     I've got it.

          SAM
     I've got it.

Long pause.  Rita slowly eats her pie.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     It's good to chew.  You're eating more
     slowly.

Rita laughs and nods.

          SAM (CONT'D)
     Coconut Rhubarb.  Sidebar, we need to
     talk.  Sidebar.

          RITA
               (carefully)
     Yes we do.

          SAM
     I need to get Lucy back.  We need, we
     need - to be professional.

          RITA
     Do you know what that means?

          SAM
     When dealing with Starbucks' customers,
     be friendly but not familiar.  I can be
     your friend.

          RITA
               (oddly touched)
     Thank you, Sam.

          SAM
     You need to leave your husband.

          RITA
               (her armor up again)
     Oh, my marriage isn't so bad.

          SAM
     'Life is very short and there's no time
     for fussing and fighting, my friend.'

          RITA
               (undone)
     It's just...it's just that...I've never
     lost anything.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.  We
follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS
IN FRONT OF LUCY.  It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.  She looks around -
but doesn't see Sam anywhere.  But she feels him.  She walks
toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up
that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches.  There.  They
made contact.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

It's later that week.  Lucy walks proudly down the street in
a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies.  Randy is by her side,
beaming.

          LUCY
     We've made $22.36.  That's seven
     dollars, 64 cents less than thirty.

          RANDY
     Well that's one way of looking at it.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

DISSOLVE as they move through the neighborhood.  Finally we
see her bound up the steps to an apartment building.  She
knocks on the door.  It opens - and Lucy and Randy's JAW
DROPS. 

REVERSE ANGLE

Sam stands there.  Holding three kittens.  WE see various
dogs in arm chairs, the couch...

          LUCY
     Daddy?!

          RANDY
     What are you doing here?

          SAM
     I live here.  This is where I live.

          LUCY
     This is where you live?  So close to me?

          SAM
     I wanted to be close to you.  I wanted
     to be closer.  Look at my apartment
     number.
               (it's number 9)
     John was born on October 9th.  His son
     was born on October 9th.

          LUCY
     John met Yoko on November 9th.

          SAM
     His mother lived at 9 Newcastle,
     Liverpool.

          LUCY
     Newcastle.  9 letters.  Liverpool - 9
     letters...

          RANDY
     Lucy, give me one minute with your
     father.  Sam, I consider myself an
     understanding person but I don't
     understand this.  You can't close the
     distance between you and Lucy with a new
     address.  We go to court in a week -

          SAM
     I don't want to spend half my visit with
     Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy.  I
     don't want to waste one more minute.

Buster sneezes.

          LUCY
               (from the doorway)
     Does Buster still have his cold?

          SAM
     He's better, much better.  Now I'll have
     one box of mint chocolate cookies.

          LUCY
     That'll be three-eighty six.

          LUCY & SAM
               (in unison)
     Let me see let me see let me see...
     That's one dollar and 14 cents less than
     five.

Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy
effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes
and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.

Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep.  Staring at the
little origami bird on her window sill.  She moves it, opens
the window wide, quickly takes Mr. Jeeters - and within a
moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree.

EXT. MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

"The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a
wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy
in her pj's.  Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm.  Lucy crosses
the street.  HONK!  the screeching of tires...

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly
we make out a figure climbing higher and higher.  It's Lucy. 
We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign
across the street blinks on and off.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sam's asleep.  Suddenly his eyes open wide.  And like an
animal sensing danger, he gets up.  We HEAR THE SOUND of
something THUMPING AGAINST RUNG AFTER RUNG OF THE FIRE
ESCAPE.  He rushes to his window and looks to see --

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT

Lucy climbing the fire escape!  Sam opens the window and
reaches for her.

          SAM
     Lucy Lucy.  What are you doing?!  You
     could have really hurt yourself.  What
     are you doing?

          LUCY
     I couldn't sleep.  Daddy, did you know
     that Warren G. Harding was the twenty
     ninth President of the United States?

          SAM
     No.

          LUCY
     Remember - the twenty-ninth President. 
     In case the Judge asks.

EXT. RANDY'S STREET - NIGHT

Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms.  He
turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  He
knocks on the door.  Finally the door opens and we see Randy
and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.

          SAM
     She couldn't sleep.

          RANDY
     Give me my daugh -
               (she stops herself)
     Give me - I'll take Lucy.

          SAM
     Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three
     times, tell her two stories and give her
     half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a
     third of a glass of milk she'll sleep. 
     Good night.

Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks
purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on
the quiet street.

SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.

EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lucy knocks on Sam's window.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house.

EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.

INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house
looking out the windows, which have now been completely
covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds
from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets
out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly
opening the door.

INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the
stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED
where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear --

          RANDY
               (tenderly)
     Lucy.  Come here.

Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF
MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.

          RANDY (CONT'D)
     I made us a midnight snack.

Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn.

          RANDY (CONT'D)
     I understand that you want to see your
     daddy.  And I don't want to keep you
     from him.  I honestly don't.  So you
     tell me when you want to see him.  You
     can see him anytime you want.  But we
     have to arrange it first.  Do you
     understand?
               (Lucy nods)
     Now would you like a snack?

Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch. 
But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up
the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.

          LUCY
     Thank you.  Goodnight.

          RANDY
               (words caught in her throat)
     Goodnight, Lucy.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a
YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK
at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,
looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.

          RITA
     My husband left this when he moved out.

          SAM
     Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid.

          RITA
               (entering)
     Nice place.  I worry.  I worry
     sometimes...

          SAM
     You worry you did the wrong thing?

          RITA
     I worry that I've gotten more out of
     this relationship than you.

          SAM
     No no no.  I'm the lucky one.  I have
     the lawyer that never loses.

          RITA
               (covering)
     That's me...okay, let me see, let me
     see, let me see.
               (pulls out notes)
     They're going to put Bill and Randy on
     the stand first and then you.

          SAM
     Them first, then me.  They're a nice
     couple.  They have a nice house.  She's
     pretty.  She's smart, too.  I can tell. 
     The manager of the salad bar is gonna
     testify, isn't he?  That will help us.

For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam
overwhelms her.

          RITA
     Absolutely.

          SAM
     Nobody believed that George Harrison
     could really be a song writer.  But he
     wrote "Here Comes the Sun".  John and
     Paul said it was one of the best songs
     on ABBEY ROAD.

          RITA
               (tenderly)
     George was always my favorite Beatle.

          SAM
     Lucy's was Paul.

INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.

Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She
opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.

          LUCY
     Now.

          RANDY
     What honey?

          LUCY
     Now.  I want to see him now.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.

We see Sam sleeping in bed.  There's a KNOCK at the door. 
Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. 
We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door
to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her
arms.

          RANDY
     She fell asleep on the car ride over.  I
     was gonna turn back and tuck her in to
     her bed...with the pink canopy...and the
     quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd
     wake up at our house...
               (fighting the ache in her soul)
     ...and want to come home.

Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.

          RANDY (CONT'D)
     I was gonna tell the judge that I could
     give Lucy the kind of love she never
     had.  But I would be lying.

          SAM
     I hope I hope I hope that you're saying
     what I think you're saying even though
     you're not saying it.

Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong
arms.  For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the
most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to
say goodbye.

          RANDY
     Goodnight.  I'll see you in court.  Save
     me a seat...on your side.

Randy walks away.  Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in
his arms.  Then, from a very brave place:

          SAM
     Randy!  If I tell you I can't do it
     alone, will you tell the judge?

          RANDY
               (turns gently)
     No.

          SAM
     Promise?

          RANDY
     Promise...

          SAM
     I've looked and looked for a mother for
     Lucy. 
     Help, I need someone, help, not just
     anyone.  You're the red in Lucy's
     painting.

ON RANDY

So unexpectedly bonded to them both.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

A glorious sunny day.  Lucy and her team are in the middle of
a fierce game.  A foul is called when we hear -

          SAM
     Penalty!  Rules broken.  Penalty,
     please!

Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking
his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.

Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers.  Robert, in
sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows
around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to
her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.  

They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.  Lucy
and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.

          OBNOXIOUS MOM
     Get her!  Phillip, you get her!

          ROBERT
     I saw that!  You gave him a secret
     signal!  Didn't you?

          IFTY
     Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls
     are round - on sale at Kmart.  The earth
     is a ball, too...

Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he
can.  Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.

          SAM
     Penalty!  Repeat!  Rules broken! 
     Penalty!

          RITA (O.S.)
     Penalty?!  Sue him!  Kick his ass outta
     the game!

It's RITA!  With Danny - hollering from the stands.

ON LUCY

Looks over at her father.  Sam does every coaching gesture,
and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.  It
looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.

ON LUCY

She does it right back at him.  Their secret code.  The code
that will bind them for the rest of their lives.

ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERS

All watching.  What the hell was that?  Sam blows his
whistle.

          SAM
     Play ball!  Play ball!

The game heats up.  Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed
toward the goal.  Sam is running right alongside them, so
excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and
intercepts the ball!  Sam runs valiantly down the field with
it!  We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...

Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.  Little
darlin', it feels like years since you've been here.  Here
comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's
alright..."

And the CREDITS ROLL.

               FADE TO BLACK.
