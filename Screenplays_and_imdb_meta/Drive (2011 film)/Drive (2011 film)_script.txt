          1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1
                         
           We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
           as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
           the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...hundred thousand streets in this city,
           you don't need to know the route. You give
           me a time and place, I give you a five
           minute window. Those five minutes I'm
           yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
           either side you're on your own...
                         
           As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2
                         
           A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
           routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
                         
           DRIVER O/S
           ...One last thing. You won't be able to
           reach me at this number again...
                         
           DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
           in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
           packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
           cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
           Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
                         
          3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3
                         
           Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
           bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
           out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
           way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
                         
          4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4
                         
           The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
           only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
           passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
           Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
           carefully, letting other cars overtake.
                         
          5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5
                         
           Driver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment
           block.

          6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6
                         
           Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
           elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
           pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
           meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
                         
          7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7
                         
           Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
           apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
           sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
           tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
                         
          8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8
                         
           Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
           the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
           shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
           lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
           vintage cars.
                         
          9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9
                         
           SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
           follows him past rows of vintage cars.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
           with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
           You get any sleep?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Not this week.
                         
           As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I can offer you some Halcyon.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Won't work.
                         
           They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
           arrive at a plain looking Impala.
                         
                          SHANNON
           There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
           car in the state of California...
                         
           Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
           out his hand for the keys.

          10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10
                         
           The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
           Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
           of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
           9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
                         
          11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
                         
           A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
           Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
           signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
           making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
           the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
           Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
           buried!...
                         
           Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
           scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
           Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
           commentary now.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...9 Adam 81, what is your current
           location?...Repeat, what is your current
           location?...
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Another unbelievable three pointer from
           Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
                         
           Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
           doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
           bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
           pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
           blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
           The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Time out Knicks...
                         
           The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
           commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
                         
           The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
           going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
           minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
           bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
           without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

           The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
           scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
           His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
           what's happened to his partner.
                         
           Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
           his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
                         
           Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
           fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
           few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
                         
          12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12
                         
           Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
           Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
           speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
           masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
           his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
           his police scanner crackles to life.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...Attention all units...211...Superstore

           Impala...
                         
           Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
           River again, heading back in the same direction he came.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle
           Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all
           units standby...
                         
           Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
           sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
           Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
           switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.
                         
          13 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 13
                         
           The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
           out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
           It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
           probing to see if there's anyone out there.
                         
                          POLICE SCANNER
           ...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle

           sign of suspects...
                         
           The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
           glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.

           It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
           taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
           there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
           same direction as the black-and-white.
                         
          14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14
                         
           It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
           at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
           won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
           through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
           shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...And for the first time in the game the
           Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to
           go in the Fourth here at the Staples
           Centre...
                         
           Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
           swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
           anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
           the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
           chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
                         
           Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
           helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
           just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
           closer and closer.
                         
           Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
           there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
           slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
           chopper's searchlights spot them.
                         
          15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15
                         
           The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
           crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
           can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
           the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
                         
          16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16
                         
           Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
           Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
           factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
           The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
           basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
           sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.
                         
                          DRIVER

           respect now.

           There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
           behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
           still playing.

           Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the
           Clippers by one...
                         
           The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
           trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
           approaching in the opposite direction.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           ...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.
           This game really is too close to call...
                         
           The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
           Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
           turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.

           plates...Appears to be only one occupant...
                         
           In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
           police dispatch to respond.

           out...
                         
           As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
           street.

           Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
           opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
           the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.

           Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
           smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
           glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
           overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
           its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
                         
           Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
           of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
           him as he guns down Figueroa.

           Even now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the
           basketball game.
                         
                          BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
           Thornton pulls up from behind the arc,
           misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to
           play...
                         
           Driver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the
           Staples Centre.

           The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
           barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
           ticket and roars into the parking lot.
                         
          21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21
                         
           The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
           going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
           into a free parking space.

           Driver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS
           are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
           is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.

           The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
           anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
           the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.

           Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
           climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
           them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
           Impala himself and heads towards another car.

           Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
           anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
           into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
           sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
           his getaway.

           Driver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we
           PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
           uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several
           other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,
           reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
           GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
                         
           Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN
           being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical
           to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.

           Driver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and
           signs it without a glance.

           Shannon is discussing a car stunt with another AD, using two toy
           cars on the hood of a cop car to demonstrate the danger.

           with a smile.

           Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He
           swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the
           main road.
                         
           In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on

           Charger keeps coming at speed.
                         
           Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
           other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
                         
           The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
           an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
                         
           Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
           his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
           car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
           end over end.
                         
           Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.

           From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's

           You know how much my business made last

           build a car and a couple of seconds for
           these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
           doesn't even make it into the movie.
                         
           Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.

           That sounds like a lot.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
           burn through three, four million a year but
           that's `cause they're using half a dozen
           test drivers and a stable of cars.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

                          SHANNON
           Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
           is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
           the small-town action then work our way up.
           There's close to two thousand events out

           There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.
           TV deals. We'll even name the team after
           you.
                         
           Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away
           as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any
           of this?

           Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You still haven't given me a number?
                         
           Shannon hesitates but only for a second.

           Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
           sure about this.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
           have you got these big money teams don't
           have?
                         
                          SHANNON
           I got a driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           And they got half a dozen Drivers you told
           me.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Not like this one.
                         
           He stares at his friend with quiet conviction.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I been working with this guy a long time -
           I've never seen anything like it. I had the
           money I'd back him myself...
                         
           Bernie Rose considers him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           But you don't have the money.

           Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell
           my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
           gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this
           kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't
           do.

           gets hit by a bus?
                         
           Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
           of a man with a gruff voice.
                         
                          NINO
           What are you doing eating Chink food in my

           What's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria?
           Worst fucking pizza in LA by the way. How
           hard is it to bake a loaf of bread?

           It's the fucking water in this city...
                         
           Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat
           respectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I thought you were supposed to be out of
           town anyway?
                         
                          NINO
           Well, I'm back.
           (Barely a glance at Shannon)
           Take a hike. I need to talk to my partner.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Be polite, Nino. I invited him here.
                         
                          NINO
           Oh, I'm sorry. How you doing, Shannon?
           How's the fucking leg?
                         
           Bernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses
           Shannon gently.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches
           the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself
           face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She
           looks a little startled to see him, then recovers
                         
           PRETTY GIRL (IRENE)
           Hi...

           She joins him in the elevator, carrying a grocery bag with some
           milk and Fruit Loops cereal.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Which floor, ma'am?...

           Fourth please...
                         
           Driver presses the fourth floor button even though it's already
           lit. The doors shut and the elevator starts to climb. Driver
           stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward
           in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally
           open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.
                         
                          IRENE

           Driver and Irene walk down the corridor in the same direction,
           only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than
           he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.
                         
                          IRENE

           Goodbye, ma'am...
                         
           Driver looks at her just long enough not to seem impolite, then
           continues down the corridor, not even glancing back.

           Bright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving
           across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
           of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
           shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
           louder as it picks up speed.
                         
           Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
           makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful
           signage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           `cause I got no idea...
                         
           Shannon smiles to himself.

           Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something
           effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
           fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
           lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.
                         
          32 EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 32
                         
           The glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears
           again, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded
           hot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, "Drive it like you stole
           it", joins Shannon with a confident smile.
                         
           STOCK CAR OWNER

           Maybe where you come from...
                         
           Bernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed
           thoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.
                         
          33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33
                         
           Driver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon
           limping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS,
           and Bernie Rose.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Looks a little long in the tooth to me.
           Think we should take her home?...
                         
           Driver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie, this is the driver I been telling
           you about...
                         
           One look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and
           authority behind his deceptively gentle eyes.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Bernie's thinking of investing in our race

           The old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER
           My hands are a little dirty.

           He gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up.
           Driver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's
           owner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.
                         
           STOCK CAR OWNER
           Couldn't see much wrong with that. You beat
           the fastest lap by more than half a second.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You might wanna take a look at the
           suspension before we go again.
           (Turning back to Bernie)
           Nice to meet you...
                         
           Bernie's still studying him.

           You too...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car
           owner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares
           after him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's
           getting interested.
                         
                          SHANNON

           Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
           past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
           choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
           eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
           browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
           is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
           of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
           picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
           snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
           turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
           before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.
                         
          35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35
                         
           Driver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of
           groceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.
           Irene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.
           She tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening
           the hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.
           Benicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.

           Driver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to
           his car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing
           frustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.
                         
           Irene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then
           smiling. We watch from a distance as they talk now.
                         
          35a INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 35a
                         
           Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator,
           Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags.
                         
          36 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 36
                         
           Driver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Where do you want me to put them?
                         
                          IRENE
           Just over there. Thanks...
                         
           Driver places the bags on the kitchen counter.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like something to drink?
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm okay.
                         
                          IRENE
           A glass of water?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Sure...
                         
           She pours him a glass of water and hands it to him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Excuse me a second...
                         
           She walks out of the room, leaving Driver alone with Benicio.
           The little boy stares at him fixedly.
                         
          36a INT. BATHROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 36a
                         
           Irene closes the bathroom door behind her, looking at herself in
           the mirror, feeling a little uncertain.
                         
          37 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 37
                         
           Benicio's still staring at Driver. Feeling a little awkward,
           Driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket, tugs it
           gently, then holds up two pieces of string.

           Benicio keeps staring at him, puzzled by the magic trick. Irene
           walks back into the room, smiling.
                         
                          IRENE
           You just move to LA?
                         
                          DRIVER
           No, I been here a while.
                         
                          IRENE
           And before that?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Here and there...
                         
                          IRENE
           (A gentle smile)
           Too many questions, huh?...
                         
           Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond.
           Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the
           couch.
                         
           Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices
           a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio
           and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to
           a strikingly handsome Latino man.
                         
           Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.
                         
                          IRENE
           That's Benicio's father.
                         
           Driver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at
           her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           What's he do?
                         
                          IRENE
           He's in jail.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm sorry.

           What do you do?
                         
           Driver hesitates.
                         
                          DRIVER

           He nods, a little embarrassed.
                         
                          IRENE
           Isn't that dangerous?
                         
           He seems thrown by her concern.
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's just part-time. Most days I work in a

           You should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy.
                         
                          DRIVER
           He interested in that kind of stuff?

           Aren't all little boys?
                         
           She smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him.
                         
           BENICIO O/S
           Mama, I don't like this...
                         
           Irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver
           watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like another glass?

           with another good humored smile.

           Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio
           are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look
           like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a
           basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.
                         
           Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing
           gently on a cup of coffee.
                         
          39 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 39
                         
           The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's
           windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off
           from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS
           and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above
           airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.
                         
          40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40
                         
           It's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable
           to sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit
           mini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out
           with intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.
           Driver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the
           longest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a
           weapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in
           his eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.

           own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs.

           Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard
           and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat
           opposite him.

           Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The
           Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a
           moment, then decides against it, standing up.
                         
                          BEARDED REDNECK

           The loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the
           second hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine.

           Driver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the
           vehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt.
           He takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his
           white hair, breaking into a friendly smile.

                          IRENE
           I can come back later if you're busy...
                         
                          SHANNON
           He's busy, I'm not...
                         
           Shannon gives Driver another sly look as he takes her car keys.
                         
          43 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 43
                         
           The Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in
           years. Shannon is bent over the hood.
                         
                          SHANNON
           ...Just my opinion, but I think you should
           consider buying a new car...
                         
                          IRENE
           (With gentle irony)
           That would be great...
                         
           She glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt
           with Driver, watching him work on his own car now.

           Driver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy.
           His lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio.
                         
                          BENICIO
           That thing doesn't work.
                         
                          DRIVER

           You think?
                         
           Benicio watches him sullenly, more intrigued than he lets on.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Drive it.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Okay. Get in the car...
                         
           Benicio considers a moment, then turns and calls out to Irene.
                         
                          BENICIO
           Mama, can I go in the car?!
                         
           Irene looks over in surprise, not sure what to say.

           Driver and Benicio sit in the Chevelle, driving in silence.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Your mom said you like movies?

           Benicio shakes his head.

           Shannon's got his tool kit out, examining the Olds. Irene looks
           at the forecourt but there's no sign of Driver and her son.

           Shannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver.
                         
                          SHANNON
           We been together about five years now. He
           showed up out of the blue one day, no
           references or nothin', asking me for a job.
           I offered him half the wages I normally pay
           and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting
           him ever since...
                          (HE GRINS)
           Only thing he knows is cars...

           The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat
           Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a
           landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and
           shredded tires, picking up speed all the time.
                         
          47 EXT. LA RIVER - DAY. 47
                         
           Driver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal
           which looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft
           rock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree.

           Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's
           giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks
           at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his
           eyes fixed on the road.

           Cradling the sleeping Benicio in his arms Driver lays him down
           on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his
           pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room,
           uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son.

           He stares back at her in the silence, both of them looking a
           little uncertain.
                         
                          IRENE
           I'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you

           Don't worry...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
           finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
           door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
           knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
           him back. Instead he just offers his help.
                         
                          DRIVER

           Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits
           beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.

           Irene emerges with Benicio from the dentists. The little boy is
           clutching his mouth, making a show of being in pain. Irene
           teases him gently as they walk. Driver waits for them in his
           car, watching them quietly.

           Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger
           seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
           no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
           changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
           out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
           Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.

           The roar of machinery. We see quick shots of Driver's day in the
           garage -- fixing cars, taking out some fruit he's left to ripen
           in his tool box for lunch, working on more engines and frames.
           At the end of the day Driver and Shannon examine the stock car.

           On the TV, a Japanese cartoon is playing, a masked hero
           confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
           black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching
           the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some
           time has passed and they know each other a little better.
                         
                          DRIVER

           earth alone he'll fight him.
                         
           Irene calls out from her bedroom.

           surrounding the hero.
                         
                          DRIVER

           Just as the fight begins the color on the TV screen flickers.

           kneels beside the TV.

           This is pretty complicated. You watching?
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
           the interference stops.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Think you can remember that?...
                         
           Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
           the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
           waitress's uniform, and answers it.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
                         
           Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
           to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
           Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
           over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
           who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.
                         
           YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)

           Irene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of
           the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.

           I've never come this way before...
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's a short cut...
                         
                          IRENE
           The park looks pretty at night...
                         
           She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away
           again.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You okay?...
                         
           Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the
           window.
                         
                          IRENE
           That was my husband's lawyer on the phone.
           He's getting an early release...
                         
           She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
           though it hits him like a sledgehammer.
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's great...
                         
                          IRENE
           I'm happy for Benicio...
                         
           Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
           anything, driving in silence.
                         
           Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
           stop.
                         
           Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
           Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
           something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
                         
           She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
           back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
                         
           The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
           out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
           hand, as if nothing's happened.
                         
           Outside the lights change to green.

           Dad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on.

           Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his
           FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his
           arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I'm touched and grateful that you're all
           here today -- even though I know it's
           probably for the food not me...
                         
           His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
           agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
           Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA

           get our lives back together...
                         
           He raises his glass to her.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'd like to thank my wife for being the

           loyal woman I know...
                         
           More applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face,
           feeling even more uncomfortable.

           Driver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to
           the sound of the party echoing down the corridor.

           It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the
           phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'm sorry, I can't hear you...
                         
           He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the
           other end is accented and unfriendly.
                         
           MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           Can you hear me now, you cunt?
                         
           Standard pauses, looking concerned.

           Sure.

           Across the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard. She sees
           him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.
                         
                          IRENE
           Benicio wants you to put him to bed.

           Okay.

           My parole officer. He thinks he may have

           The noise of the party is finally too much for Driver. He gets
           off the bed and slips on his jacket.

           Irene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into
           the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
           hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
           then calls out.
                         
                          IRENE
           Hey...
                         
           He turns around and sees her standing there with a smile.
                         
                          IRENE
           I'm sorry about the noise. I was going to
           leave a note under your door warning you we
           were having a party.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Don't worry. I won't complain.
                         
                          IRENE
           I wish you would. Maybe the cops'd show up
           and send everybody home.
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other, the music pounding in the
           background.

           I'm glad.
                         
           Another awkward silence, so much she wants to say but can't.

           Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open.
           Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He
           pauses, then smiles.

           He grins at his wife, then looks over at Driver, his smile
           hiding whatever he feels inside.
                         
                          STANDARD
           You're the new neighbor, right? Benicio's
           told me all about you...
                         
           Driver seems unsure how to respond.
                         
                          DRIVER
           He's a great kid.
                         
                          STANDARD

           great mother.
                         
           Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring
           at Driver.

           He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the
           corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.
           Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as
           Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand
           there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other
           waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.

           this?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.
           Anyway, that's just the shell. You start
           with the shell, then you build the frame,
           then the motor.
           (Pointing to an engine nearby)
           I paid three hundred for that. The money
           goes on the inside not the outside.
                         
                          NINO
           Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred
           I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go
           waste your money on something else...
                         
           Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his
           deal with Bernie.

           You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...
                         
           At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too
           busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the
           door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Try her out. She's more comfortable than a
           water bed.

           He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all
           the control buttons as if he wants to break them.

                          NINO
           How about this little clit? I don't know
           whether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it,
           I'll drive it...
                         
           Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then
           looks away, observing Driver quietly.
                         
           Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work
           he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.
                         
           BERNIE ROSE O/S
           How you doing?...
                         
           Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up
           respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           So, when's our first race?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Soon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You gonna be ready?
                         
           There's something gently challenging in his gaze.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I hope so...

           promises you can't keep...
                         
           Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard
           to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the
           T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches
           them.

                          BERNIE ROSE
           I did some producing back in the 80's.
           Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
           Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
           all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
           me but I loved having him around. His next
           business venture he tried the same thing
           with some of Nino's friends they broke his
           spine. He never had much luck...
                         
           He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar
           voice.
                         
           STANDARD O/S
           Hey!...
                         
           Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading
           towards him with a confident smile.
                         
                          STANDARD
           You got a minute? I want to -
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           We're talking...
                         
           Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet
           menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively
           senses this is someone you don't mess with.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I'll wait outside...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then
           turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The reason I'm telling you this is because
           he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anything you need just let me know...
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally
           walks away.

                          STANDARD
           I do worry. I like to pay my debts.
                         
           Driver senses the quiet pride in his voice, and lets it go.

           Call it fifty.
                         
           Standard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his
           eyes lowered.
                         
                          STANDARD
           I was thinking of trading her in for a new

                          DRIVER
           You can't have both.

           Alright then, fast.
                         
           Even though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on
           his handsome face.

           Standard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering
           him, then looks back at Driver.

           I'd like that...
                         
           His gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing
           herself.
                         
                          IRENE
           I better serve some food...
                         
           It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this
           is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.
                         
          70 INT. KITCHEN/ MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 70
                         
           Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to
           go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out
           again he's no longer there.
                         
          71 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 71
                         
           Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the
           gates of the underground car park.
                         
          72 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - NIGHT. 72
                         
           As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a
           group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction,
           heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair.
           Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's
           direction then looks away.
                         
           Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way
           further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in
           the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.
           A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car
           now, climbing out to see what's happened.
                         
           The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he
           realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he
           clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at
           his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver
           kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Can you move?

           He's right here...
                         
           Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises
           his head painfully and looks at his son.

           Benicio nods, too choked-up to speak. Standard turns to Driver.

           Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As
           he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his
           toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around
           and looks at Driver.
                         
                          STANDARD

           hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him.

           shows.

           over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The
           little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.

                          COOK
           Good. Anything else?...
                         
           Driver stares back at him with his clear blue eyes.
                         
                          DRIVER
           We do this job he's paid his debt. You
           leave him and his family alone...
                         
           Cook looks surprised at first, then laughs at his nerve.
                         
                          COOK

           The midday sun beats down on a maze of cars. Driver strolls past
           rows of glittering vehicles until he spots an old model Mustang.
                         
          78 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 78
                         
           Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio
           now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife.
                         
                          STANDARD
           ...I was such a jerk the first time we met.
           We're at this party and I see the most
           beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I
           walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's
           Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me
           and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'...
                          (HE LAUGHS)
           It took me like a minute to get it...

           Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager
           to please his dad.
                         
                          STANDARD
           You don't get it either do you, Benicio?
           Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains.
                         
           He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of
           tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.
                         
                          IRENE
           Would you like some more chicken?

           Thanks...
                         
           Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the
           look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass
           and tuck into his food.
                         
                          STANDARD
           Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken.
           Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant
           together once I raise the money. That's why
           she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure
           out how it's done. She's got more ambition
           than anyone I know, more smarts too...

           Fine...
                         
           Irene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink.
                         
                          IRENE

           He raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he
           is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on
           someone his wife clearly admires.

           It's okay. I'll take him...
                         
           Standard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms
           and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even
           in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son.
           Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver.
                         
                          IRENE

           She hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to
           confide in someone.
                         
                          IRENE

           Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more
           torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.
                         
          79 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 79

           Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He
           stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick,
           finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual.
                         
          81 EXT. PAWN SHOP/ TARAZANA/ LA - DAY. 81
                         
           The pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside,
           another anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a
           hundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling.
           Standard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You don't have to do this.

           He tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out
           of his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the
           pawn shop and looks even more nervous now.

                          STANDARD

           He forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens

           Driver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of
           foreboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his
           stopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.
                         
           He casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest
           details -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of
           overlooking buildings.
                         
           The white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop
           windows, hiding everything inside.
                         
           The police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver
           listens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the
           engine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading
           for the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.
                         
           He pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.
           Parked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle
           glinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different
           from the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.
           For one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers
           and racing tires.
                         
           Driver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from
           the Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting
           Standard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.
                         
           But there's no sign of them.
                         
           The seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his
           instincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,
           thinking of Irene.
                         
           Suddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,
           Standard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.

           He smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the
           crack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on
           his face as he spins around.
                         
           A GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in
           an expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The
           force of the bullets sends Standard flying.
                         
           Driver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from
           his neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into
           the back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look
           at Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots
           crack behind him.
                         
           As Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly
           comes to life, pulling out of its parking place.
                         
          82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82
                         
           Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
           his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
           following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
           open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           ...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this
           much money!...
                         
           There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
           inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
           but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
           intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
           them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
           draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Move for Chrissakes!...
                         
           Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
           corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
           move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
           honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
           speed.
                         
           The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
                         
           Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
           match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
           weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
           himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
           move, staying on his tail.
                         
           In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

           Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
           deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
           the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
           pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle. 
                         
           Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
           regains control of his car.
                         
           The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
           him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
           pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
           Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
                         
           Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
           Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
           closing fast.
                         
           It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
           for an instant.
                         
           The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
                         
           Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
           construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
           pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
           spinning 270 degrees.
                         
           The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
           maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
           corner he can't control. 
                         
           The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
           sickening crunch of metal on metal.
                         
           Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

           The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim
           with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.

           She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is.
           Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking
           through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery
           yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.
                         
                          DRIVER

           A soap opera plays on the TV. Driver walks back into the motel
           room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver
           picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he
           finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a
           police mug-shot of Standard on screen.
                         
                          TV REPORT

           Guzman of Echo Park, Los Angeles...
                         
           Driver listens to the report in silence. Blanche seems upset
           again, confronted with the reality of what's happened.
                         
                          TV REPORT
           ...Other details are unclear but the owner
           of the pawn shop told reporters that the
           robber had no accomplices and that the
           items he'd taken had been recovered. In
           other news...
                         
           Driver switches off the TV, staring at the blank screen in
           surprise. He turns to Blanche.
                         
                          DRIVER
           The guy saw you grab the money and jump in

                          DRIVER
           You just got a little kid's father killed.
           You think I won't hurt you?
                         
           He raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks,
           tears welling in her eyes.
                         
                          BLANCHE

           Driver stares at her quietly, beginning to put the pieces
           together in his head.

                          DRIVER
           How long have you known him?
                         
                          BLANCHE
           Just a couple months. We were fooling
           around. I've never been mixed up in
           anything like this -

           He told me it was Chris, but I just called
           him Cook.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You're going to take me to him right now,
           you understand?
                         
           She nods, terrified, tears running down her face.

           open as if she's called someone recently.
                         
           Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
           of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
           handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
           there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
                         
           Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
           He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.

           Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
           through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
           head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
           big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
           window where he just shot her.
                         
           Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
           can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
           hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
           forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
                         
           Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
           the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
           they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
           the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
           hitman and grabs his shotgun.

           In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
           Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
           firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
           up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
           doll.
                         
           The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
           it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
           his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
           all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
           man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
                         
           Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
           pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.

           hears a noise in the garage.

           Shannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily
           towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his
           hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but
           there's no sign of it.

           Driver shakes his head, closing his eyes. Shannon watches him
           quietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money.

           An elegant apartment full of framed photographs of beautiful
           grandchildren and movie posters from Hollywood's golden age.
           Bernie is in his silk pyjamas, looking like he's just woken up.

           Shannon looks tense but tries to hide it. From next door they
           can hear the sound of raised voices. Bernie Rose grabs the TV
           remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           They've been going at it ever since they
           moved in. She's such a nice lady but it's a
           lousy Shidach. It's a wonder they haven't
           killed each other...

           It's a strip joint on La Cienega. Your
           friend Cook runs it. Why're you curious
           about him all of a sudden?
                         
           Even though they're close, Shannon's wary of giving away too
           much information.

           Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs,
           passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful
           of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is
           empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS
           emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he
           puts them at ease with a friendly smile.

           door handle as if he can't get in.

           He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He
           waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
                         
           Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
           him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
           heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
           left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
           Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.

           it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
           door but Driver couldn't care less.

           Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig.

           bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
           what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the
           call log and finds the same number appearing again and again.

           me?...
                         
           The voice is unmistakable. Driver stares quietly.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Seems that way...

           And you're calling me why? You expect me to
           buy my fucking stuff back from you?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm not selling. I give you a time and
           place, you come collect your stuff...
                         
                          NINO
           And what do you get out of it?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           Just that. Out of it. You put a muzzle on
           Cook, forget your zombies at the Motel,
           forget we ever had this conversation...
                         
           Nino's thinking to himself, looking more concerned than he
           sounds.
                         
                          NINO
           Your partners happy with that?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           I don't have partners...
                         
                          NINO
           You discuss this with anyone else?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Just you...
                         
           Nino begins to relax now, still calculating.
                         
                          NINO
           You're not very good at this, are you?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           This isn't what I do. I'll call again with
           instructions...
                         
           Driver switches the cell phone off.

           Nino hangs up. Behind him we see that Tan Suit is also in the
           room, waiting for his orders.
                         
          104 INT. LIVING ROOM/ IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 104
                         
           Irene is sitting on the couch next to Benicio, talking to him
           gently as he watches TV.
                         
                          IRENE
           ...I'll be back before you go to bed. How's
           that sound?...
                         
           The little boy nods, watching his Japanese cartoon. Irene's
           friend, Cindy, is also there, gazing at them both in sympathy.
           Irene looks up at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           Are you going to be okay?
                         
                          CINDY
           We'll be fine...
                         
           Irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings. She walks over and
           opens the door then stops in surprise. Driver stands there.
                         
                          DRIVER
           You got a minute?...
                         
           She looks at him in a daze.
                         
                          IRENE
           Where have you been?...
                         
           He stares back at her in silence.
                         
                          IRENE
           I tried to reach you. Standard's been -
                         
                          DRIVER
           I know...
                         
           His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something
           more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a
           small voice interrupts.
                         
           BENICIO O/S
           Hey...
                         
           Driver looks over at the little boy.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Hey...

           Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits
           her. She stares in disbelief, reeling.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I'm sorry about your father...
                         
           Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any
           more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He
           looks back at her.
                         
                          IRENE
           I can't talk now. I have to go.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Can I give you a ride?
                         
           She stares at him in dismay, close to tears.
                         
                          IRENE
           The car's working fine.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Then let me walk you down...
                         
           She wants to say no but can't.
                         
          105 INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 105
                         
           Driver and Irene head down the long corridor in silence.
                         
                          IRENE
           (Almost a whisper)
           Why?...
                         
           Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard.
                         
                          DRIVER
           He was into one of the prison gangs for a
           lot of money. He was trying to protect you.
                         
                          IRENE
           Great job...
                         
           She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver
           follows her.
                         
                          DRIVER
           I still have the money. Whatever you need -
                         
           She turns around and slaps him hard.
                         
                          IRENE
           What are you, a bank? I work for a living.
           I don't need your widow's pension!

           Her eyes well up with tears, staring at him in anger and
           frustration.
                         
                          IRENE
           Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you
           into it?
                         
                          DRIVER
           He didn't talk me into anything. I've been
           doing this my whole life. It's what I do...
                         
           She stares at him in deep disappointment.
                         
                          IRENE
           Stupid me...
                         
           She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,
           revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but
           we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Sorry, I'm supposed to be going down...
                         
                          IRENE
           So are we...
                         
           She steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.
                         
                          TAN SUIT
           Which floor?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Parking lot, please...
                         
           Tan Suit presses the button and the doors slide shut.
                         
          106 INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 106
                         
           Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each
           other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but
           Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
           on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
           reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
           him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the
           darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of
           them heading in the opposite direction.
                         
          107 INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 107
                         
           The overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park
           hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In
           the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.

           Irene can't believe what she's hearing.
                         
                          IRENE
           What are you talking about?

           You and Benicio...
                         
           She's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.
                         
                          IRENE
           You're crazy. I don't even know you -
                         
                          DRIVER
           You will. Once I straighten out this thing
           I'm getting out for good. We'll go some
           place. Anywhere you want.
                         
           She shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.
                         
                          IRENE
           It doesn't work like that.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Why not?...
                         
           She stops and looks at him.
                         
                          IRENE
           Because people like you never get out. And
           I don't want my son to grow up like that...
                         
           She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when
           suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
           eye.
                         
           A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
           her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
           the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
                         
           Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
           parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
           her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
                         
           More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
           car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
                         
           Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
           Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
           parked cars.

           Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
           looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
           all her worst fears have been confirmed.
                         
           Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
           approaching.
                         
           He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
           runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
                         
           Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
           the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
           reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
                         
           Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
           chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
           and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
                         
           Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
           footsteps.
                         
           Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
           time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
           pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
           car.
                         
           Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
           him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
                         
           Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
           picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
                         
           Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
           resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
           him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
                         
           The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
           Tan Suit's skull.
                         
           Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
           elevator, framed against the light.
                         
           She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
                         
           Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
           elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.

           Shannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his
           own car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at
           him a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt.

                          DRIVER
           Nino's guys came after me. How did they
           know about Irene?
                         
           Shannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed.
                         
                          SHANNON
           I called Bernie...I asked if he could help.
           Him and Nino are like brothers. I told him
           you weren't interested in the money, that
           you only did it for the girl...
           (From the heart)
           I wanted to make sure once you returned the
           money that was the end of it...
                         
           Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
                         
                          SHANNON
           Let me talk to Bernie again. They probably
           didn't listen to him -
                         
                          DRIVER
           It's too late...
                         
           Shannon says nothing now, knowing he's right.
                         
                          DRIVER
           They're gonna come after you to find me.
           You have to leave...
                         
           Shannon takes this in slowly.
                         
                          SHANNON
           What are you gonna do?...
                         
           Driver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess.
                         
                          SHANNON
           How the fuck did this happen? We're

           drinking champagne out of trophies and
           getting laid by pit lizards...

           Bernie Rose looks quietly furious.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           ...I already gave you my advice. You should
           have taken your money and left this guy
           alone.
                         
           Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.
                         
                          NINO
           It's not that simple, Bernie.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Not now that it's bounced up in your face.
                         
                          COOK
           Mr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give
           me the okay and I'll -
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You like taking orders, go shut the blinds.
                         
           He looks at Cook's broken hands.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Sun's in my eyes...
                         
           Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as
           he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the
           windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.
                         
                          NINO
           ...The money belonged to a half assed
           wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was
           keeping a million in a pawn shop and was
           gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a
           rival operation. I wanted to teach him a
           lesson...
                         
           The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the
           blinds.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           last time I checked we were partners! -

           Then why the fuck didn't you come to me
           before you set up your dummy robbery or
           hired this fucking amateur?!...
                         
           Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino
           looks almost embarrassed for once.
                         
                          NINO
           This was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't
           wanna involve you.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Well, now you fucked up I am involved.
           Anyone finds out you stole from the family
           they'll kill both of us -

           What family? These fucks still call me a
           kike to my face. I'm fifty nine years old,
           they pinch my cheek, treat me like a
           fuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New
           York in the first place. Decrepit old men
           waving us over to their dinner and domino
           tables to complain.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Those old men gave us the funds to move out
           here.
                         
                          NINO

           lotta money too...
                         
           He stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now.

           earn and then they set up some fucking kid
           from Philadelphia just because he's a
           fucking wop!
                         
           There's a hint of sympathy in Bernie's eyes.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The money always flows up, Izzy. You know
           that.
                         
           He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact
           that they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first
           time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.
                         
                          NINO
           That's why this driver has to go. Him, and
           maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two
           people who can tie me to the robbery.

           What about this prick?
                         
           He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.

           team.
                         
           He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their
           friendship.

           Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
           two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
           straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
           in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
           in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
           with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
                         
           Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his
           own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.

           The CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the
           background we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.
           Driver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the
           make-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around
           the trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask
           he saw previously on the film set.

           Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in
           his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.
           Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.

           I'm looking for your driver.
                         
                          SHANNON
           You break in like this I figure it's bad
           news.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this
           city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.
                         
                          SHANNON
           He tried to put it right.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Picked the wrong guy for that too. My
           partner's a belligerent asshole with his
           back against the wall...
                         
           He stops, facing Shannon.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Right now so am I. I don't take care of
           this I'm in big trouble...
                         
           He stares at his old friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Any idea where he is?
                         
                          SHANNON
           Probably across the border by now. Mexico.
           Belize. That's where I'd go...
                         
           Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           He just walked out on you after everything
           you've done for him, took all the money?
                         
                          SHANNON
           That's gratitude, I guess.
                         
           Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite
           everything.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been
           friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a
           neighborhood of wops. Long as I can
           remember he was getting me into trouble and
           I was getting him out of scrapes...
                         
           He looks almost apologetic.

           Anyone else I'd take your side...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Anyone else I'd do the same...
                         
           Bernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           What's this fucking kid to you anyway?
                         
           Shannon shrugs, no idea himself.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I leave here without finding out where he
           is, there'll be others coming after me. I
           guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure
           out you won't talk and drag this out
           unnecessarily...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Then I'm glad you got here first...
                         
           Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny
           stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You know, it's too bad, I was getting
           excited about our race team, having my name
           all over the car. I think we could have
           made something of this business...
                         
                          SHANNON
           Nah, I'd have fucked it up too...
                         
           Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and
           extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,
           when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
                         
           We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein
           cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,
           paralysed with shock.
                         
           Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with
           Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him
           down against the boot of the stock car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and
           you'll fall asleep...
                         
           Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie
           Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a
           handkerchief.

           Bernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box
           full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors
           arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly
           storms towards his front door.
                         
          111b EXT. CORRIDOR/ BERNIE ROSE'S NEIGHBORS' APARTMENT - DAY. 111b
                         
           A loud knocking. Bernie Rose's neighbor opens his door.
                         
                          HUSBAND
           Yeah?
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Bernie Rose, next apartment over -
                         
                          HUSBAND
           Yeah, I know. I'm kind of busy here.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I heard...
                         
           There's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The
           husband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his
           elbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You all right, Shonda?
                         
           The woman nods without meeting his eyes.
                         
                          HUSBAND
           Get the hell out of my -
                         
           Bernie doesn't give him time to finish, clamping a powerful hand
           on his throat.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           What's your fucking name?

                          BERNIE ROSE
           I'm a patient man, Lenny, not much for
           getting in other people's way. What I
           figure is, we've all got our own lives,
           right? And the right to be left alone?
                          (SQUEEZING HARDER)
           So I sit next door for almost a year now
           listening to what goes down in here and I
           keep thinking, hey, they'll work it out.
           You gonna work it out, Lenny?

           He jerks the husband's neck forward, making him nod.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You're lucky to have her, lucky she's put
           up with you this long. Lucky I've put up
           with you. She has good reason: she loves
           you. I don't have any reason at all. So
           stop raising your voice or fucking move...
                         
           He lets go of the terrified man and storms out again.

           Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows
           down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,
           glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the
           garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.
                         
          113 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 113
                         
           Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage
           cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the
           vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock
           car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently
           against the trunk of the car.
                         
           Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for
           a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and
           opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of
           money.

           Nino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no
           shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the
           curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed
           WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
           also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting
           ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           Alright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.

           Two big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we
           recognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it
           again we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask.
           He crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.

           recognize him.
                         
                          NINO'S GUY
           We're closed...
                         
           Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by
           more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out
           again.

           white Lincolns.
                         
                          NINO
           (To one of his men)

           there...
                         
           Across the road Driver climbs into his car, still wearing the
           mask. He starts his car, setting off after Nino's Lincoln.

           The streets are less crowded in this residential area. As the
           car in front of Driver pulls into its front drive, Driver takes
           the next turning, making sure the Lincoln doesn't spot him.

           intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same
           direction down a parallel street.

           The sun has almost set, the red backlights of the cars blinking
           in the fading light.
                         
          129 INT. NINO'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 129
                         
           Nino's car turns into 7th Street.
                         
          130 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SAN VINCENTE/ 7TH STREET - NIGHT. 130
                         
           This time there are no other vehicles turning into the same
           street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln.
                         
          131 INT. NINO'S CAR/ 7TH STREET/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 131
                         
           The chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's
           car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought.
           In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Nice talking to you too...
           (As he hangs up)
           Asshole...
                         
          132 EXT. ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 132
                         
           Both cars head into Entrada Drive.

          133 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 133
                         
           The chauffeur checks his mirror again and notices Driver's car
           still on his tail. Just as a precaution he slows down, seeing if
           the pursuing car will overtake.
                         
          134 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE - NIGHT. 134
                         
           Driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the
           invitation. He overtakes the Lincoln, speeding ahead.
                         
          135 INT. NINO'S CAR/ ENTRADA DRIVE/ PACIFIC PALISADES - NIGHT. 135
                         
           Nino's chauffeur sees Driver's car disappear up ahead, relaxing
           now.
                         
          136 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ WEST CHANNEL ROAD/ PCH - NIGHT. 136
                         
           Driver puts his foot on the gas, taking sharp turns on small
           side streets, driving fast around the block until he's back on
           the Lincoln's tail, keeping a safe distance now.
                         
          137 INT. NINO'S CAR/ W.CHANNEL RD./ PCH - NIGHT. 137
                         
           Nino's chauffeur turns right into the Pacific Coast Highway.
                         
          138 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 138
                         
           Driver follows the Lincoln at a distance, keeping the winding
           corners of the PCH between himself and his prey.
                         
          139 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 139
                         
           From above we see Driver's car gliding along the open highway,
           the rising hills on one side, the churning ocean on the other,
           no vehicles in sight.
                         
          140 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 140
                         
           In the back seat Nino dials another number on his cell-phone.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Bernie, it's me...
                         
          141 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 141
                         
           The headlights of Driver's car sweep ahead of it on the open
           road. From above it looks like a shark closing in on its prey.
                         
          142 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ LA - NIGHT. 142
                         
           Bernie Rose stands by the window, listening to the phone in
           silence.

          143 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 143
                         
           Nino sounds apologetic.
                         
                          NINO
           ...Look, about that thing today...I'm
           sorry. I know how much you liked the guy...
                         
           In his rear view mirror the chauffeur sees the headlights of the
           car behind getting closer.
                         
          144 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 144
                         
           Driver stares ahead, his eyes fixed on the Lincoln's backlights.
                         
          145 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 145
                         
           Bernie Rose doesn't speak, looking weary.
                         
           NINO O/S
           Bernie?...
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Yeah?...
                         
           NINO O/S
           You're the only fucking person in the world
           I trust. I love you, man...
                         
           Bernie shakes his head, the same old apologies.
                         
          146 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 146
                         
           In the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously.
                         
                          NINO
           When this is over I'll make it up to you, I
           swear...
                         
           The lights of the car behind have vanished.
                         
          147 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 147
                         
           Even from above we can't see Driver's car with its lights off -
           no idea how close it is to Nino's car.
                         
          148 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 148
                         
           Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his
           childhood friend.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE

           Nino grins.
                         
                          NINO
           I lost count -
                         
           Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him.
                         
          150 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 150
                         
           Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
           it just above the left rear wheel.
                         
          151 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 151
                         
           The impact is momentous. The huge Continental is lifted up in
           the air and spun round at the same time. It slams back into the
           tarmac then flips end over end for a hundred yards.
                         
          152 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT. 152
                         
           Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead.
                         
          153 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 153
                         
           The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car
           skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.
                         
          154 INT. NINO'S CAR/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 154
                         
           Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He
           unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.
                         
          155 EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155
                         
           Driver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the
           pulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach
           but doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the
           other passengers are dead, then heads on.
                         
          156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156
                         
           Nino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He
           looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
           running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
           clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
                         
           Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
           ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
           and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
           to wade out further, the ocean drags him back.

           Driver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more
           and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
           hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
           barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
           Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
                         
           They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
           silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
           Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
           him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
           grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
           splutters as Driver lets him up again.
                         
                          NINO
           It was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your
           friend not me...
                         
           Driver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there
           until Nino's body finally stops thrashing.
                         
          157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157
                         
           A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Nino?
                         
           DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           He's dead.
                         
           Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
           part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
           no trace of emotion in his voice.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are
           the only pieces left on the board...
                         
          158 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN - NIGHT. 158
                         
           Driver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean. He
           catches the veiled threat in Bernie's words but doesn't respond.

           Way?

           I can find it.
                         
           Bernie pauses, staring out.
                         
           BERNIE'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
           I'll see you there at one.
                         
           A charged silence, then the line goes dead.

           A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.
           He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
           himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
           wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Care for a glass?...
                         
           Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
           Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
           recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
           shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
           duck's to die for...
                         
           He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,
           calling over a WAITRESS.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           The duck, please. For two.

           No, thanks...
                         
           He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a
           swath out there.

           I never asked for any of it.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           We usually don't. But it comes down on our
           heads regardless. Look at Shannon...
                         
           Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and
           conversation drifting over from the other tables.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Anyway it's water under the bridge now.
           Question is where does that leave us?
                         
                          DRIVER
           That's up to you.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           You bring the cash?
                         
           Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Tell me something, how does someone with no
           interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
           (Off his silence)
           Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
                         
           Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
           and smiles.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Don't worry. Nobody else knows about her.
           Just me...
                          (A BEAT)
           You still see her?...
                         
                          DRIVER
           She's not interested.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           She's got her head screwed on right. I got
           two ex-wives, three kids, four
           grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me
           now...
                         
           He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
           sympathy.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           This is what I'll do for you. You give me
           the money, nobody knows she exists. But
           it's a different matter with you.

           Their eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred

           Driver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half
           hidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,
           taking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't
           even look at it, still admiring the car.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           How much does something like this cost?
                         
                          DRIVER
           Nine, ten thousand. If you can find one

           He grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag.
                         
                          BERNIE ROSE
           Guess we won't be seeing each other again..
                         
           Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
           hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
           Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
           time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
           his throat.
                         
           Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
           like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
           deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
           dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
           Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
                         
           Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
           puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.

           different colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls
           into the lot, searching for a place to park.

           Driver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-
           soaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and
           hides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood
           dripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets
           off through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on
           his cell-phone.

           Sunlight glitters on the roofs of the parked cars, dazzling

           breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
           outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
           he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the
           steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn
           signal.

           Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks
           almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans
           forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,
           we CUT TO BLACK.
