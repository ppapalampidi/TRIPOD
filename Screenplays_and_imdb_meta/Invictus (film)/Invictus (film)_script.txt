          EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY
                         
          A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near
          the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate.
          FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
          total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
                         
          Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
          area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
          AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
          game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
          feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
          noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.
                         
          Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.
                         
          SUPER TITLE: SOUTH AFRICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1990
          A COMMOTION ON THE FREEWAY intrudes on the soccer game.
          Horns honking, cars pull over onto the shoulder, people jump
          out.
                         
                         
          EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
                         
          Lead by police motorbikes, then patrol cars, a white Mercedes
          approaches, heading towards Cape Town. Whoever is in the
          Mercedes has stopped traffic.
                         
                         
          EXT. ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL, WESTERN CAPE - DAY
                         
          The soccer players abandon their game and run for the
          freeway, whistling and shouting.
                         
          The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and
          do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes
          right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust.
                         
           HIGH SCHOOL BOY
           Who is it, sir?
                         
                          COACH
           It's that terrorist, Mandela. They
           let him out.
                          (BEAT)
           Remember this day, boys. It's the
           day our country went to the dogs.

          A short, STOCK-FOOTAGE MONTAGE which spans the tumultuous
          four years between NELSON MANDELA'S release from prison and
          his inauguration as President of South Africa.
                         
          Footage would include:
                         
          - Mandela's release from prison
          - negotiations with the apartheid regime
          - scenes of white fear and emigration
          - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the
                         ELECTIONS
          - the khaki-clad AWB (Afrikaner right wing) attack on the
          World Trade Center (where negotiations were taking place)
          - the lifting of economic sanctions and cultural boycotts
          - the lifting of the international ban on the Springbok rugby
          team and immediate Test match losses to New Zealand and
          Australia.
          - popular black leader Chris Hani's assassination by white
                         RIGHT WINGERS
          - black retaliation
          - Mandela's frantic intervention to keep the country from
          going up in flames
          - the election itself, with those incredible images of
          thousands and thousands of people, black and white, lining up
          patiently, some to vote for the first time in their lives
          - the African National Congress victory
          - Mandela's inauguration as President, where he delivers the
                         FAMOUS WORDS:
                         
           "Never, never and never again shall it be
           that this beautiful land will again
           experience the oppression of one by another,

          INT. MANDELA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dark. We can make out the FORM OF A TALL MAN SLEEPING ALONE
          at the very edge of the big bed, as if not wanting to rumple
          the blankets too much.
                         
          On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.
          The man's eyes open in the dark, instantly awake. He reaches
          out, switches on the light.
                         
          NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in
          one movement. He has the physical vigor and energy of
          someone twenty years younger.
           3.
                         
                         
                         
          The second he is up, he turns around and makes his bed,
          leaving it as flawlessly smooth as a hospital bed. Or a
          prison bunk.
                         
          For this is the discipline of twenty seven years behind bars.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down
          the stairs and heads for the front door.
                         
          This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
          President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous
          man on the planet.
                         
                         
          EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a
          moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical
          conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
                         
          It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
          completely alone in the world.
                         
          The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the
          driveway gate.
                         
          When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH
          AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that
          opens the gate.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          When the gate begins to open we see that there are TWO GREY
          BMWs parked either side of it.
                         
                         
          INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
                         
          LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is
          a big, scowling man dressed in a suit. He checks the load on
          a pistol, tucks it into his shoulder holster.
                         
                          LINGA
           Here he comes. Like clockwork.
                         
                          JASON
           It makes him such an easy target.

          Behind Linga, in the back seat, sits JASON TSHABALALA, a
          naturally tense and suspicious man. Both of them are hollow-
          eyed, exhausted, running on adrenaline.
                         
          They get out of the BMW, fast and quiet. This does not look
          good.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          As Mandela walks out through the gate, Jason and Linga
          intercept him.
                         
                          JASON
           (traditional greeting in
                          XHOSA)
           I see you, father.
                         
          Mandela's face comes alive as he smiles.
                         
                          MANDELA
           (without breaking stride)
           Morning boys. How are you?
                         
          Jason is Mandela's head of personal security, Linga his
          number one bodyguard. They are both former "terrorists", and
          they are utterly devoted to Mandela.
                         
                          JASON
           We're sharp, Madiba.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good ... good. And how's your
           mother doing, Linga?
                         
                          LINGA
           She's much better, thank you.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good.
                         
          Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so
          that they are a few steps behind him.
                         
          They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares
          them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely
          unsanitary, from a security point of view.

          Mandela strides along the big, wide, tree-lined streets.
          Jason and Linga shadow him, eyes and ears alert.
                         
          Up ahead, we see a SMALL, UPSCALE AREA OF SHOPS AND
          RESTAURANTS.

          Mandela, Jason and Linga pass a HUGE POSTER OF MANDELA in the
          window of CORNER GROCERY. Mandela does not react to this
          giant picture of himself, Jason and Linga do, proudly --
                         
          (A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery,
          there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers,
          newspaper centerfolds, T-shirts, children's art -- as if to
          make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were
          banned.)
                         
          -- until they HEAR THE SOUND OF THE VAN tearing towards them.
          They turn, SEE HEADLIGHTS VEERING TO THEIR SIDE OF THE
          STREET.

          BOTH MEN DROP THEIR HANDS TO THEIR GUNS. Linga steps in
          front of Mandela, shielding him, Jason steps out wide, ready
          for anything.
                         
          Mandela is completely calm. The van screeches to a halt just
          past them.
                         
          A GUY jumps out of the van holding a tied BUNDLE OF
          NEWSPAPERS, which he drops with a thump at the grocery door.
          The guy doesn't see them. The delivery van is gone before
          the newspapers stop moving.
                         
          Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the
          headlines.
                         
          Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do
          not relax. These are dangerous times.
                         
          GO IN ON THE TOP NEWSPAPER, which shows a PHOTO OF THE
          INAUGURATION, and the following words, in Afrikaans: HE CAN
          WIN AN ELECTION, BUT CAN HE RUN A COUNTRY?
                         
                          JASON
           What does it say?
                         
                          MANDELA
           It says, "He can win an election,
           but can he run a country?"
                         
                          LINGA
                          (DISGUSTED)
           Not even one day on the job and
           they're after you.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It's a legitimate question.
                         
          Mandela turns and marches for home. Jason and Linga fall in
          behind him. In the east, the first milky hint of day.

          the KITCHEN STAFF sets a single place at the head of a big,
          formal dining table.
                         
          A LADY CHEF stirs the porridge, a KITCHEN ASSISTANT cuts
          fresh fruit.
                         
          Mandela's PERSONAL SECRETARY, MARY marches out of her small
          office with a STACK OF CORRESPONDENCE AND FIVE NEWSPAPERS,
          places them neatly next to the table setting.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
          Outside, Mandela is surrounded by men. Inside, he has
          surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages,
          to make up for twenty seven years without.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          MANDELA SHAVES UPSTAIRS IN THE BATHROOM. The razor is dull.
                         
          Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer
          that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and
          shedding tiny colored beads.
                         
          Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
          looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
          warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
          all the time.
                         
          But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
          that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
          face.
                         
          This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in
          the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey
          has marked his very soul.
                         
          Expressionless, Mandela shaves himself with the dull razor.

          mansions, PEOPLE START THEIR DAY.

           that range from economic stagnation
           and unemployment to rising crime --
                         
          Some start the day with a tea tray placed next to their beds
          by discreet black hands, some with nothing more than brown
          river water and half a fire-blackened ear of corn for
          breakfast.

                          TV ANNOUNCER
           -- with white fears.
                         
          Click! The TV is turned off by MR. PIENAAR (late 40's) in
          his very modest, blue-collar house.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
                          (GLOOMY)
           I never thought I'd see the day.
                         
          Mr. Pienaar turns and addresses his son, FRANCOIS PIENAAR,
          27, a big, blond, almost-handsome man with a fighter's face
          and mangled ears. Brutal toughness and honor in his
          features. A powerful physical presence, possibly dangerous.
          Francois drips with sweat, wears running clothes. Whatever
          he does, he is strong, fit and driven.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           I feel sorry for you, son. You've
           got your whole life ahead of you.
           What's it going to be like now?
                         
          MRS. PIENAAR (late 40's) enters holding some kind of PROTEIN
          SHAKE for Pienaar.
                         
           MRS. PIENAAR
           Don't be so gloomy.
           (handing over shake)
           I added vitamins -- there's a
           horrible flu bug going around.
           Tell Nerine when you get home.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Thanks, ma.
                         
           MR. PIENAAR
           I'm telling you, Francois -- look
           at Angola, look at Mozambique.
           Look at Zimbabwe. We're next.
           They're going to take our jobs and
           drive us into the sea. Just you
           wait.

          EXT. UNION BUILDINGS, PRETORIA - DAY
                         
          Magnificent, sweeping government buildings made of carved
          African field stone, with an Italian tiled roof, situated on
          a hill overlooking Pretoria. The seat of power.
                         
          Today, the entrance is mobbed with a huge, joyous, multi-
          racial throng, plus news crews from all over the world. Lots
          of new South African flags evident.
                         
          We move through the throng and swoop up into the air, so that
          we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK
          THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state --
                         
          -- where people who worked for the De Klerk regime are
          packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the
          Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little
          old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of
          grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the
          offices are already deserted.
                         
          The deserted offices have open doors. Through a window,
          through an open door, we see Mandela and his bodyguards
          striding down a Union Building hallway.
                         
          We swoop in through the window --
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
                         
          -- and catch up with the new President. Mandela is regal in
          a magnificent tailored suit. Jason in front, Linga behind.
                         
          PORTRAITS of the architects and champions of apartheid look
          down sternly on them as they pass.
                         
          They pass a WORKER hanging a PORTRAIT OF MANDELA next to one
          of De Klerk, the previous President.
                         
          ON LINGA, as he smiles at that.
                         
          Mandela, on the other hand, looks into the empty offices, and
          into the offices being packed up.
                         
          Up ahead, the double doors to the OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT,
          are closed. Jason speeds up, opens them, pokes his head in,
          then opens the doors wide.
                         
                          JASON
           (with great pride)
           After you, Mr. President.

          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
                         
          Mandela's offices are fronted by a LARGE RECEPTION AREA,
          already filled with PEOPLE WAITING TO SEE HIM.
                         
          To one side are his CHIEF OF STAFF'S SUITE of offices, to the
          other side, the SMALL PRESIDENTIAL SECURITY OFFICE.
                         
          Beyond these are MANDELA'S SECRETARIES, TYPISTS AND
          ASSISTANTS -- his gatekeepers.
                         
          Beyond that is the inner sanctum, MANDELA'S OWN OFFICE.
                         
          The phones are ringing off the hook. Fax machines are
          chattering. Everyone wants a piece of Mandela.
                         
          Mandela enters, Jason and Linga behind him.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good morning everybody.

          BARBARA MASEKELA, Mandela's CHIEF OF STAFF (and now
          Ambassador to the U.S.), emerges from her office, carrying an
          arm load of files, folders and papers --
                         
                          MANDELA
           Barbara, good morning. You've had
           your hair done. I like it.
                         
          -- accompanies Mandela back towards his office.
                         
                          BARBARA
           Thank you, Madiba. We need to talk
           about your cabinet appointments and
           ministers.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Give me one moment, please.
                         
          Barbara waits outside Mandela's office, as he enters ahead of
          her.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Mandela stands in the middle of his office, takes a moment to
          savor where he is.

          Then, he takes off his jacket, hangs it up and is ready for
          work.

          INT. UNION BUILDING STAFF DINING ROOM - DAY
                         
          What's left of the UNION BUILDING STAFF are packed into the
          DINING ROOM. White faces, bitter and resentful. Waiting to
          be fired.
                         
          Through the glass doors, THEY SEE MANDELA APPROACHING DOWN
          THE HALLWAY, Linga and Jason with him.
                         
                          STAFF MEMBER#1
           Here he comes.
                         
                          STAFF MEMBER#2
           He wants the satisfaction of firing
           us himself.
                         
          They stand up straight, determined to receive the ax with
          pride.
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING HALLWAYS - DAY
                         
          Linga and Jason amp up when they see the room full of
          restless Afrikaners. At the STAFF DINING ROOM DOOR, Mandela
          turns to them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I'd like you to stay out here,
           please.

           I cannot talk to them if I'm hiding
           behind men with guns.
                         
          Mandela opens the doors and enters. Jason and Linga stay
          outside ... just.
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING DINING ROOM - DAY

                          (ASIDE)
           Does he think greeting us in
           Afrikaans makes this any sweeter?
                         
                          MANDELA
           Some of you may know who I am.
                         
          This gets a few bitter chuckles. Mandela is at this best
          just talking to people, like this. Only, he doesn't just
          talk to them, he wades in amongst them, shaking hands and
          making individual contact as he speaks to all of them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good morning ... how are you ...
           thank you for coming at such short
           notice ... etc.
                         
           QUICK CUT TO:
                         
          Mandela is a continual security nightmare. You can see the
          tension on Jason and Linga's faces as he disappears into the
          throng.
                         
                          BACK TO:
                         
          When Mandela reaches the middle of the room, he stops shaking
          hands, and turns slowly as he talks to everybody.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I couldn't help noticing the empty
           offices as I came to work today.
           And all the packing boxes.
                         
          One black man, surrounded by a throng of serious white faces.

           Now, of course, if you want to
           leave, that is your right. And if
           you feel in your heart that you
           cannot work with your new
           government, then it is better that
           you do leave, right away.

           But if you are packing up because
           you fear that your language, or the
           color of your skin, or who you
           served previously, disqualifies you
           from working here now, I am here to
           tell you, have no such fear.

          Mandela pauses, to look at the faces. They are receptive.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I ask only that you do your jobs to

          Jason and Linga are right outside the glass doors, looking in
          and listening. Jason shakes his head.
                         
                          JASON
           He wants to win them over, one damn

          Mandela heads back through to his office, Barbara, Mary and
          other assistants forming a phalanx around him. Linga peels
          off, goes into the security office.
                         
          Jason stands at the desk of one of the assistants (JESSIE),
          waits for her to finish a call, then:
                         
                          JASON
           Molo, sister.

          Jason grins.
                         
                          JASON
           When you get a chance, can we see
           the schedule for the month? We
           need to plan security.
                         
          Jessie's phone rings.

                          (ANSWERING PHONE)
           Office of the President, good
           morning.
                         
          Jessie waves Jason off. He crosses to the security office,
          enters.
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Once he closes the door behind him, Jason shows his fatigue.
          Linga is feet-up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee.
          Three more bodyguards -- SAM, KWEZI and WINSTON -- slump in
          chairs.
                         
          Jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a
          groan.
                         
                          JASON
           We need more men.

                          JASON
           Yesterday.

          A knock at the door.
                         
                          JASON
           That's Jessie, with the schedule.
                          (LOUDLY)
           Come in, beautiful.
                         
          The door opens -- but what enters is not beautiful.
                         
          FOUR BIG WHITE COPS in suits enter, Special Branch written
          all over them. ETIENNE VAN ECK, HENDRICK BOOYENS, GEORGE and
          WILLEM.
                         
          The bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their
          territory.
                         
                          JASON
           What is this?
                         
                          ETIENNE

                          JASON
           That's me. Am I under arrest?
                         
          Etienne snaps out a crisp salute.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Captain Van Eck and team reporting
           for duty, sir.
                         
          Hendrick, George and Willem snap out salutes. Their military
          deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body
          language of the black bodyguards.
                         
                          JASON
           What duty?
                         
                          ETIENNE
           We're the Presidential bodyguard.
           We've been assigned to this office.
           (holding out a sheet of
                          PAPER)
           Here are our orders.
                         
          Jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly
          angry.
                         
                          LINGA
                          (TO HENDRICK)
           You're Special Branch, right?

          Hendrick nods, sternly. Linga, Sam, Kwezi and Winston react
          to that -- there is a long and brutal history between them
          and the Special Branch.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           You'll see that they've been
           signed.
                         
                          JASON
           I don't care if they're signed or --
                         
          Jason does a double-take when he sees the signature on the
          orders: NELSON R. MANDELA.
                         
                          JASON
           Wait here.
                         
          Jason storms out, holding the orders. The four black
          bodyguards seethe with hostility. The four white bodyguards
          stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.

          Mandela and Barbara look over a position paper on something
          or other. When Jason knocks and enters, they pause.
                         
                          JASON
           Sorry to disturb you.

                          JASON
           That's because I've got four
           Special Branch cops in my office.
                         
                          MANDELA
           What have you done?
                         
                          JASON
           Me? Nothing. They say they're the
           Presidential bodyguard. They have
           orders.

           Yes. They've had special training,
           those boys -- with the SAS. And
           lots of experience. They protected
           De Klerk.

                          MANDELA

           Reconciliation? Madiba, not long
           ago they tried to kill us! Maybe
           even these four guys. They tried
           and, often, they succeeded!

          Mandela stares at Jason in an entirely different way -- with
          wisdom, compassion and sympathy.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, I know.
                          (VERY GENTLY)
           Forgiveness starts here, too.
                         
          Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for
          something very difficult, but he demands it of himself to an
          even greater degree.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Forgiveness liberates the soul. It
           removes fear. That is why it is
           such a powerful weapon, Jason.

                          JASON
           Yes, Madiba. Sorry to disturb you.

          As Jason -- very upset -- walks back to security, Jessie
          holds out a file for him.
                         
                          JESSIE
           Two copies of the schedule.
                         
          Jason snatches the file, keeps walking.
                         
                          JESSIE
           Thank you, Jessie!
                         
          When he reaches the security office door, Jason walks right
          past, keeps going, has to make a full loop of the reception
          area, just to get himself together.
                         
          Even so, when he gets back to the security office door, Jason
          pauses, gathers himself to do something that he knows he's
          going to hate.

          Things haven't eased up one little bit inside the office.
          The silence is deafening. Jason enters, looks them all over.
          His face is grim.
                         
                          LINGA
           Can we get rid of these guys, now?
                         
          Jason flashes a look at Linga, then -- and this hurts him,
          visibly -- he holds out one of MANDELA'S SCHEDULES to
          Etienne.

          Linga and the others are shocked.

           We can't.

           This is what Madiba wants, okay.
                         
          Not okay for Linga, judging by the expression on his face.

          When Jason and Linga enter, Etienne looks up from Mandela's
          schedule.
                         
                          ETIENNE
           Are there any special orders or
           conditions?
                         
                          JASON
           No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you
           don't smile when you push people
           out of the way.

           The President's clan name. It's
           what we call him.
                         
          The new bodyguards share a look. They're not comfortable
          with "Madiba".
                         
                          ETIENNE
           We'll call him Mr. President.

           Let's get through this.
                         
          Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over
          Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's,
          at the month's schedule.
                         
          Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office.

          Etienne shakes his head.
                         
                          ETIENNE

           He says he rested enough in prison.
                         
          Jason recoils at something he sees on the last page of the
          schedule.
                         
                          JASON

          A huge, raucous crowd, almost entirely white and male. Many
          wearing the Springbok green and gold. Widespread evidence of
          drinking.
                         
          Lots of OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS -- the blue, white and orange
          apartheid flag -- make a defiant statement against the NEW
          SOUTH AFRICAN FLAGS ringing the stadium.
                         
          On the field, THE RUGBY TEAMS ASSEMBLE and face each other in
          two lines. The BRITISH LIONS in their white on white with
          black and red trim, the SPRINGBOKS in their green and gold.
                         
          Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for
          one man, who is "colored" (mixed race).

          Big, tough, brutal-looking men. Scary. (We may or may not
          notice Francois Pienaar, standing at the head of the line of

          At the entrance of the tunnel onto the field, LOTS OF COPS in
          blue South African Police uniforms.
                         
          Behind the line of cops, in the tunnel, we find JASON AND ALL
          THE OTHER BODYGUARDS but for Linga. They are keyed-up,
          intense -- none more so than Jason.

           I want your eyes on the crowd at
           all times. We're staying in the
           middle of the field. He's going to
           walk out, shake hands, walk back.
           Nothing else. Got it?
                         
          They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the
          stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel,
          straightens up.
                         
                          JASON
           Here we go.
                         
          Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark
          suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with
          excitement.
                         
          One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga.
                         
          Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods.
                         
          We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
                         
                         
          EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
                         
          -- onto the field, towards the waiting teams.
                         
          The crowd rise to their feet. Lots of them jeer Mandela,
          lots cheer. All the old South African flags are waved at him
          defiantly -- plus some new ones.
                         
          Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. To him, a crowd
          is an opportunity to make new friends. But he stays in the
          center of the field.
           23.
                         
                         
                         
          Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela.
                         
          Mandela reaches the rugby players.
                         
          Waiting for him at the head of the Springbok line, wearing
          the NUMBER 6 JERSEY and captain's armband, is FRANCOIS
          PIENAAR. Now we know what he does.
                         
          Mandela extends his hand.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good luck, captain.

                          (SHAKING HANDS)
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then
          returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick,
          perfunctory handshakes.
                         
          As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the
          crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play
          rugby.
                         
          Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk
          along the center of the field, back to the tunnel.
                         
          Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is
          about to blow.
                         
          Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
                         
          MANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE
          NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM.
                         
          WITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards
          this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps
          current -- enemies.

          With his bodyguards scrambling to stay in position, Mandela
          reaches the stands, hand outstretched, leans into the crowd.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Thank you for honoring our new
           flag!
                         
          Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not.
                         
          The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is
          delaying the rugby.
                         
          Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach.
          He turns, looks for more hands to shake --
                         
          -- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd.
                         
                          JASON

           Oh, yes, of course.
                         
          Mandela gives one last wave, turns away.
                         
          As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the
          stands.
                         
          Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late.
                         
          AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on
          the field.
                         
          Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile
          widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close
          around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.

          Jason stays in the tunnel, along with Etienne. Both men are
          in a muck sweat, adrenaline coursing through them.

          Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates
          the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked
          together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies
          under the watchful eye of the referee.
                         
          Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more
          glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
                         
          The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the
          scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum
          force.
                         
          The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the
          scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out
          laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
                         
          The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
          Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
          bounces erratically --
                         
          -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
          burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,
          and the wing scores in the corner.
                         
          As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find
          the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on
          their hips, stunned.
           26.
                         
                         
                         
          At the center of the huddle Pienaar bleeds behind his gum
          guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his
          team.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Concentrate, dammit! Focus! We
           can beat these guys if we play our
           game, not theirs!
                         
          ON PIENAAR, as he realizes he is not getting through. There
          is dullness, shock in his player's eyes --
                         
          -- which all lift to the heavens as the CONVERSION KICK SOARS
          through the uprights.
                         
          We FOLLOW THE KICK as it drops past a GIANT SCOREBOARD.
                         
          STAY ON THE SCOREBOARD as it registers the conversion and
          shows the score: LIONS - 10 SPRINGBOKS - 0

          Mary pours tea at the back of the box. Linga stands two
          steps behind Mandela.
                         
          On Mandela's left, sits the PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY,
          a small man with a small man's ruthlessness and drive.

          Barbara makes notes.
                         
          Mandela lifts his BINOCULARS, but instead of looking at the
          rugby, he looks at the crowd.

          OLD SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG -- the apartheid flag. It is being
          held by the FOUR KHAKI-CLAD BOERS (FARMERS). Classic South
          African figures from the rural far north, they are already
          drunk and suicidally depressed by the turn of events on the
          field.

           blacks are cheering for the Lions.

           We did that on the island, you

          He stomps out of the box, no doubt looking for someone to
          fire. Mandela gets back to work.

          The MINISTER OF SPORT (Steve Tshwete), enters.

          The Lions celebrate. The Springboks head off the field,
          heads down, shoulders bowed in defeat -- none more bitterly
          disappointed or bloodier than Francois Pienaar.

          No after-match party this night. Still depressed by the
          loss, Pienaar stays home with this fiancee NERINE.

           Pienaar's team played without
           discipline, without strategy and
           without courage.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           He's trying to get them to drop me.
                         
                          NERINE
           He's just bitter because the
           Springboks were boycotted when he
           played.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Maybe, but people listen to what he
           says.

          Wearing pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers, Mandela multi-
          tasks, watching Boland Botha and going through a pile of
          correspondence, scribbling notes or signing his name.
                         
           BOLAND BOTHA (ON TV)
           They brought shame upon our nation,
           and I, for one, can say without
           fear of contradiction, that today,
           these fifteen so-called men did not
           deserve to wear the hallowed green
           and gold.
                         
          ON MANDELA: a thought, an idea -- a big one -- is churning in
          his head. He grunts, turns off the TV, puts the
          correspondence aside, stands.
                         
          Mary enters with a glass of milk and some pills, on a tray.
                         
                          MARY
           Here's your muti. I warmed the

          Mandela pauses, between pills.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Did she say why?
                         
                          MARY
           No, she didn't.
           (making it up)
           She said to tell you she was sorry.
                         
          Mandela nods, has a hard time swallowing his last pill.
                         
                          MARY
           Do you need anything else tonight?
                         
                          MANDELA
           No, thank you. I'm going to bed.
           Good night.
                         
                          MARY
           Good night, Madiba. Sleep well.
                         
          Mandela smiles at her, but as soon as he is past her, the
          smile fades. As he climbs the stairs to his bedroom, his
          face becomes sadder and older and lonelier.
                         
          IN HIS BEDROOM, Mandela pauses to take off his dressing gown.
          He looks at his bed. It is as smooth and as blank as a sheet
          of paper.
                         
          He peels back the bedclothes at one corner, slides under them
          and pauses for a moment while reaching for the light switch.
          He switches off the light and lies down, still and straight.

          A very poor township outside Johannesburg. A stark reminder
          of how much work Mandela has ahead of him. A STAMPEDE OF
          KIDS runs by.
                         
          We FOLLOW THE KIDS and find a SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH. A noisy
          LINE OF THREADBARE KIDS leads from outside into the church.
          There is a pecking order in the line, based on size.

          INT. SMALL, BEAT-UP CHURCH - DAY
                         
          At a table near the altar, the kids rummage through bags of
          second-hand clothes under the watchful eye of MRS. COLEMAN, a
          stout and charitable woman. Next to her, MRS. DLAMINI hands
          out a lollipop and says --
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           God bless you.
                         
          -- to each kid. The clothes and lollipops move fast, rhythm
          kept by Mrs. Dlamini's "God bless yous".
                         
          The last bag of clothes empties fast as the line of kids
          reduces until there is only ONE SMALL BOY (SIPHO) left and
          only one article of clothing. An old SPRINGBOK RUGBY
          PRACTISE JERSEY. Green and gold.
                         
          Sipho could use it. His clothes are more holes than anything
          else. He looks at the Springbok jersey mournfully.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           You're a very lucky boy. It's a
           real Springbok practise jersey!
           It's a bit big, but it's warm and
           it'll last for ever!
                         
          Sipho shakes his head.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           It's yours, take it! Go on.
                         
          Sipho turns and leaves. Mrs. Coleman looks at Mrs. Dlamini,
          completely confused.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           Why won't he take it?
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           If he wears it, the others will
           beat him up.
                         
           MRS. COLEMAN
           Because the Springboks are playing
           so badly?
                         
           MRS. DLAMINI
           No. Because, for them, the
           Springboks still represent
           apartheid.

          Today it is the location of a full membership meeting of the
          National Sports Council, an ANC organization that is now the
          governing body of all sports in South Africa.

                          NSC FIREBRAND

           the apartheid era, the colors,
           emblem and name of the Springboks
           be eliminated immediately ...
                         
          That causes a stir. The delegates understand how big this
          is.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND

           representing South Africa shall be
           known forthwith as the Proteas.
                         
          Excitement and noise level rises. The NSC Firebrand has to
          shout through his mike.

          The NSC firebrand shoots his clenched fist into the air.
          With a roar, the delegates respond, raising their fists.
          Unanimous. The Springboks are history.

           them see that.
                         
          Mandela leans forward to talk to Linga.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Can you tell the boys that Madiba
           wants to go to Eersterust, very
           fast.
                         
          Linga murmurs into his radio. The convoy pulls out, very
          fast. Barbara makes one last plea.
                         
                          BARBARA
           You're risking your political
           capital. You're risking your
           future as our leader.
                         
                          MANDELA
           The day I am afraid to do that is
           the day I am no longer fit to lead.
                         
                          BARBARA
           At least risk it for something more
           important than rugby.
                         
          Mandela looks out the window, says nothing, angry.
                         
                         
          EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
                         
          Mandela's convoy heads away from Pretoria, very fast.
                         
           NSC FIREBRAND (V.O.)
           ... and in concluding this historic
           conference ...
           39.

                          NSC FIREBRAND
           ... brothers, sisters, comrades, we
           in the executive applaud your
           diligence and courage.
                         
          The NSC Firebrand and the executive applaud the members. The
          applause spreads until the hall rocks. They are all very
          pleased with themselves.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. EERSTERUST - CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
                         
          Mandela's convoy roars in. Mandela is the first one out,
          Linga next.
                         
          Jason and crew scramble to cover the immediate area.
                         
          Kwezi opens the door for Barbara on the other side.
                         
          Mandela strides over to Jason, says something to him. Jason
          looks surprised, turns to Hendrick.
                         
          Linga's customary scowl intensifies.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE HALL - DAY
                         
          As the applause finally begins to diminish, the NSC Firebrand
          turns and nods to a CHURCH CHOIR DIRECTOR, off to the side.
                         
          The choir director brings his CHOIR onto the stage.
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           Brothers, sisters ... join us in
           our anthem.
                         
          Anyone not standing, stands. The choir director raises his
          hands. The choir inhales. Go.
                         
                          CHOIR
                          (SINGING)
           Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrica etc (God
           Bless Africa) --
                         
          But before the first line is fully sung, an ASSISTANT rushes
          out, whispers urgently into the NSC Firebrand's ear.
           40.
                         
                         
          The Firebrand's eyes bug out in surprise. He crosses to the
          Choir Director, says something quickly.
                         
          The Choir Director stops the choir in mid-chorus.
          Consternation everywhere. What's going on?
                         
                          NSC FIREBRAND
           Brothers, sisters, members of the
           choir -- we would only interrupt
           such beautiful music for something
           truly important. In this case, for
           someone truly important.
           (beat, milking it)
           Please welcome President Mandela!
                         
          The place goes berserk as Mandela enters, with Linga at his
          back, and -- surprise, surprise -- Hendrick Booyens leading
          the way.
                         
          Face stern and unsmiling, Mandela walks the length of the
          hall towards the podium. The delegates press in towards
          them.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE - Jason coordinates security inside and out.
          Lifts his radio to his mouth.
                         
                          JASON
                          (INTO RADIO)
           Smile.
                         
          ON HENDRICK, as his standard bad bastard scowl suddenly
          becomes a smile -- which scares the throng more than the
          scowl did.
                         
          ON LINGA, the same.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE - Barbara enters at the back of the hall,
          accompanied by Kwezi.
                         
          Mandela reaches the podium, turns looks out over the crowd,
          face thunderous.
                         
          When they see his anger, the crowd quietens down quickly.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Brothers, sisters, comrades, I am
           here because I feel strongly that
           you made a decision today without
           sufficient information or
           foresight.
                         
          He lectures them like a headmaster. They don't like it.
           41.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           I am aware of your earlier vote. I
           am aware that it was unanimous.
                          (BEAT)
           Nonetheless, I propose that we
           restore the Springboks. Restore
           their name, their emblem and their
           colors, immediately.
                         
          Instant and complete silence in the hall. This is utterly
          unpopular. Shocked faces, especially from the executive and
          the NSC firebrand.
                         
          ON BARBARA, as she sees her worst political nightmare playing
          out in front of her.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Let me tell you why ...
                         
          Murmurs of disapproval and disagreement begin to rise.
          Mandela's going to have to row upstream on this one.
                         
                          MANDELA
           ... on Robben Island, in Pollsmoor
           Prison, my jailers were all
           Afrikaners.
                          (BEAT)
           For twenty seven years, I studied
           them. I learned their language, I
           read their history, I read their
           poetry. I had to know my enemy, in
           order to prevail against him.
                          (BEAT)
           And we prevailed, did we not? All
           of us here ... we prevailed.
                         
          For the first time, Mandela says something the crowd likes.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Our enemy is no longer the
           Afrikaner. They are our fellow
           South Africans, our partners in
           democracy.
                         
          Just as quickly, Mandela loses them again.
                         
                          MANDELA
           And they treasure Springbok rugby.
           If we take that away, we lose them.
           We prove that we are what they
           feared we would be.
                          (BEAT)
           We have to be better than that.
                          (MORE)
           42.
                         
                          MANDELA (CONT'D)
           We have to surprise them with
           compassion, with restraint, and
           generosity.
                         
          The grumbling and disagreement becomes noticeably louder.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, I know. All the things they
           denied us.
                         
          ON HENDRICK, totally engrossed in his job, eyes sweeping
          across the crowd, feeling the tension.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But this is not the time to enjoy a
           moment's petty revenge. This is
           the time to build our nation using
           every single brick available to us -
           - even if that brick comes clothed
           in green and gold.
                         
          The crowd is growing more restless and rebellious by the
          moment.
                         
          LINGA is as alert as Hendrick, tuned in to the jumpy vibe.
                         
                          MANDELA

           You elected me.
                          (BEAT)
           You elected me to be your leader.
           Let me lead you now.
                          (BEAT)
           Who is with me on this?
                         
          It's almost as if he's daring them to go against him.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Who is with me?
                         
          The murmuring becomes a dull roar of argument and
          disagreement.
                         
          ON BARBARA as she closes her eyes and lowers her head: this
          is a fiasco.

          convoy leaves as fast as it arrived. It almost looks as if
          they're fleeing.

          Silence. Mandela looks exhausted, almost gaunt. Facing his
          own people like that took it out of him. Barbara stares out
          the window, chewing her lip, totally stressed out.
                         
          Linga heaves a great sigh, exhales a truckload of stress.

          Barbara snorts disagreement. She is angry at her boss.
                         
                          BARBARA
           I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
           problems everywhere we look.
           Housing, food, jobs, crime, our
           currency. You can't keep
           interrupting affairs of state to
           placate a minority.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But, I must. This minority still
           controls the army, the police, and
           the economy. Without them, we
           cannot address the other problems.

           So this rugby, it's just a
           political calculation?
                         
          Life and energy, flood back into Mandela. He sits up against
          his seat belt, faces his Chief of Staff.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It's a human calculation.

           If we take away what they cherish --
           the Springboks, their national
           anthem -- we just reinforce the
           cycle of fear between us.
                         
          ON LINGA, in the front seat. He's not supposed to listen --

          The sound of cleats approaching on concrete. Exhausted
          footsteps. The DRESSING ROOM ATTENDANT PUTS CASES OF BEER
          (cans) on a side table, rips them open, backs away --
                         
          -- as the Springboks enter silently, faces miserable,

          One of the players grabs a beer, opens it, takes a gigantic
                         SWIG --
                         
                          ANGRY SPRINGBOK
           This beer tastes like kuk.

          sending foaming beer everywhere.
                         
          ON PIENAAR as his eyes flash and he shoots to his feet.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           It's not the beer.
                         
          Pienaar picks up a case of beers, goes to the angry
          Springbok.

           Everybody take a beer.
                         
          This is an order. The entire team takes a beer, including
          Pienaar.

           A toast ...
                         
          Pienaar cracks his beer, raises it up. They all crack and
          raise their beers.
                         
                          PIENAAR

                          PIENAAR
           Drink it. Remember it. And
           promise yourself never to taste it
           again.
                         
          Pienaar takes one long swig --
                         
                          PIENAAR
           You're right. It tastes like kuk.
                         
          -- tosses his beer against the wall, so that it ruptures.
          Eighteen other beers rupture against the wall. The dressing
          room is awash with beer and foam -- and re-kindled passion.
                         
          As with Mandela, Pienaar is a leader, on a smaller scale.

          security guards.
                         
          QUEEN ELISABETH and Mandela emerge from the palace. Footmen
          open doors on both sides of the carriage. The Queen and
          Mandela climb in (the Queen on the right hand side).
                         
          When they sit down next to each other, Mandela leans over and

           about them.

          THE RAND FALLING, THE MANDELA HONEYMOON OVER etc. etc.
                         
          Like any other man, Mandela turns to the SPORTS SECTION for
          relief -- and finally finds something to smile about.

           When I worked for the previous
           President, it was my job to be
           invisible.
                         
          Hendrick opens the door.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           This President ... he found out I
           like English toffee and brought me
           some back, from his visit to the
           Queen.
                         
          Hendrick ushers Pienaar into Mandela's offices.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           To him, nobody is invisible.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
                         
          Hendrick gestures to the waiting area.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           That's where you wait. One of his
           assistants will come for you.
                          (POINTING)
           There's a bathroom over there, if
           you need it.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Okay. Thanks.
                         
          Hendrick turns to leave, hesitates, turns back.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           What are our chances in the World
           Cup? I mean, for real.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           We'll do our best. That, I can
           guarantee.
                         
          Hendrick nods solemnly, heads back to security. Pienaar
          heads straight for the bathroom.

          Hendrick enters. Etienne and the other white bodyguards look
          up.
           58.
                         
                         
                         
                          HENDRICK
           Well, he's not as big as he looks
           on TV.
                          (BEAT)
           And we don't stand a bloody chance
           in the World Cup.
                         
                         
          INT. UNION BUILDING BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Pienaar washes his hands, dries them, dries them again, combs
          his hair, looks at himself in the mirror, adjusts his blazer.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICES - DAY
                         
          Pienaar returns to the waiting area, sits.
                         
          There is a clock on the wall. One minute to four.
                         
          Four Japanese trade officials traipse out, having just met
          Mandela.
                         
          The second hand journeys up to vertical. When it hits 4
          o'clock exactly --
                         
          -- Mary walks into the waiting area.
                         
                          MARY
           Mr. Pienaar?
                         
          Pienaar shoots to his feet.
                         
                          MARY
           This way, please.
                         
          Mary leads Pienaar back to Mandela's own office, knocks,
          opens the door.
                         
                          MARY
           Go on in.
                         
          Mouth dry, Pienaar nods --
                         
          -- and enters the inner sanctum.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Mandela leaps up from behind his desk, crosses the room to
          meet Pienaar.
           59.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           Francois, what an honor. I'm so
           excited.
                         
          They shake hands.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Thank you for coming all this way
           to see me.
                         
          Pienaar gulps like a fish out of water.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Yes, sir. No problem. Thank you
           for inviting me.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Tell me. How's your ankle?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           My ankle?
                         
                          MANDELA
           I was told you'd hurt it. Has it
           healed?
                         
          Pienaar relaxes, visibly. This is small talk he can handle.
          This is Mandela's gift.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           The truth is, sir, you never play
           at a hundred percent, no matter
           what.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes ... yes. In sports, and in
           life. Come. Sit. Please.
           (indicating a chair)
           Take this one. Looking into the
           light hurts my eyes.
                         
          They sit in the chairs.
                         
          A KNOCK at the door, and MRS. BRITS the old Afrikaner tea
          lady enters, carrying a laden tea tray.
                         
          Mandela stands again, immediately.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Ah, Mrs. Brits --
                         
          Pienaar stands just a beat slower.
           60.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           -- you are a shining light in my
           day.
                         
           MRS. BRITS
           Yes sir.
                         
          Eyes twinkling, Mrs. Brits puts the tea tray down on the
          coffee table in front of them. The finest china, cookies on
          a plate.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Mrs. Brits, this is Francois
           Pienaar. He's the captain of the
           Springboks.
                         
          Mandela clearly expects Pienaar to shake hands with Mrs.
          Brits. Pienaar holds out his hand --
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          (AFRIKAANS GREETING)
           Aangename kennis, Mevrou Brits.
                         
          -- gently shakes hers.
                         
           MRS. BRITS
           Ek ook, Meneer.
                          (TO MANDELA)
           Shall I pour, sir?
                         
                          MANDELA
           No thank you, I think I'd like to.
                         
          Mrs. Brits leaves. Mandela does not sit until the door
          closes behind her. Pienaar only sits after he does.
                         
          Mandela's manners would not be out of place in Victorian
          England.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do you take your tea, Francois?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Milk and sugar, please.
                         
          Mandela pours tea for both of them.
                         
          ON PIENAAR, as, just for a moment, he realizes that here he
          is, with the President pouring him a cup of tea.
           61.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           The English have given us many
           things, including rugby, but
           afternoon tea is one of the
           greatest.
                         
          Mandela hands Pienaar the tea cup.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          Both men have big hands. Fine china dwarfed and threatened.
                         
          In the exact moment that both their hands hold the same
          saucer, Mandela looks Pienaar in the eye.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You have a very difficult job.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           I do? I sell gas braais.
                         
          Mandela lets go and Pienaar takes the tea.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Captain of the Springboks. A very
           difficult job.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Not compared to yours, sir.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Ah, but then nobody is trying to
           tear my head off while I'm doing
           mine.
                         
          Pienaar grins. True.
                         
                          MANDELA
           It is not so difficult to get
           people to do their best. And I
           imagine that anybody who plays for
           their country does their best,
           almost automatically.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Or they wouldn't be chosen in the
           first place.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes. But to get people to be
           better than that?

           Better than they think they can be?
           Now, that is difficult, I find.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Yes sir, it is.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do we do that? By example? To
           an extent. But there is more to it
           than that ...
           (searching for the right
                          WORD)
           ... inspiration, perhaps.
                         
          Pienaar is engrossed. This is a master lesson on leadership,
          from a master.
                         
                          MANDELA
           How do we inspire ourselves to
           greatness, when nothing less will
           do? How do we inspire everyone
           around us?
                          (BEAT)
           Sometimes, I think, by using the
           work of others.
                         
          Long pause. Pienaar knows to keep quiet.

           On Robben Island, when things were
           very hard, I found inspiration in a
           poem.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           A poem?
                         
                          MANDELA
           A Victorian poem. Just words. But
           they helped me to stand when all I
           wanted was to lie down --

           But you didn't come all this way to

                          PIENAAR
           No! They make a lot of sense, sir.

           On the day of a big match, say a
           test, in the bus on the way to the
           stadium, nobody talks.

           Yes ... yes. Everybody is

                          PIENAAR
           When I think we're ready, I have
           the bus driver put on a song I've
           chosen; a theme song. One we all
           know. We listen together and ...
           it helps.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes! I remember when I was a guest
           at the 1992 Olympic Games in
           Barcelona. The whole stadium
           welcomed me with a song.
                          (BEAT)
           At the time the future -- our
           future -- seemed very bleak. But
           to hear that song, in voices from
           all over our planet ... it made me
           very proud to be South African. It

                          MANDELA
           Well, it was Nkosi Sikelel'
           iAfrika. A very inspiring song.
                         
          Mandela looks into Pienaar's eyes.
                         
                          MANDELA
           We need inspiration, Francois.
                         
          Brown African eyes, blue African eyes meet over their cups of

           Because, in order to build our

           own expectations.

          Pienaar walks away from the President's offices, still
          processing his meeting with Mandela. He seems a little
          stunned and mystified. Something profound just happened --
          but he's not quite sure what.

          When Pienaar steps outside and sees all of Pretoria -- all of
          South Africa -- stretching away below him, he pauses. He
          looks at his country in a new way.
                         
          A BEEP BEEP from Nerine's car interrupts his reverie, as she
          pulls up at the bottom of the stairs.

           met before.
                         
          An unsatisfying answer. Nerine waits for more. But, she
          isn't going to get it without prying it out of Pienaar.

          This is the question Pienaar is wrestling with, too. He
          thinks it over for long enough to drive Nerine crazy.
                         
                          NERINE
           Ag, come on Francois. It's like
           talking to a bloody brick wall.
           What did he want?

          -- on Mandela, who is surrounded by HIS GRANDCHILDREN IN THE
          LIVING ROOM. Mandela likes the babies. THEIR PARENTS, shoo
          and shepherd the kids, keeping them on their best behavior --
                         
          -- for the PHOTOGRAPHERS shooting this family gathering.
          Seeing the photographers makes this feel staged.
                         
          Mandela looks past the photographers, sees his daughter
          ZINDZI glancing in from the doorway, and then moving on.

          She is a modern, cosmopolitan young woman.

          a very Mandela-like grunt.

           Okay. I think he looks like one of
           the policemen who forced us out of
           our house when you were in jail. I
           don't like seeing you shake his
           hand. And I'm not the only one.
                         
          Mandela overreacts.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You criticize without
           understanding. You seek only to
           address your own feelings. This is
           selfish thinking. It does not

           Wait. Please. I --
                         
          Mandela wants to apologize, doesn't know how. Instead, he
          pulls AN ENVELOPE out of his pocket, holds it out.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Will you give this to your mother.
                         
                          ZINDZI

                          MANDELA
           A bracelet.
                         
          Zindzi looks into the envelope. In it is the BEADED
          BRACELET, from earlier, from the bathroom.
                         
                          ZINDZI
           Just throw it away.
                         
                          MANDELA

          Only children know how to twist the dagger so deftly.
          Mandela turns away so that his daughter cannot see his eyes.
                         
          A man so at ease with strangers does not know how to talk to
          his own family.

          Hands on their knees, sucking air, retching, the squad has
          worked their way down the full length of the field.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK MANAGER

          The squad can't believe their ears. No one moves. Except

           Come on boys, let's show him.
                         
          Staggering more than sprinting, Pienaar heads towards the 25m
          line.

          Alone in his office, Mandela looks at the World Cup diagram,
          for a moment, then picks up his phone.

          Thirty completely wiped-out athletes. Some are too tired to
          shower, some have made it that far, but are too tired to
          change.
                         
          Pienaar has showered and changed and slumps next to his
          locker.
                         
          The SPRINGBOK MANAGER enters, followed by the RUGBY

          Pienaar and the boys drag themselves upright.
                         
          The Rugby President looks them over as if they were his very
          own stable of race horses -- a stable he's not entirely sure
          he likes.

           Afternoon men. It's good to see
           you working so hard. I have a
           short announcement.
                          (BEAT)
           As part of the PR buildup to the
           World Cup, you will be conducting

          The players greet this announcement with complete silence.
                         
                          RUGBY PRESIDENT
           I know you have plenty on your

           (looking at Pienaar,
                          POINTEDLY)
           The very top.
                         
          The Rugby President turns on his heel, and leaves, followed
          by the Manager.
                         
          The players say nothing for a long moment, but body language
          alone shows that they are completely disgusted.

           We're looking at the remains of the
           Federal Building in Oklahoma City,
           America, which was destroyed today
           in a massive explosion.
                         
          PULL BACK to reveal that we are in Mandela's offices.
          Barbara, Mary, other assistants look on. So do the

          Mandela approaches slowly from his office, drawn in by the
          horrible, irresistible images. He stands behind his people.
                         
                          TV ANNOUNCER
           No one has claimed responsibility
           yet, but authorities say that the
           timing and target mark this as the
           work of white, right-wing fanatics.
           An act of revenge for the FBI
           killings in Waco, Texas.
                         
          Jason and Linga share a pointed look. South Africa is a

           The explosive, a truck bomb, was

           commonly available industrial and
           agricultural materials.

          At one edge we find what passes for a SOCCER FIELD. Just a

          many of them begging for cash and candy. SIPHO in the thick

          One of the Springbok management crew pulls a ROLLED BANNER on
          two spiked poles out of their van.
                         
          Mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the
          edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township
          kids.
                         
          They hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen
          from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to
          hammer the second pole into the ground --
                         
          -- except that there is a SMASHED BEER BOTTLE in the way.
          Broken glass everywhere.
                         
          They look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the
          field.
                         
          Broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.

          which wakes the sleeping Springboks.
                         
          They look out of the windows and see the absolutely hellish
          outskirts of the township. Every possible incarnation of

          this township.

          The driver sounds the horn again, and the kids on the field
          sprint for the bus, hands and pockets full of broken glass.
                         
                          PIENAAR

          EXT. TOWNSHIP - DAY
                         
          As the kids approach the bus, they dump their broken glass
          under the banner, which reads --
           77.
                         
                         
                         
           ONE TEAM, ONE COUNTRY
                         
          -- brown, green, white, blue shards tinkling and piling up,
          like lethal jewels, backlit in the low winter sun.
                         
          One of the big kids gets the R100. Attention focussed on
                         THAT --
                         
          -- until the bus door opens with a loud hiss of hydraulics
          and the Springboks exit, one by one.
                         
          Pienaar first, with a huge NET BAG OF PRACTISE BALLS over his
          shoulder.
                         
          The Springboks are all so big, so strong, so healthy, they
          look like gods, or aliens, emerging from a spaceship. The
          kids go quiet, awed and uncomfortable.
                         
          Until Chester Williams steps off the bus, and there is a
          collective sigh of recognition and wonder.
                         
          Now, the kids can relate to the Springboks. Even Sipho, who
          looks on from the side of the field.
                         
          Springbok management notes it.
                         
          The TV crews note it.
                         
          Pienaar notes it.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Okay Chester -- I reckon you're up.

           WHO WANTS TO PLAY RUGBY?
          A roar. They all do.
                         
          Pienaar opens the net bag full of rugby balls, gives a ball
          to Chester.
                         
                          PIENAAR

          Chester boots the ball out over the crowd, high and
          incredibly far in the thin winter air. (60 yards, easily.)
                         
          Pienaar tosses balls to the others.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Let's do our best.
                         
          One after another, the Springboks kick the balls high into
          the air.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Go get them!
                         
          The kids go after them. Sipho stays on the sideline.
                         
          BEGIN RUGBY CLINIC MONTAGE
                         
          Barely controlled chaos. Each Springbok works with one ball
          and a group of kids. There are THREE THEMES to this montage.
                         
          FIRST, a primer on the basic rules of rugby, with
          demonstrations.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           Who here knows the first rule of
           rugby?
                         
                          TOWNSHIP KID
           Me!
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           What is it?
                         
                          TOWNSHIP KID
           Only hit the other players when the
           ref isn't looking!
                         
          Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           No. The first rule of rugby is you
           can only pass the ball backwards or
           sideways.
                         
          Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are
          demonstrated.)
                         
                          VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS
           - If you drop the ball, or pass it
           forwards, you scrum for possession.
           - This is a scrum.
           - You kick forwards.
                          (MORE)
           79.
                         
           VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd)
           If you kick it out of bounds, you
           throw it back in to a lineout.
           - This is a lineout.
           - You score in four ways: a try,
           when you dot the ball down behind
           the try line. That's five points.
           - Another two points when you
           convert the try by kicking the ball
           through the uprights.
           - Three points for a penalty kick.
           - Three points for a drop kick.
           - Have you got all that?
                         
                          KIDS
           No!
                         
                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           Agh, bugger it, let's just run and
           pass. Whoever drops the ball does
           pushups!
                         
          SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it.
          Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy
          the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most
          conservative Springbok.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK LOCK
           Okay. Who wants to scrum against
           me?
                         
          One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them
          backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards.
          They love it, the cameras love it.
                         
          THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as
          the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is
          twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's
          basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming.
          The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow
          Pienaar.
                         
          AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at
          Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't
          just hold it, he feels it.
          END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a
          horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls
          under their arms.
                         
          One blast on the horn, one answering cheer from the kids and
          the bus slowly accelerates away.

          A cabinet meeting in the rainbow nation, with Mandela at the
          head of the table.
                         
          The MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT is making a presentation
          about a campaign to put an end to littering by plastic bags.
          Behind him is a VERY DRAMATIC SLIDE IMAGE of a rural barbed
          wire fence festooned with wind-blown plastic bags.
                         
           MINISTER OF THE ENVIRONMENT
           -- and in addition to the
           nationwide PR campaign, we propose
           that all retail outlets charge a
           nominal fee for plastic bags --
                         
          Mary enters quietly, slips a piece of paper in front of
          Mandela, who reads it, holds up his hand.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Mr. Minister, please forgive me.
           This sounds excellent, and we will
           return to it, but if you'll indulge
           me for just one minute --
                         
          Mandela nods to Mary, who switches on a big TV on the wall --
          which shows NEWS FOOTAGE OF THE COACHING CLINIC in the
          township.
                         
          When we see the FOOTAGE OF THE LOCK SCRUMMING WITH THE KIDS,
          Mandela laughs, delighted, turns to his cabinet.
                         
                          MANDELA
           You see, that picture is worth any
           number of speeches.

           Australian side in the Cup opener
           next week a tall order, especially
           since this is an inexperienced team
           with a history of coming up short
           in big matches. This is Boland
                          BOTHA --

           Around the world -- objectively --
           what are they saying about our
           chances against Australia?
                         
           MINISTER OF SPORT
           Everyone thinks they'll beat us.
           And if they do, we'll have to go
           through England and the All Blacks
           just to get to the Final.
                         
                          MANDELA
           So it is very important that we
           beat Australia.
           (to Minister of Sport)
           Thank you.

          Alone in his office, Mandela sits, thinks, gets a sheet of
          paper with his PERSONAL LETTERHEAD on it, uncaps his fountain
          pen.
                         
          OVER MANDELA'S SHOULDER, we see him write, and then
          underline, the title INVICTUS by W.E. Henley.

          From memory, Mandela writes the first line of the poem:

          Ahead, we see NEWLANDS STADIUM, home of the World Cup opener

          The entire Springbok squad has been on a training run through
          Cape Town, on ordinary streets, through ordinary people.
                         
          (This is unthinkable in top-level sports anywhere else. It

          When they are recognized, drivers toot their horns,
          pedestrians cheer, kids on bicycles ride with them (mostly
          still white).
                         
          As they approach the hotel grounds, Pienaar surges to the

          The players are relieved. Pienaar looks down at the sheet of
          paper for a moment, then looks up at the guys.

          African alcoholic enabling service). Lots and lots of booze.
                         
           BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
           How do you think the Springboks
           will do?
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           I think they will do very well.
           Their level of commitment is
           tremendous.

          THE SPRINGBOKS TRAIN on an isolated field at the SILVERMINE
          ARMY BASE outside Cape Town. Tactics and refinements, not
          fitness training.
                         
           BOLAND BOTHA (V.O.)
           Now, it's been said that you used
           to support any team who played
           against the Springboks.
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           Obviously, that is no longer true.
           I am one hundred percent behind our
           boys.
                         
          JASON, ETIENNE, LINGA and HENDRICK stand anxiously outside
          Newlands Stadium. One of them points to the top of a tall
          building nearby -- a Eureka! moment, for reasons we don't yet
          understand.
                         
          BACK TO THE STUDIO:
                         
                          MANDELA
           After all, if I cannot change when
           circumstances demand it, how can I
           ask others to?

          EXT. CAPE TOWN - DAY
                         
          A SOUTH AFRICAN DEFENSE FORCE HELICOPTER hovers over the tall
          building next to Newlands stadium.
                         
                         
          INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY
                         
          IN THE HELICOPTER, Mandela, Jason, Linga, all wearing radio
          headsets. All wearing suits, as if for a state occasion.
                         
                          JASON
                          (ON RADIO)
           We're going to land you on top of
           that building. We'll own the road
           between it and the stadium.
                         
          Mandela likes it.
                         
          Jason gives the pilot a nod and they take off down the
          peninsula towards Silvermine Army base.
                         
          FROM THE HELICOPTER, MANDELA LOOKS down at his country, and
          finds it good.
           90.

          Helicopter against spectacular scenery.
                         
                         
          INT. SADF HELICOPTER - DAY
                         
          Mandela points down. Jason and Linga look.
                         
          POV FROM THE AIR: They can see the Springboks practising
          right below them, on the army base.
                         
          Mandela pulls out the SPORTS SECTION with the Springbok team
          on it. His study guide. He takes a last minute glance at it
          as the helicopter loses altitude.
                         
                         
          EXT. SILVERMINE ARMY BASE - RUGBY FIELDS - DAY
                         
          Mandela's helicopter lands at the edge of the field, and
          brings practise to a halt.
                         
          ON COACH -- not happy, but what's he going to do.
                         
          Mandela springs out of the helicopter, energized, excited.
          Linga and Jason with him.
                         
          The players assemble in a loose, semi-formal unit. Not a
          line, but orderly. (We may or may not notice that Chester
          Williams is missing.)
                         
          Pienaar stands at the front, relaxed. He's an old hand with
          Mandela, by now.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Francois, gentlemen -- forgive me
           for interrupting your work the day
           before such an important match ...
                          (BEAT)
           ... I just wanted to wish you good
           luck, in person.
                         
          There is a naughty twinkle in Mandela's eye.
                         
                          MANDELA
           And sometimes, very seldom, as
           President, I am allowed to do what
           I want.
                         
          They all laugh.
           91.
                         
                         
                         
          Mandela wades in amongst them, leaving Linga and Jason
          behind.
                         
          Picture this: Behind the barbed wire security of a modern,
          South African military base, a tall, regal black man in his
          70's is surrounded by huge, sweating, battered, brutal-
          looking white men --
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          (DOING INTRODUCTIONS)
           Mr. President, this is --
                         
                          MANDELA
           I know who this is.
                          (SHAKING HANDS)
           Good luck, Andre.
           (shaking hands with all of
                          THEM)
           Good luck Brendan, we're behind you
           all. Japie -- etc
                         
          -- every single one of whose names he has committed to
          memory. Statesmanship is often about attention to detail.
                         
          The players are awe-struck.
                         
          (FOR THE RECORD: Andre, Gavin, James, Japie, Christiaan,
          Brendan, Hennie, Joel, Johan, Joost, Marius, James, Chris,
          Pieter, Garry, Mark, Kobus, Hannes, Krynauw, Ruben, Francois,
          Robby, Adriaan, Rudolf.)
                         
          CUT AWAY to Jason and Linga, who are amazed by what they're
          seeing.
                         
                          LINGA
           Did you ever imagine this?
                         
                          JASON
           How could I?
                         
          By the time Mandela has shaken every single player's hand, he
          has won the team over, coach and manager included. They
          glow.
                         
          And then, Mandela frowns, steps back, looks at all of them.
                         
                          MANDELA
           But where is Chester?
                         
          Pienaar doesn't answer immediately, he looks at his coach
          first. Coach nods.
           92.
                         
                         
                         
                          PIENAAR
           He's injured, sir. His hamstring.
           We're trying to keep it quiet.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Is he out for the whole tournament?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           With hamstrings, who knows?
                          (BEAT)
           We'll miss him.
                         
                          MANDELA
           The whole country will miss him.
                         
          A somewhat sour note to leave on. But it's about to be
          rescued.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK PROP
           Mr. President, sir --
                         
                          MANDELA
           Yes, Hennie.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK PROP
           -- this is for you. From us.
                         
          The huge, thick man holds out a GREEN CAP with gold piping
          and a Springbok leaping above the visor.
                         
          Mandela takes the cap as if he has just been given a holy
          relic.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I am honored. Truly honored.
                         
          Mandela runs his finger over the embroidered Springbok
          leaping across the front of the cap.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Good luck gentlemen. Your country
           supports you, completely.
                         
          The team applauds, beaming, glowing.
                         
          Mandela turns to go back to the helicopter.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Francois, walk with me.
                         
          Pienaar walks Mandela back towards the helicopter.
           93.
                         
                         
                         
                          MANDELA
           I have something for you.
                         
          Mandela reaches into his jacket, pulls out an ENVELOPE WITH
          THE PRESIDENT'S LETTERHEAD on it. Gives it to Pienaar.
                         
                          MANDELA
           This helped me, many times.
           Perhaps it will help you, too.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Pienaar holds the envelope, stares upwards at the rising,
          departing helicopter, as do the rest of the team -- until
          Coach blows his whistle.
                         
                          COACH
           Enough fun and games! We've still
           got work to do.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - SECURITY CENTER - NIGHT
                         
          Jason paces restlessly, going over his mental check list,
          making sure he hasn't missed anything.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S CAPE TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Mandela reads, scrawls comments, signs papers from a big "In"
          pile. Mary enters with his glass of milk and his pills.
                         
                          MARY
           It's time for bed.
                         
                          MANDELA
           I think I'll stay up a little
           longer. The country is excited
           tonight.
                         
                          MARY
           You need to sleep. The doctor
           said.
                         
                          MANDELA
           The doctor has no sense of
           occasion.
           94.
                         
                         
                         
          Mandela turns on the TV, begins flipping channels. Rugby,
          rugby, rugby. Mandela is sucked in.
                         
          Mary sighs.

          INT. COACH'S ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
                         
          The coach and the manager. Cats on a hot tin roof.
                         
                          COACH
           There's nothing more we can do.
           The game plan's good. It's just a
           matter of the boys executing it
           tomorrow.
                         
                          MANAGER
           That's Pienaar's job. It's in his
           hands, now.
                         
                         
          INT. PIENAAR'S ROOM - CAPE TOWN HOTEL - NIGHT
                         
          Room dark but for one small desk light. Pienaar stands at
          the window, looking out across Cape Town. He is deep in
          thought.
                         
          Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where,
          under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela
          wrote out by hand.
                         
          Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his
          door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine,
          accompanied by a cop.
                         
          Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter.
          As soon as the door closes behind her, Nerine says:
                         
                          NERINE
           You know the best thing about you
           being the captain?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Uh ... the honor?
                         
                          NERINE
           You don't have to share a room.
                         
          Nerine gives Pienaar a scorching kiss. He resists ... then
          responds -- then pulls away.
           95.

           Francois, come on. It's been
           weeks.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Uh uh. I need to be angry for
           tomorrow.
                         
          Nerine takes a deep breath, nods, turns away -- and sees the
          poem on Mandela's personal letterhead.
                         
                          NERINE
           What's this?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           A poem. From the President.
                         
                          NERINE
           How does a poem help you play
           rugby?
                         
                          PIENAAR
           The same way your visit does.
                          (BEAT)
           Inspiration.
                         
          OVER, REFEREE'S WHISTLE BLOWS HARD AND SHARP.
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
                         
          A massive crowd roars.
                         
          The Wallaby flyhalf runs forward, puts his boot into the
          ball, sends it soaring towards the waiting Springboks.
                         
          The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all
          sides, takes the ball out of the air perfectly --
                         
          -- just as the Wallaby pack closes in and huge men meet with
          an adrenaline-fueled crunch of bodies.
                         
          The World Cup has begun at last.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          But not for Chester Williams. Clad in Springbok blazer and
          tie, he sits behind the coach, the manager and the reserves,
          in the stands -- and almost succeeds in hiding his utter
          disappointment at not being on the field.
           96.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - VIP BOX - DAY
                         
          Mandela looks on, calmly. The Minister of Sport isn't late
          for this match. The President of Rugby is pale with nerves.
                         
          Behind Mandela, stand Linga and Hendrick. The VIP box is a
          safe place, but Jason isn't taking any chances.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
                         
          Jason prowls through the stadium, talking constantly on his
          radio. Hunter's adrenaline.

          INT./EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
                         
          Back to action on the field.
                         
          The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
          saw in the township. This continues the education of those
          who do not know rugby.
                         
          So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
          resulting scrum.
                         
          We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
          lineout.
                         
          We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
          strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
          and strong.
                         
          INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
                         
          -- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and
          lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all
          overseen by Jason) --
                         
          -- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test
          against the Lions, is completely and passionately united
          behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the
          extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
                         
          -- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something
          interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga
          Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his
          scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
           97.
                         
                         
                         
          When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the
          box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:
                         
                          LINGA
           What happened?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           They scored.
                         
          When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd
          roars, Linga asks again:
                         
                          LINGA
           What happened?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We scored.
                         
          A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
                         
                          HENDRICK
           They scored again.
                         
          A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
                         
                          LINGA
           We scored?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           Ja. We're tied.
                         
          A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We're up by three.
                         
          ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and
          forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line.
          Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the
          Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the
          assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.
                         
          A ripple of concern goes through the crowd --
                         
          -- and the VIP box.
                         
                          LINGA
           They're ahead?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           By four.
                         
          Nerves in the box.
           98.
                         
                         
                         
          But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle
          we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
                         
          -- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the
          Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking
          the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
                         
          The crowd roars.
                         
          In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with
          everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the
          waiter.
                         
          The difficult, angled conversion is missed.
                         
                          LINGA
           What does that mean?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We're only ahead by one.
                         
          Another penalty kick.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We're ahead by four.
                         
          A drop goal.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           By seven.
                         
          An incredible try by the Springbok fly half.
                         
                          HENDRICK
           By fourteen.
                         
          Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant
          for pessimism begins to abate.
                         
          Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows
          and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at
          the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this
          match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY
          HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.
                         
          SUDDENLY, A REFEREE'S WHISTLE CREATES PANDEMONIUM on the
          field, in the stands, and in the VIP box.
                         
                          LINGA
           What happened?
                         
                          HENDRICK
           We won!
           99.
                         
                         
                         
                          LINGA
           We did?
                         
          Mandela shoots to his feet, pushes his chair away and begins
          the famous "Mandela shuffle" -- a very cool African boogie
          that is one of his signature moves. ON THE MANDELA SHUFFLE --

          INT. VIP PARTY - NIGHT
                         
          -- the same shuffle hours later, at a VIP party. Mandela has
          changed clothes, wears one of his Indonesian-inspired "Madiba
          shirts" and dances energetically with the absolutely stunning
          TROPHY WIFE of one of the VIP's.
                         
                          TROPHY WIFE

                          MANDELA
           Indeed not. My father was a Xhosa
           chief, and therefore a polygamist.
           As you know, I am not.

           But when I look at you ... I envy

          The man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. But,
          once again, he is dancing with a stranger --
                         
          -- and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that
          Mandela is pushing himself way past empty.

          Big party, spilling onto the streets. Most of the partiers
          are white. Black South Africans look on, or serve drinks.
                         
          We follow the crowd into a big sports bar --
                         
                         
          INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          -- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off
          the steam of months of training grind, plus a huge win.
                         
          Even though most of the players are with their wives or
          girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three
          deep, men pay for round after round of beers.
                         
          Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets
          a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a
          chagrined look.
                         
          He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near
          the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
                         
                          PIENAAR
           COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS
           IT ON.
                         
          The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the
          player next to him, repeats it.
                         
          Pienaar watches the message travelling through his team --
          and grins.
                         
          Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead
          TV's.
                         
          ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The
          boogie is followed by a quick "How far we have come" type of
          montage. One of the images shows an island ringed by rough
          surf.
                         
          Pienaar gets an idea.

          Pienaar leads his hung-over, sleep-deprived team on a very
          slow jog through the mostly empty streets.

          When he gets to an intersection, he sneaks a peek down at the
          palm of his left hand.
                         
          CLOSE-UP ON PIENAAR'S HAND, where he has drawn a crude street

          The ferry pulls away from the waterfront, with the team on
          board, pulling on tracksuits against the cold sea air.
                         
          It is early winter. The seas are fairly rough.
                         
          So are the stomachs of the `boks who partied hard last night.

          glory.
                         
          Ahead of the ferry, one of the most notorious island prisons
          in modern history --
                         
          -- ROBBEN ISLAND.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
                         
          Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is
          two miles long, with sandy beaches full of penguins and
          seals. It would be pretty --
                         
          -- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed
          wire, guard towers.
                         
          (In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the
          island still housed criminal prisoners, so the island still
          had the feel of real incarceration. Today, it is a tourist
          destination.)
                         
                         
          EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY
                         
          As they approach the island, a sense of dark history settles
          over the Springboks and their partners.
                         
          One of the Springboks turns to a DECKHAND, getting ready to
          moor at the jetty.
                         
                          SPRINGBOK LOCK
           How do they bring the prisoners
           here?
                         
                          DECKHAND
           On this boat.
                         
          Sobering.
                         
                         
          EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
                         
          The Springboks and their partners step onto dry land with
          some relief, look around at the prison, humbled.

                          PIENAAR
           That would make it worse.
                         
          They head towards the prison entrance, slowly becoming a
          tighter and tighter bunch. The ghosts of Mandela, and all
          the others who spent much of their lives here, are very
          strong.

          Section B is the bleak political wing. Tiny cells line each
          side of a damp concrete hallway.
                         
          A PRISON GUARD shows the Springboks into the hallway, and
          they dwarf it, as they stand there, shocked. Shocked at what
          was done in their names. This group is as quiet as we have
          ever seen them.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Can we see the President's cell?
                         
                          PRISON GUARD
           Yes, of course.
           (leading them down past
                          THE CELLS)
           We've done it up just the way it
           was.
                         
          They reach a cell with a piece of white cardboard on the
          door, showing the number 466/64 -- MANDELA'S PRISON NUMBER.
                         
                          PRISON GUARD
           (pointing at the number)
           That means he was the 466th
           prisoner admitted in 1964.
                         
          The Prison Guard unlocks the door, pulls it open, then
          unlocks the metal grill that is the inside door.

          INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
                         
          Pienaar peers into the cell. It is tiny. There is no bed,
          just a sisal mat on the concrete floor, with a couple of
          blankets. A chamber pot, a short bench, a tin cup and plate
          are the only other objects in the room.
                         
          A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The
          barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow
          the prisoner a view.
                         
          When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He
          can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.
                         
          This is a bleak, horrible, dehumanizing place. Pienaar is
          stunned by it. He turns, slowly, looking at Mandela's world
          for over twenty years.

          The other Springboks and their partners wait to look into the
          cell themselves, a little puzzled by how much time Pienaar's
          taking.
                         
                         
          INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
                         
          Pienaar almost looks as if he is in a trance. He hears
          Mandela's voice in the cell with him.
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
                          (RECITING "INVICTUS")
           Out of the night that covers me,
           Black as the pit from pole to pole,
           I thank whatever gods may be
           For my unconquerable soul.
                         
          Now, Pienaar sees Mandela in prison clothes, in the cell.
          (The image is unclear, ghostly.)
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           In the fell clutch of circumstance
           I have not winced nor cried aloud.
           Under the bludgeonings of chance
           My head is bloody, but unbow'd.
                         
          Pienaar sees Mandela sitting on the dirt in the prison yard,
          breaking up rock with a hammer, along with rows of other
          political prisoners.

           Looms but the Horror of the shade,

          Pienaar sees Mandela leading his fellow prisoners to the lime
          quarry, to mine lime under the eye of a guard who looks like
          Pienaar.
                         
           MANDELA (V.O.)
           It matters not how strait the gate,
           How charged with punishment the scroll,
           I am the master of my fate:
           I am the captain of my soul.

          Barbara enters. The sight of Mandela lying like this is
          chilling. It is too close to what he would look like lying
          in a casket.
                         
          Barbara makes sure he is breathing. He is. She unplugs his
          phone, takes it. Unplugs his TV. Sweeps the room for
          papers, articles, legal briefs. For the first time, she
          takes an arm load of stuff away from him. She gives Mandela
          one last, long look, closes the door behind her.
                         
          We stay behind and look at Mandela, and ponder South Africa's

          score ON THE WORLD CUP BRACKET DIAGRAM: SOUTH AFRICA 42,
          WESTERN SAMOA 14. The diagram shows us that this was a
          quarter final match.

          Barbara and Mary stand next to Mandela at the window.
          Mandela's eyes twinkle with pleasure as he hears the
          laughter. In a way, this small moment already justifies
          everything he has done. Almost.
                         
          He gives Barbara a sly look.
                         
                          MANDELA

          Before Barbara can reply, excitement on the TV makes Mandela
          turn away. He looks at the TV just as Lomu scores his fourth
          try, to make it 42 - 15. Mandela shakes his head, awed.

           It's a new international record.

           They beat Scotland 48 to 30 in the

          Light from the hallway hits the bed. Mandela looks very
          still under the covers.
                         
          Mary peers in, concern wiping away sleep. She sees Mandela
          lying there. Mary tiptoes in, concern growing, until she
          stands over Mandela --

          looks over the newspaper headlines, all screaming about
          today's World Cup final.
                         
          The doorbell rings, and he pauses, listens to the sound of
          voices at the door -- then the sound of heavy footsteps
          approaching through the house.
                         
          Mandela wipes his mouth and waits. Linga and Hendrick appear
          in the doorway. They look even bigger indoors.

          ABOVE THE SPRINGBOK BENCH, near the field, we find Nerine,

          Jason stalks the runways between the seating sections, high

          Something catches his eye. Something in the air. Jason
          lifts his binoculars to his eyes.

          Jason lowers his binoculars. He frowns -- more puzzled than
          alarmed. (This is pre-9/11.)

          CLEATS.
                         
          Down the opposite stairway come THE ALL BLACKS. This is the
          first time we have seen them in the flesh.
                         
          Huge men, black on black uniforms, arrogant. Been here
          before, done this before. The best in the world, expecting
          nothing but the best from the day.

          The Springbok wing sneaks a peek at JONAH LOMU.
                         
          The biggest, fastest wing ever. Even bigger looking in this
          confined space. Bigger than the Springbok wing, bigger than
          any of the Springbok backs, bigger than most of the Springbok
          forwards.

                         CAPE TOWN
                         
          The crowd catches its breath. This is unprecedented,
          shocking ... and brilliant.
                         
          The Springboks digest this extraordinary display of support.

                          SPRINGBOK HOOKER
           (murmuring to Pienaar)
           The All Blacks won't like that.
                         
          Pienaar nods, eyes glinting. Mandela is giving them an edge.
                         
          As he walks towards the waiting teams, Mandela lifts the
          Springbok cap high, waves it, and fires his famous,
          beautiful, huge, African smile at the crowd --
                         
          -- who roar and stand, slowly, and start chanting, slowly ...
                         
                          CROWD

          Mandela shakes hands with the Springboks, who are brimming
          with pride. Mandela shakes Chester Williams' hand with
          special energy.
                         
                          MANDELA

          ON THE FIELD, Mandela shakes hands with the All Blacks, who,
          as predicted, don't like his partisan clothing. Mandela
          looks up at Jonah Lomu.
                         
                          MANDELA
           Hello, Jonah.
                         
          Lomu looks down at Mandela, eyes glowing with aggression --
                         
          -- and suddenly, he bares his tattooed Tongan tongue in a
          FIERCE WAR CRY.
                         
          As do the rest of the All Blacks.
                         
          WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that
          tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen,
          their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their
          skulls with a sharpened tea spoon.
                         
          It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told
          Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the
          whistle blows.
                         
          This is very intimidating.
                         
          Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka
          closer and closer to the Springboks --
                         
          -- who do not back down. In fact, they close ranks and
          advance.
                         
          Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The
          emotions, the aggression are real.
                         
          ON MANDELA, whose diplomatic mask slips a little showing a
          warrior's glitter in his eyes. He wants to respond,
          primally. His fists clench at his side.
                         
          The HAKA ENDS with a fearsome, guttural Maori yell.
                         
          ON THE SPRINGBOKS, massed together, faces red with emotion,
          pulses racing.
                         
          Mandela takes a deep breath in.
                         
          Then the boys answer.
                         
          With, of course, a terrorist anthem of their own: NKOSI
          SIKELEL' IAFRIKA.

          Pienaar starts it.
                         
                          PIENAAR
                          NKOSI --
                         
                          ALL SPRINGBOKS
           -- SIKELEL' IAFRIKA etc ...
                         
          With decent pronunciation, with full fervor and heart, THE
          BOYS ROAR THE ANTHEM back at the All Blacks.
                         
          The crowd joins them. "Nkosi" roars through the stadium,
          through the nation.
                         
          ON MANDELA: his heart swells, as he sings with his people.

          ON JASON, who stands surrounded by his former enemies singing
          the song that kept him -- kept all of them -- going through
          the apartheid years.
                         
          In this stadium, at this moment, all hostility, all fear, are
          a thing of the past.
                         
          The tension finally goes out of Jason's shoulders.
                         
          ON JASON'S FACE, close to tears, as NKOSI slowly fades.
                         
          As Mandela said -- a very inspirational song.

          As the fly half back-pedals slowly, and pauses in readiness,
          waiting for the whistle --
                         
                          CUT AWAY:

          A RADIO PLAYS NEARBY, tuned to the game. The radio is in a
          cop car, manned by TWO BEEFY WHITE COPS. As the crowd noise

          outwardly professional -- but bursting with excitement.

          The All Black fly half boots the ball towards the Springboks,
          charges after it, along with the rest of the All Blacks.
                         
          Game on.
                         
          We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
          a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
          coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
                         
          Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
          piece of mayhem up close and personal.
                         
          We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
          the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
          abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
          subcutaneous blood.
           136.
                         
                         
                         
          We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into
          flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist
          smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling
          maul.
                         
          For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as
          the Springbok coach wanted.
                         
          This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
          best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
                         
          This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
          pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
          making mistakes. Lots of them.
                         
          Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
          movement, no electric building of momentum.
                         
          Because of one thing: tackling.
                         
          Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
                         
          The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
          holds its breath --
                         
          -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
          wraps him up and brings him down.
                         
          The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
          behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
                         
          We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
          from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
          country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
                         
          ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
          example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
                         
          ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
          running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
                         
          ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
          their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for
          money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
                         
          Outdated notions. We miss them.
                         
          No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
          each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
                         
          With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
          penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
          make them or fail. That is pressure.

          The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok
          fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and
          with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal
          through the uprights.
                         
          The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
                         
          So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
          half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
          9.
                         
          Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks
          camp in the Springbok half.
                         
          The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
          who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
                         
          The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
                         
          43 million South Africans hold their breath.
                         
          All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs.
          This will be the decisive blow.
                         
          But the kick just goes wide.
          Relief.
                         
          The referee blows his whistle to signal the end of
          regulation. Both teams are spent.

          Two sets of bruised, bleeding, exhausted, cramping men face
          each other for the extra time kick off.
                         
          Pienaar turns to his men.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Who's the fittest team on this
           field?
                         
          The answer lies in their eyes: they are.
                         
          An All Black penalty goal makes it 12 - 9 almost immediately.
                         
          A Springbok penalty goal answers. 12 - 12.
                         
          Seven minutes from the end of extra time, the Springboks earn
          a scrum deep in All Blacks territory.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           Keep it here. Run it forward.
                         
          The scrum goes down, wheels a little.
                         
           SPRINGBOK FLY HALF
           Francois!
          Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest:
          give me the ball.
                         
          Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the
          ball.
                         
          The ball goes into the scrum.
                         
          The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight
          Springbok forwards.
                         
          The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half --
                         
          -- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high
          into the air.
                         
          Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the
          uprights ...
                         
          ... but through them nonetheless.
                         
          Springboks 15 - 12 All Blacks.

           Seven minutes.

          INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY

          ON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet
          for another tackle.
                         
          He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle --
                         
          -- looks over at the referee --

          Behind them, a WORK CREW ASSEMBLES A PORTABLE PODIUM.

          buffoon.
                         
                          BOLAND BOTHA
           ... great game, but I don't think
           you could've done it without the
           amazing support of these 63,000
           South Africans --
                         
          Francois grabs the mike from Boland.
                         
                          PIENAAR
           (into mike, words booming)
           We didn't have the support of
           63,000 South Africans today. We
           had the support of 42 million South
           Africans.
                         
          The crowd roars.
                         
          The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.

          Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy.
                         
          In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold
          confection.
                         
          Their eyes meet.

          one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a
          lifetime of bruises implied.

           Mr. President, I want to thank you

          Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes --
          African eyes, both.
                         
          And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional
          sports hero's moment, richly deserved.
                         
          Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
                         
          But that is not the real prize.

          INT. GREY BMW (LEAD) - END OF THE DAY
                         
          Jason nods, puts down his radio, settles back with a deep
          sigh. So do the rest of the boys in the car. This day is
          almost over.
                         
                         
          INT. GREY BMW (TRAILER) - END OF THE DAY
                         
          Etienne, Hendrick loosen their ties, bask in the feeling.
          Hendrick looks out at the rolling street party -- and shakes
          his head in amazement.
                         
                         
          INT. PRESIDENT'S MERCEDES - END OF THE DAY
                         
          President Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela undoes the top button of
          his rugby jersey, settles back with a deep sigh --
                         
          -- and drives home through a nation that has begun the
          process of forgiving itself. His nation.
                         
          GO IN ON MANDELA'S FACE as it settles into the now-familiar
          sphinx-like mask.
                         
          Except for his eyes.
                         
          Mandela's eyes glow with deep joy and satisfaction as he
          moves slowly through a moment in history that he has worked
          for, all his life.
                         
          ON MANDELA'S EYES ...
                         
           FADE EVER SO
           SLOWLY TO BLACK.
                         
                         
                         
                          THE END
