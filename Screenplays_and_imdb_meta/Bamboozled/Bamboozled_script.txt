BLACK SCREEN

We HEAR the voice of MALCOLM X.

                    MALCOLM X (V.O.)
               You've been hoodwinked.  You've
               been had.  You've been took.
               You've been led astray, run amok.
               You've been bamboozled.

His followers ROAR.

WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK

WE HEAR the VOICE of PIERRE DELACROIX.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Satire.  1a.  A literary work in
               which human vice or folly is
               ridiculed or attacked scornfully.
               B.  The branch of literature that
               composes such work.  2.  Irony,
               derision or caustic wit used to
               attack or expose folly, vice or
               stupidity.

INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

WE are in the living quarters of PIERRE DELACROIX.  The
windows overlook the Brooklyn Promenade and the majestic
lower Manhattan skyline.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Bonjour, my name is Pierre Delacroix.
               I'm a television writer, also a
               showrunner, a creative person.

We see a tall figure move in and around the space.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I'm one of those people responsible
               for what you view on your idiot box.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               The problem is not enough of you
               have been watching.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               With the onslaught of the internet,
               video and interactive games, nine
               hundred channels to choose from and
               whatnot, our valued audience has
               dramatically eroded.

               terms...

Delacroix YELLS.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Like rats fleeing a sinking ship.

CLOSE ON

The handsome face of Pierre Delacroix.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               People tuning out by the millions.

Delacroix turns to the CAMERA and addresses US.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Which is not good.

EXT. TENEMENT - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING

The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out,
but a home, a shelter nonetheless.

INT. TENEMENT - MORNING

People to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The
homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about,
written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society.

CHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a
slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers.

                                                  3.


                    CHEEBA
               Yo, let's get to it.  You don't
               dance, we don't eat.  Simple as that.

The mass begins to move.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               That's right.  We slow.  We blow.
               We snooze.  We lose.

INT. CNS TOWER - MORNING

MANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba
are getting set up in front of the entrance to the
CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the
fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC,
NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN.

ANGLE ON

Entrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the
sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off
and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles
of the shoes instead of real taps.

                    CHEEBA
               Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
               I know everybody is in a hurry to
               work, ready to begin another day in
               this rat race.  But don't sleep us.
               I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you
               the world renown MANRAY, the man
               with the educated feet.

Manray takes a small bow.  A few, not many, people have
stopped to look.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               As we continue our world wind tour,
               we would like to give you a little
               somethin', somethin' before you go
               off to make that money.  I give you
               Manray.

CLOSE ON

Manray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing
his thing attention must be paid.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, as Manray gets busy, people gather to watch.

ANGLE ON

                                                  4.


Delacroix, he is about to walk into the CNS building but
stops to check out Manray.

CLOSE ON

Manray, he pounds out some intricate steps and freezes at
the end of the move.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, who applaud as Cheeba unfolds a brown shopping bag
and holds it out in front of them.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               Thank you very much but please
               don't go without giving us some
               cheddar, cheese, money.  We prefer
               two's than fews.

People are digging into their pockets.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               I would like to add that both of us
               are homeless.  Not that it means
               anything.

A WOMAN is about to dump some change in the brown paper bag.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               I said homeless.  Ladies and
               gentlemen.  Senorita, do you know
               what that means?

Cheeba looks at her and she quickly pulls out a 5-spot from
her purse and drops it into the bag.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               Muchos gracias.

Cheeba works his way over to Delacroix.

                    DELACROIX
               Good morning, Cheeba.

                    CHEEBA
               Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.

                    DELACROIX
               De-la-croix.

                    CHEEBA
               Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet
               for Manray and I yet?

                                                  5.


                    DELACROIX
               Not yet.

Delacroix hands Cheeba a ten dollar bill.

                    CHEEBA
               Gracias.

Delacroix moves towards the revolving doors of CNS.

                    DELACROIX
               Manray, Sloan says you're too
               talented to be dancing on the street.

                    MANRAY
               Well do something about it.

INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

Delacroix is the lone person of color in the elevator.

INT. CNS - MORNING

Delacroix gets off the elevator, takes out his ID, slips it
through the scanner and enters the reception area of CNS.

                    DELACROIX
               Good morning, Marie.

                    MARIE
               It's not gonna be a good morning
               for you if you don't get into
               Dunwitty's staff meeting.

                    DELACROIX
               What staff meeting?

                    MARIE
               The staff meeting that started 30
               minutes ago.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff
meeting that is already in progress.  TWENTY WRITERS sit
around an oval table, all are Caucasian except Delacroix,
again he's the lone person of color, the "fly in the
buttermilk."

DUNWITTY, Senior V.P. of the Entertainment Division of CNS
looks at Delacroix and waits for him to sit down before he
continues.

                                                  6.


                    DUNWITTY
               Monsieur Delacroix, this very
               important meeting commenced...

Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               ...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm sorry I'm late.

                    DUNWITTY
               Do you know how much information
               can be dispensed in one minute alone?

                    DELACROIX
               I didn't find out about this very
               important staff meeting until...

Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Four minutes ago.

                    DUNWITTY
               So are you telling me everyone knew
               about this get-together except you?

                    DELACROIX
               I wasn't told about this until
               Marie informed me as soon as I got
               off the elevator.

All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.

                    DUNWITTY
               People, you can attempt to pull a
               Rodman like our friend Delacroix,
               but I guarantee you'll be sent
               packing just like him.

Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an
overhead projector.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               These are the standings.  Read 'em
               and weep.  As you can plainly see
               the Continental Network System is
               languishing.

               Look at 'em people.  We are BOOTY,
               CA CA.  We are DOO-DOO.  Doo-doo on
               a stick, if you will.

CLOSE ON

Dunwitty.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               I do not like to be the laughing
               stock of the broadcast industry.  I
               have pride and people, you better
               start getting some too.  These
               numbers have to go up.

Dunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers,
raises her hand.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               Question?

                    JOAN
               So what do you want us to do?

                    DUNWITTY
               What I want everyone to do is write
               some material that is FUNNY.  The
               junk you've been writing is about
               as funny as a dead baby.  It's not
               funny, it's not new.  It's not sexy.
               It, it, it...

                    DUNWITTY
               SUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This
               meeting is over but I want everyone
               to seriously think about what I
               said and how you can deliver.

People scurry out.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now.

                                                  8.


INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

The writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and
move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African-
American "sistuh."

Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He
talks under his breath.

                    SLOAN
               How was it?

                    DELACROIX
               Why didn't you tell me about this
               staff meeting?

                    SLOAN
               Nobody told me anything.

                    DELACROIX
               What good are you if you don't tell
               me stuff like this?

                    SLOAN
               It wasn't my fault.  If I would
               have known, I would have known.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action
photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on
his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.

ANGLE ON

Office.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows
overlooking mid-town Manhattan.

                    DUNWITTY
               Do you know what C.P. Time is?

                    DELACROIX
               C.P. Time is Colored People's Time.
               The stereotypical belief that
               Negroes are always late.  That
               Negroes have no sense of time -
               time except when it comes to music
               or dance.

They both laugh.

                    DUNWITTY
               Let's sit down over there.

                                                  9.


Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               I'm sorry about my blowup but I
               have to have a whipping boy every
               meeting.

                    DELACROIX
               I understand.  But again, in all
               honesty I was not informed.

                    DUNWITTY
               Forget it.  I believe you're my
               most creative person I've got on
               staff.  You're hip.  You know
               what's happening.  I got some corny
               white boys and girls writing for me.

Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he
doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is
headed with it.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               I understand Black culture.  I grew
               up around black people all my life.
               If the truth be told I probably
               know "niggers" better than you,
               Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't
               get offended by my use of the
               quote-unquote N word.  I got a
               black wife and three bi-racial
               children, so I feel I have a right
               to use that word.  I don't give a
               damn what Spike says, Tarantino is
               right.  Nigger is just a word.  If
               Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every
               other word so can I.

                    DELACROIX
               I would prefer you not use that
               word in my presence.

                    DUNWITTY
               NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.

Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse
and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.

                    DELACROIX
               Say it again.  C'mon, say it again.

CLOSE ON

Dunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp.

                                                    10.

Delacroix.

He straightens his tie.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Who's a nigger now?

POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO
REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.

                    DUNWITTY
               The material you've been creating
               is too white bread.  White people
               with black faces.  The Huxtable's,
               Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's
               dead.  We can't go down that road
               again.

                    DELACROIX
               I don't agree.  The Negro middle
               class does exist, and it's rich
               material for a dramatic series or
               sitcom.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm telling you it's not.

He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts
throwing them one by one against the window.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               The middle class black family moves
               into a white suburban enclave.  The
               middle class black family moves
               into a small Southern town that is
               run by the KKK.  The middle class
               single black father raises his
               teenage daughter.  The middle class
               single black father raises his
               teenage daughter.  The middle class
               single black mother raises her
               teenage son.  And so on and so
               forth.  It's too clean, too
               antiseptic...

                    DELACROIX
               ...to white?  I still feel all of
               my scripts would make good shows.

                                                    11.


                    DUNWITTY
               Delacroix, wake up, brother man.
               The reason why they didn't get
               picked up was because nobody - and
               I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers
               alike wants to see that junk.

                    DELACROIX
               I've never been given a fair shot.

                    DUNWITTY
               You got your head stuck up your ass
               with your Harvard education and
               your pretentious ways.  Brother
               man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm
               keepin' it real and you're frontin',
               trying to be white.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I
               don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM
               OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF
               DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as
               you might put it, some "nigger"
               show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than
               white and you're blacker than black?
               Is that what you think?

                    DUNWITTY
               That's exactly what I think.  I
               want you to create something that
               people want to see.  Let's be
               honest, the majority of the people
               in the country are deaf, dumb and
               blind and I'm including 35 million
               African-Americans.  You know and I
               know "niggers" set the trend, set
               the styles.  This is a golden
               opportunity now.  These idiots have
               to be led to the water.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm not sure if I can deliver what
               you want.

                    DUNWITTY
               You will or you'll be back at BET
               so quick you'll never know what hit
               you.  I need a mid-season
               replacement and pronto.  It will be
               on the fast track.

                                                    12.


                    DELACROIX
               What is it you want from me?  Some
               plantation follies?  Some sitcom
               that takes place on a watermelon
               patch?  Some show that follows four
               nigger generations of junkies and
               crackheads?  You want me to go back
               to the ante bellum days?

                    DUNWITTY
               Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show
               that will make headlines, that will
               have millions and millions of
               households tuned in, glued to their
               televisions every week.  I want
               advertisers dying to buy on this
               show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show
               out of you if it kills you.

EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT

WE SEE a street lamp, and coming out of it are some wires.
WE FOLLOW the wires into a tenement building.

The residents have tapped into a street light courtesy of
CON EDISON for power.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Cheeba stands in front of the makeshift kitchen, which
includes a hot plate, and prepares a gourmet meal of a tasty
Spanish dish.  The clean apartment is furnished with stuff
people have thrown out that they picked up on the street.

                    MANRAY
               I'm starvin' like Marvin.

                    CHEEBA
               My world famous, famous world Arroz
               con pollo will be ready very soon.

                    MANRAY
               Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.

                    CHEEBA
               Did we get our bill yet?

They both laugh.

                    MANRAY
               I guess that will come with the
               rent, gas, and Con Ed bills, too.

                                                    13.


                    CHEEBA
               Ahh, the luxuries of life.

                    MANRAY
               Yo, check it.  This is good and all
               that but one day soon I want to
               have much Benjamins so I can have a
               nice crib and pay all my bills.
               You hear me.

                    CHEEBA
               Chill, I'm the brains behind this
               outfit.

                    MANRAY
               And I'm the feet.

                    CHEEBA
               Yo, you gotta show some patience.
               You want me to snap my fingers and
               presto chango - you're an overnight
               sensation.  Son, there is no such
               thing.

                    MANRAY
               I'm tired of waiting.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He sits in front of a large flat-screen television, watching
the Yankee game and eating his takeout Chinese food.  On top
of the monitor, he has attached a sign that reads "FEED THE
IDIOT BOX."

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

She sits in front of her television, hand on remote, flipping
channels and eating takeout Chinese food.

INT. CHEEBA AND MANRAY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They both are devouring the chicken with rice, as they watch
bootleg HBO.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Delacroix sits at his desk, a ream of white bond paper in
front of him, a box of number-two pencils and an electric
pencil sharpener.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               I was never good at performing
               under the gun.

                                                    14.


CLOSE

Pencil after pencil gets inserted and sharpened to a knife
like point.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Well, this wasn't a gun, it was a
               bazooka and it was pressed dead
               blank right against my dome.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, staring at the blank ream of paper.  It is very
intimidating.

CLOSE ON

Monitor.  Bernie Williams is at the plate for the New York
Yankees.

CLOSE ON

Sign atop monitor.  Again, it reads "FEED THE IDIOT BOX."

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT

She too is blank.  A screen saver bobs and weaves on her
laptop.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT

Delacroix grabs a pencil and put it to paper.

CLOSE ON

Paper.  He doodles.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Manray screws out the bare light bulb which is the sole
source of illumination and lays down onto his mattress on
the floor.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT

Sloan closes her laptop and jumps into her bed.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT

Delacroix is already in the bed, the lights are out.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, who's wide awake.

                                                    15.


INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Manray and Cheeba are both sound asleep.

CLOSE ON

Cheeba, he has a sheet pulled over his head.

CLOSE ON

Manray, who's sawing logs, snoring loudly.

OFF-SCREEN, WE HEAR A RUCKUS, A BIG COMMOTION.  VOICES
yelling.  Police sirens, cars and trucks.

ANGLE ON

Apartment.  Cheeba and Manray run to the window and look out.

THEIR POV

The street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons.
Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the
building.

                    CHEEBA
               Oh snap!  It's a raid!

Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Cops in riot gear storm into the tenement.  A police chief
barks over a speaker system.

                    POLICE CHIEF
               Please evacuate this building.  All
               of you are illegal residents of
               this condemned building.  Please
               leave immediately, by order of the
               Mayor of New York City, Rudolph
               Giuliani.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Stairwell.  It's bedlam.  The hundreds of SQUATTERS who have
been living here all making a bad dash trying to flee the
NYPD as they "bumrush the show."

ANGLE ON

Floor.  Cheeba and Manray try to push against the crowd.

                                                    16.


                    CHEEBA
               Not this way.  Out through the fire
               escape.

The COPS are running up the staircase.  People try to escape
with as many of their belongings that they can hold.

                    MANRAY
               My tap shoes.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT

                    DELACROIX
               EUREKA!!

He jumps out of bed.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT

                    SLOAN
               Oh my God!!!

She too jumps out of bed.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING

It is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.  It's PANDEMONIUM.  The Squatters
are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement.
Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their
arrests and fill the "Paddy" wagons.

ANGLE ON

Street.  The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at
night, scrambling as the lights turn on.  Do you remember
those old "RAID" commercials.  "Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!"

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The phone rings.

CUT TO SPLIT SCREEN

CU OF DELACROIX AND SLOAN

Delacroix picks it up.  They yell in unison.

                    DELACROIX
               Manray!

                    SLOAN
               Manray!

                                                    17.


                    DELACROIX
               How did you know?

                    SLOAN
               It hit me like a ton of bricks.

                    DELACROIX
               How can this be?  You and me at the
               same time, the exact same thought.
               It's scary.

                    SLOAN
               The idea was out there in the
               universe.  Now what?

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Cheeba and Manray run down the fire escape and just elude a
group of cops.

ANGLE ON

Fence.  They lay still as the Fuzz run past them.

                    MANRAY
               We ran out without my shoes and the
               floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What
               about our savings?

                    CHEEBA
               Are you crazy?  The joint is
               crawling with cops now.  You wanna
               go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?

Manray looks at his friend, he knows he is right, at least
this time.

EXT. CNS BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

Delacroix and Sloan sip hot coffee as they stand in front of
their office building.

                    DELACROIX
               Manray was under our nose the whole
               time.

                    SLOAN
               Do you know how you will use him?

                    DELACROIX
               Not yet, but this thing will never
               get made.

                                                    18.


                    SLOAN
               You lost me.

                    DELACROIX
               Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And
               that's what I'm going to give him,
               it's going to be so racist, so
               negative, he won't have the balls
               to put it on the air.  Hence I'll
               prove my point.

                    SLOAN
               What point is that?

                    DELACROIX
               The point being that him, the
               networks don't want Black people on
               television unless they are buffoons.

                    SLOAN
               Sounds risky to me.

                    DELACROIX
               You getting cold feet?

                    SLOAN
               I'm in till the end.

                    DELACROIX
               Good.  I'm going to need your
               support.

                    SLOAN
               Can't you just quit?  Walk away?

                    DELACROIX
               And lose out on my money?  The only
               way I get paid is if I get fired.
               And that's what I intend to do.

EXT. CNS BUILDING - NEW DAY

It is pouring rain and Delacroix and Sloan huddle under an
umbrella.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Everything was going according to
               plan.  I was working on the outline.
               Dunwitty was off my back for now.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.

                                                    19.


                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               But there was a catch.  A big catch.

CLOSE ON

Sloan.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Manray and Cheeba were nowhere to
               be found.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

Manray and Cheeba are soaking wet.  They stand together in a
doorway, trying to stay out of the elements.

ANGLE ON

Street.  They run in the downpour.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               It was like they had disappeared
               off the face of the earth.

CLOSE ON

Cheeba.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I had no contact numbers, no
               address, no beeper.

CLOSE ON

Manray.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               No nuthin', no clues...

EXT. CNS BUILDING - NEXT MORNING

It is a sunny and pleasant morning.  Again, Sloan and
Delacroix hold vigil.

                    SLOAN
               Maybe something happened to them.
               Maybe they're lying in an alley
               bleed to death.

                    DELACROIX
               Manray better not be bleeding to
               death.  I need him.  After we're
               done he can do whatever he wants to
               do, until then, he's ours.

                                                    20.


                    SLOAN
               You're beginning to sound like
               Dunwitty.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Manray and Cheeba stand across the street from their former
residence.  All of the doors and windows have been boarded
up and two cops stand watch.  They both look defeated, dirty
and hungry.

INT. CNS LOBBY - NEXT DAY

Sloan gets off the elevator and sees a skirmish.  TWO
SECURITY GUARDS are trying to escort Manray and Cheeba out
of the building.

                    CHEEBA
               His name is Delapoint.

                    SECURITY GUARD #1
               WE have no one by that name.

                    CHEEBA
               Delapot.  Dela-something.

                    SECURITY GUARD #2
               De La Soul ain't here either.
               Let's go.  Out.  Off the premises.

Manray turns around and sees Sloan.

                    MANRAY
               Sloan!  She knows us.

The security guard stops.

                    SLOAN
               It's alright.  They are associates
               of Mr. Delacroix.

                    SECURITY GUARD #1
               Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.  They both
               walked in off the street without an
               appointment.

                    SECURITY GUARD #2
               Do you need an escort?

                    SLOAN
               That won't be needed.

                                                    21.


INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY

He sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old
"Amos 'n' Andy" show.  Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in.

                    DELACROIX
               Eureka!  Where've you been?

He hugs them both.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Sloan and I have been looking all
               over for you.

                    CHEEBA
               You'd take no offense if we called
               you DeLa for short?

                    DELACROIX
               No offense.

                    CHEEBA
               Manray needs a job.

Delacroix smiles at Sloan.

                    MANRAY
               We got evicted from our home.
               We've both been on the streets for
               the last week.

                    CHEEBA
               We was coming to see you.

                    MANRAY
               If it's not too much trouble could
               you order us some food?

                    CHEEBA
               We're starving.

                    DELACROIX
               I apologize.  What would you like
               to eat?  Anything you want.

TIME CUT

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY

A feast of McDonald's is taking place.  Cheeba and Manray
are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries
into their mouths.  They were famished.

                                                    22.


                    DELACROIX
               I have this concept for a TV pilot.
               There's no guarantee it will get
               made but regardless, you'll still
               make some money.

                    CHEEBA
               How much?

                    DELACROIX
               First things first.  I have to know
               if Manray is up for this.

                    MANRAY
               What do I have to do?

                    DELACROIX
               Some tap dancing, some singing.

                    MANRAY
               Where do I sign?

                    CHEEBA
               What kind of show is this gonna be?

                    DELACROIX
               Different.

                    MANRAY
               How different?

                    DELACROIX
               Trust me.  Of course I still have
               to pitch it to my boss, but we'll
               have an answer one way or the other.

                    MANRAY
               DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get
               to hoof and get paid too!!!

                    DELACROIX
               That's right.  Money turns the wheel.

                    CHEEBA
               What about in the mean time?  Not
               the in between time?

                    DELACROIX
               You'll both get an advance and you
               can stay with me.

                    MANRAY
               Bet.

                                                    23.


                    DELACROIX
               I would like to change your name.

                    MANRAY
               To what?

                    DELACROIX
               You're now Mantan.

                    MANRAY
               Mantan?  I don't even care as long
               as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me,
               I need some new kicks.

EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks
next to Sloan.

                    MANRAY
               I never had a really real pair
               before.

                    SLOAN
               You've never had any formal
               training, either?

                    MANRAY
               Not a class, not a thing, just
               picked stuff up by myself.

                    SLOAN
               I wish I had your natural talent.
               God only makes that visit once in a
               while.

                    MANRAY
               You sing and dance?

                    SLOAN
               A little.  I just graduated from
               NYU film school.  Cinema studies.

                    MANRAY
               So what's up with you and DeLa?

                    SLOAN
               What do you mean?

                    MANRAY
               Are you and him kicking it?
               Knocking boots.
               Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.

                                                    24.


                    SLOAN
               No, we're not knocking boots.  I
               got this internship while I still
               was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with
               my get up and go and hired me to be
               his assistant.

                    MANRAY
               I'm sure that was the only thing he
               was impressed with.  You look
               beautiful like that.

                    SLOAN
               If that was suppose to be a
               compliment, I thank you.

                    MANRAY
               You're welcome.  You shouldn't give
               up on performing.

                    SLOAN
               Why do you say that?  You've never
               seen me.

                    MANRAY
               I think that would probably make
               you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing,
               I mean really doing my thing,
               hitting it, nothing compares to
               that feeling in the world.

                    SLOAN
               I envy you.  That's the way I want
               to feel about my work.

EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

Sloan walks from the subway to her block.

ANGLE ON

Street.  A huge black Chevy Suburban follows her, all the
windows are tinted jet black, you cannot see it all into it.
She notices the vehicle and starts to walk faster.

ANGLE ON

Corner.  As Sloan tries to cross at the corner, the Suburban
pulls up in front of her, blocking her path.

ANGLE ON

Suburban.  A tall black man jumps out of the Chevy.  This is
BIG BLACK.

                                                    25.


                    BIG BLACK
               Li'l Sister.

ANGLE ON

Corner.

                    SLOAN
               You idiot.  You almost gave me a
               massive coronary.

                    BIG BLACK
               I didn't mean to scare you like that.

                    SLOAN
               Well you did.

                    BIG BLACK
               Give me some?

                    SLOAN
               I'm not huggin' you in the middle
               of the street.  You must be crazy,
               Julius.

                    BIG BLACK
               Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done
               told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't
               my name, you better recognize
               Hopkins was our slave name.  My
               true name is...

                    SLOAN
               I'm not callin you Big Black Africa.
               Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.

                    BIG BLACK
               BIG BLACK is the first name and
               AFRICA is the last.

He hugs her, she becomes lost in his huge arms and laughs.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Big Black is rummaging through his sister's refrigerator.

                    BIG BLACK
               Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food
               up in here in dis' piece.

                    SLOAN
               I order out mostly.  So what do I
               owe this visit to?

                                                    26.


                    BIG BLACK
               My group we need some exposure.
               Was wondering if you could hook a
               brother up?

                    SLOAN
               Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You
               must be smoking.  Why in the world
               would I want to hook up a bunch of
               red, black and green flag-waving
               pseudo revolutionairies?

                    BIG BLACK
               So now I see where you're coming
               from.  Just because we ain't
               rapping about Gucci, Timberland,
               Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and
               bitches, we're pseudo.

                    SLOAN
               Who are you revolting against?

                    BIG BLACK
               We're revolting against the powers
               that be, that been enslaving the
               minds and hearts of all people of
               color.  And we won't stop rapping
               till we bring about the overthrow
               of the government of the U.S. of A.

                    SLOAN
               Please.

                    BIG BLACK
               If you were really down you would
               get us together with that boss of
               yours.  What's his name again?

                    SLOAN
               Delacroix.

                    BIG BLACK
               Yeah, him.

                    SLOAN
               What makes you think he would write
               a show about the Mau-Mau's.

                    BIG BLACK
               C'mon, why not?  The Monkees had a
               show.  Look at all that other junk
               that's on TV.  We got underground
               cult following.

                                                    27.


                    SLOAN
               You don't have the demographics.

                    BIG BLACK
               So are you telling me that you
               wouldn't even introduce me to
               Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm
               talking 'bout me, your only brother,
               ya own flesh and blood, hook a
               brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.

                    SLOAN
               That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not
               blowin' my young career, brother or
               no brother, for you or anybody else.

                    BIG BLACK
               There is a name, a term for your
               kind, the likes of you.  Back in
               slavery days, you would be
               classified as a house nigga.

                    SLOAN
               If you think I'm a house nigga then
               that's your prerogative.  You got
               your ways to affect change, I have
               mine.  And I would appreciate it
               very much if you took ya field
               nigga ass out of my house.

                    BIG BLACK
               My own sister throwin' me out.  I
               hope to seeya later when you get ya
               mind right.  Don't bother letting
               me out.

                    SLOAN
               That's mighty black of you.

Big Black slams the door.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

One by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the
sofa.

                    DUNWITTY
               Delacroix, I'm glad you got your
               mind right.

                    DELACROIX
               It's right and tight.  Good morning,
               let me introduce you to everybody.
               You know my assistant, Sloan.

                                                    28.


                    SLOAN
               Hello.

                    DELACROIX
               This is Cheeba.

                    CHEEBA
               Nice to meet you.

                    DELACROIX
               And this is Manray.

                    MANRAY
               How do you do?

                    DUNWITTY
               Good.  I like the names.  Very
               theatrical.

                    DELACROIX
               We're all happy to be here and I'm
               going to paint a picture for you.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm wid it.

                    DELACROIX
               I've done a lot of soul searching
               and once again you are right.  In
               my previous work it's been all
               surface, superficial.  I have never
               really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As
               Mark Twain fully understood satire
               is the way.  Race has always been a
               hot button in this country's
               history and it needs to be pushed
               harder.  If we are ever to live
               side by side in peace and harmony.
               It's about promoting racial healing.

                    DUNWITTY
               Go on.  Good so far.

                    DELACROIX
               I know you're familiar with minstrel
               shows.  They came about at the turn
               of the 19th century.  It was a
               variety show in which the talent
               was in blackface - singing, dancing,
               telling jokes, doing skits.
               Dunwitty, I ask you when was the
               last time there was a good variety
               show on the air.  Carol Burnett?
               HeeHaw?

                                                    29.


                    DUNWITTY
               Word!!!

                    DELACROIX
               So let's take this great form, this
               very American tradition of
               entertainment into the 21st century,
               into the new millennium.

                    DUNWITTY
               The name of the show?

                    DELACROIX
               It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW
               MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know?
               Because I'm getting a boner, my
               Johnson is hard, no disrespect my
               sister.

Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               I'm feelin' dis'!

                    DELACROIX
               It will take a lot of courage and
               backbone on the part of the CNS to
               get this on the air.  In fact, I
               would understand fully if the
               subject matter is deemed too
               risque, too controversial.

                    DUNWITTY
               Don't worry about that, that's my
               department.  Now who do we cast?
               We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or
               dance?

                    DELACROIX
               I don't know if Whoopi is the way
               to go.

                    DUNWITTY
               Are these our two stars, sitting
               here in front of my nose?  Which
               one is Mantan again?

                    MANTAN
               That's me.

                                                    30.


                    DELACROIX
               And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat.

CLOSE ON

Cheeba.  A look of surprise is on his face.  Complete, utter
surprise.

                    DUNWITTY
               That's a great handle.

                    DELACROIX
               Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real
               coons.  I know we're way out there
               but it's satire.

                    DUNWITTY
               I want you take it there.  All the
               way to the edge and back.

Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern.

                    DELACROIX
               Every week we follow the trials and
               tribulations of two real coons -
               Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky
               Duo.

                    DUNWITTY
               What are there character traits?

                    DELACROIX
               Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and
               unlucky.

                    DUNWITTY
               Exactly!

                    DELACROIX
               Mantan is an uneducated Negro who
               always by some stroke of
               unbelievable stupidity makes his
               best laid plans go haywire.

                    DUNWITTY
               And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical
               sidekick?

                    DELACROIX
               Yep, you guessed it.

                    DUNWITTY
               This could be bigger than "Amos and
               Andy."

                                                    31.


                    DELACROIX
               Protest finally forced "Amos and
               Andy" off the air.  Could stop us
               from ever getting on.

                    DUNWITTY
               Let'em try.  I will kill to make
               this happen.

Delacroix looks at Sloan.

                    DELACROIX
               Negroes would be in an uproar.

                    DUNWITTY
               So what.  We would just give the
               NAACP a donation that would be the
               end of that.  No such thing as bad
               publicity.  So what.  Earlier you
               said singing and dancing.

                    DELACROIX
               Mantan right here is a gifted
               hoofer.  He has educated feet.

                    DUNWITTY
               Who are the other characters?

                    DELACROIX
               Do we have characters?  How about
               Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus,
               Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny,
               and how could we forget Aunt Jemima.

Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.

                    DUNWITTY
               We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY
               on dis' one.  What's the setting?

                    DELACROIX
               In the projects.  Like Eddie
               Murphy's "The PJ's."

                    DUNWITTY
               Ya first bad move.  Projects been
               done.  That's one of the problems
               now, everything, movies, TV, are
               set in the urban jungle, da hood.
               That's so tired.  Mantan's
               Millennium Minstrel Show should be
               set on a plantation.  In Alabama.
                    (MORE)

                                                    32.


                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               And every week these Alabama porch
               monkeys will make us cry, make us
               laugh, make us look at our own
               humanity.  Make us feel good to be
               alive.

                    DELACROIX
               I don't know about that plantation
               angle.

                    DUNWITTY
               What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's
               the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're
               movin' fast.  What does everybody
               else think about this?

                    SLOAN
               We'd get a lot of mail.

She laughs, it's a fake one at that.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Mr. Dunwitty, there wouldn't be
               another show like it.

                    CHEEBA
               I've always wanted to be on
               television.

                    DUNWITTY
               I like you.  Sleep 'n Eat.  That's
               funny.  Mantan, how do you feel
               about performing in black face?

                    MANTAN
               As long as the hoofing is real,
               that I can do my thing, I can
               blacken up.  Let me hit it, beats
               and rhythms, express myself.

                    DUNWITTY
               Show me a little somethin' somethin'.

Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               Delacroix, you dug deep, deeper
               than deep.

Mantan is ready.

                                                    33.


                    MANTAN
               I'm gonna give you just a taste.
               My tap shoes are brand new.  I
               haven't trained 'em yet.

He starts to work out.

                    MANTAN (CONT'D)
               Rhythms, rhythms, rhythms.  Beats,
               beats, beats.  No Fred Astaire
               here, baby.  Just rawness.

Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff
flying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up
on his desk and really starts hitting it.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.

CLOSE ON

Mantan, he's bringing it home.  With the final move, he
leaps off the desk into the middle of the office, and FREEZES.

ANGLE ON

The office.

                    DUNWITTY
               That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout.
               That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's
               off the hiz-hook!

                    DELACROIX
               We think so.

                    DUNWITTY
               Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do?

                    CHEEBA
               I play the straight man.  I do some
               singing and dancing also.  I also
               manage Mantan.

                    DUNWITTY
               Oh you do so?

                    CHEEBA
               I'm the man behind the man behind
               the man.

                    DUNWITTY
               You da man.

                                                    34.


                    CHEEBA
               No, you da man.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm gonna run upstairs with this.
               If CNS doesn't want to do this,
               somebody else will have da balls to
               pull the trigger.  I want to thank
               each and every one of you.  This is
               great, Delacroix.  I'll get back to
               you later today.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Cheeba and Mantan are walking in midtown Manhattan.  They
both have a pep in their step, money in their pockets, and a
roof over their heads.

                    CHEEBA
               Life is beginning to look up.  It's
               all good in da neighborhood.

                    MANTAN
               You might be right.

                    CHEEBA
               Why are you smiling so?

His smile is a mile wide.

                    MANTAN
               I'm not smiling.

                    CHEEBA
               Naw, not you.  It can't be.  That
               hottie Sloan Hopkins.

                    MANTAN
               It's that bad, huh?  It's all over
               my face.

                    CHEEBA
               No shame in ya game.  She got ya
               nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open.
               Sloan's what we certified ladies'
               men call low hanging fruit.

                    MANTAN
               Certified ladies' man, huh?

                    CHEEBA
               She's also moorish.

                                                    35.


                    MANTAN
               What's that?

                    CHEEBA
               Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of
               dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.

                    MANTAN
               Seconds and thirds, too.

                    CHEEBA
               Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm
               a tri-sexual.

                    MANTAN
               You'd try anything.  I got first
               dibs.  You get ya own stuff.

                    CHEEBA
               Naw, just jokin'.  That's you.
               That's you.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Delacroix sits with Manray and Cheeba in the living room.

                    DELACROIX
               I want you to start using the name
               Mantan and not Manray if you don't
               mind.

                    MANRAY
               Why?

                    DELACROIX
               You have to start getting into your
               character.

                    CHEEBA
               At the risk of sounding ignorant...

Cheeba turns quickly towards Manray.

                    CHEEBA (CONT'D)
               ...don't say a word but who is this
               cat Mantan you keep talkin' 'bout?

Delacroix hits the remote button.  The TV and VCR are powered.

CLOSE ON

Television.  We see MANTAN MORELAND in some obscure movie.

                                                    36.


                    DELACROIX (O.S.)
               This is Mantan Moreland.

CLOSER ON

Television.  Mantan reacts to seeing a ghost.

                    DELACROIX (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               He was a clown, a buffoon but he
               was funny.

ANGLE ON

Living room.

                    CHEEBA
               That ain't funny.

                    MANRAY
               DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.

                    DELACROIX
               Gentlemen, the show, our show will
               be satirical.  You know what that
               is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.

                    CHEEBA
               We might need some mo' money behind
               this.

                    DELACROIX
               That can be done.

                    MANRAY
               Mantan?

                    DELACROIX
               Mantan!!

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

THE MAU-MAU's in full effect, bob their heads to the funky
track that blasts from the studio monitors.

ANGLE ON

Studio.  They pass around joints that look like they've been
on steroids and 64 ounce JUGULARS of DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR -
liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of GHETTO
NEGROES.  All the members of the MAU-MAU's are AFRICAN
AMERICAN except one.  There is one Caucasian member.  He
goes by the name 1/16th BLACK, the engineer tech-whiz kid
computer geek.

                                                    37.


                    1/16TH BLACK
               Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for
               this joint.

                    BIG BLACK
               How 'bout...

Big Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he
quickly empties a 64 oz. in one swing without missing a
beat, without missing a head nod.

                    BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
               Black Iz Black?

The whole group goes crazy with the title of the song.

                    DOUBLE BLACK
               That's da bomb.

                    MO BLACK
               That's gonna give me some
               inspiration.

                    JO BLACK
               Gonna make me get my flow on.

                    BIG BLACK
               We should call dis da BLACK album.

Everyone starts high-fiving each other.

                    SMOOTH BLACK
               Yo, check it out.  We have never
               conformed to none of the white
               man's rules and regulations and
               later for that ole slave owner
               Webster.  Therefore I respectfully
               submit BIG BLACK that we from now
               on, hence forth and whatnot spell
               BLACK: B-L-A-K, not B-L-A-C-K.

                    HARD BLACK
               I feel dat.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               B-L-A-K.  BLAK.  The darkest of all
               colors, the opposite of white.  A
               member of an African people.  But
               check it out, here's where the grey
               people try to get slick with their
               trickery.  Listen to the full
               connotations.  GLOOMY.  DEPRESSING.
               EVIL.  WICKED.  ANGRY.  SULLEN.

                    1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)
               BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL.
               Need I say more.

                    BIG BLACK
               B-L-A-K it is.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

A middle-aged African-American woman is working in the
kitchen.  Delacroix sits at the kitchen table talking with
her.  This is his MOM, ORCHID DOTHAN.

Orchid puts a plate of food in front of her son.

                    ORCHID
               You must think I'm some kind of fool.

                    DELACROIX
               It looks delicious.

                    ORCHID
               You hear me talkin' to you.  The
               only time you come up here when
               something is wrong.

                    DELACROIX
               C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that
               I'm an ungrateful son stuff.

                    ORCHID
               I said no such thing.  All I said
               is that something must be wrong.

She sits down with him.

                    ORCHID (CONT'D)
               How's the food?

                    DELACROIX
               Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well,
               since you asked, it looks like I
               may have a new show, a pilot being
               shot.

                    ORCHID
               That's wonderful.  Isn't that what
               you always wanted, a show of your
               own?

He talks between mouthfuls.

                                                    39.


                    DELACROIX
               It was.  It is.  But this is a
               different kind of show.

                    ORCHID
               If at first it's not what you want,
               just work that much harder, Peerless.

                    DELACROIX
               Mommy, please don't call me that.

                    ORCHID
               Son, Peerless is your name.  Now
               you might be one of these Hollywood
               types, change your name and all
               that but Peerless Dothan is on your
               birth certificate.

                    DELACROIX
               I know what's on my birth
               certificate.  You heard from Daddy?

                    ORCHID
               I guess he's still on the road.
               What kind of show is this?  Are
               they some Negroes in it without
               being buffoons?

                    DELACROIX
               To answer your question, there are
               a lot of Negroes in it and what is
               your definition of buffoons?

                    ORCHID
               Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon.
               We have enough of those on
               television already.

                    DELACROIX
               Please let me know when you hear
               from Daddy, get a number or
               something.

                    ORCHID
               I will.  And good luck with your
               show.  I hope it's a huge success.
               You've worked very hard.  You
               deserve it.

Delacroix gets up from his seat and hugs his mother.

                                                    40.


INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A celebration is going on as Delacroix, Sloan, Cheeba and
Mantan sit at a table.

ANGLE ON

Table.  Cheeba and Mantan are giddy.  Sloan looks at
Delacroix who is visibly not happy.

                    SLOAN
               You okay?

                    DELACROIX
               I feel like somebody hit me upside
               da head with a sledgehammer.

                    CHEEBA
               DeLa - what's the matter with you.

                    MANTAN
               You ain't happy about the green
               light?

                    SLOAN
               People show their happiness in a
               lot of different ways.

                    MANTAN
               Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a
               funeral.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm happy for all of us.  It's just
               we have a great responsibility now.
               The pressure is on.

                    MANTAN
               Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know
               what the hell real pressure is.
               SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff.
               Now when you scramblin' out on the
               street in da January winter and the
               hawk is talkin' to you with NO
               money and NO prospects of money
               anytime soon, now that there is
               some pressure.

                    DELACROIX
               I didn't mean it to sound like that.

                                                    41.


                    MANTAN
               That's the way it came out.  Let me
               ask you one question.  Have you
               ever been in want, in need your
               entire privileged life?

                    DELACROIX
               Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because
               I didn't grow up on food stamps and
               welfare?  Because I didn't call
               home a cardboard box?  No, I never
               ever went to bed hungry and I'm
               proud of it, too.  Whoever told you
               that living in poverty earns you
               somekind of badge of honor flat out
               lied to you.

                    MANTAN
               The point I'm trying to make is
               that this is a blessing.  It's
               going to be fun doing this show and
               we should all look at it that way.

Delacroix gets up from the table and leaves.

                    CHEEBA
               What's wrong with him?

                    MANTAN
               Must be the pressure.

Cheeba and Mantan laugh, give each other some dap.  A highly
attractive PUERTO RICAN female walks over to their table.
This is JESSICA GRILLO.

                    JESSICA
               Sorry I'm late.

Cheeba and Mantan are in awe.

                    SLOAN
               Hey, girl.  This is my best friend,
               Jessica Grillo.  I invited her down
               to celebrate with us.

                    CHEEBA
               I'm Cheeba.

                    MANTAN
               I'm Mantan.

They both rise.

                                                    42.


                    CHEEBA
               Please, have a seat.

                    MANTAN
               Sloan never told us she had friends
               like you.

                    CHEEBA
               In fact, we never knew she had any
               friends period.

                    SLOAN
               Later for you.

                    JESSICA
               She has a lot of friends

                    CHEEBA
               Male?

                    JESSICA
               Yes.

                    MANTAN
               A lot?

                    SLOAN
               Enough.

Sloan and Jessica laugh at the expense of these guys.

                    JESSICA
               I propose a toast.

She grabs an empty glass and pours herself some champagne.

                    JESSICA (CONT'D)
               To the success of your show.  Good
               luck.

Everyone raises their glasses.  CLINK!

                    SLOAN
               Excuse me.

Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix.

ANGLE ON

Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Wait here.

                                                    43.


She goes to the ladies' cubicle.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.  He leans against the wall.

ANGLE ON

Bathroom door.  Sloan comes out, grabs him inside.

INT. LADIES' ROOM - NIGHT

Sloan locks the door.

                    SLOAN
               What is your problem?

                    DELACROIX
               My problem is MANTAN THE NEW
               MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

                    SLOAN
               Why did you even come up with that
               shit if you didn't want it made?

                    DELACROIX
               It was the principle.  Dunwitty had
               to be enlightened.  I was making a
               point.  I take pride in my work.
               Plus, I already told you I wasn't
               gonna walk away from my money.

                    SLOAN
               Fuck da money.  Why do through all
               this effort?  Why?  Are you looking
               for love from Dunwitty?  For
               respect?  Dunwitty and his likes
               don't give a goddamn about you.  So
               now what are you gonna do?

Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Will you please let me in?  I have
               to use the toilet.

                    SLOAN
               You're gonna have to hold it in
               because we're not finished yet...

She returns her attention to Delacroix.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               ...QUIT then.

                                                    44.


                    DELACROIX
               Even if money wasn't an issue,
               Dunwitty will still go ahead
               without me and that could be more
               dangerous.

                    SLOAN
               What's the chances of MANTAN being
               picked up?

                    DELACROIX
               I wouldn't bet against it.  My
               Negroidal ass is stuck between the
               proverbial rock and a hard place.

                    SLOAN
               Like I said, all this for some
               twisted, distorted sense of
               principal.  Dunwitty, he just
               tolerates your Negroidal ass, he
               doesn't respect it.

The banging starts again.

                    MANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Please open this bathroom door
               immediately.  You are being very
               inconsiderate.

Sloan unlocks the door and they exit.

ANGLE ON

Ladies' bathroom.  Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange
looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the
bathroom as they rush in.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

                    DELACROIX
               I strongly feel that a Negro should
               direct this.  This kind of satire
               is a high wire act in a gale storm.
               One misstep and we're doing "Amos
               and Andy."  Only a Negro will have
               the sensitivity and cultural
               awareness to navigate this dangerous
               terrain.

                    DUNWITTY
               To hire someone solely on their
               ethnicity, gender or religion is
               not right.  It's un-American.  I
               will hire someone who is most
               qualified for this particular job.

                                                    45.


                    DELACROIX
               I was hoping to perhaps direct some
               episodes myself, if not the pilot
               soon after.

                    DUNWITTY
               I want a hot, young white director.
               Maybe the kid, that pheenom who
               just did that hot new sexy Madonna
               video.

                    DELACROIX
               You're telling me some white boy is
               gonna direct this pilot?

                    DUNWITTY
               I just want you to meet him.  Keep
               an open mind.

                    DELACROIX
               Besides, what does he know about
               Negroes?

                    DUNWITTY
               Probably nuthin', but that's why
               it's such a sexy way to go.
               Sometimes an outsider has a fresh
               new outlook, a different unique
               perspective.  A black director,
               y'know what he's gonna do given the
               subject matter?  With this kid, the
               possibilities are endless.

                    DELACROIX
               What are his qualifications besides
               being a white male and directing a
               hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

                    DUNWITTY
               If Spielburg can direct "The Color
               Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid
               can direct the Mantan pilot.

                    DELACROIX
               That's exactly my point.  Has he
               even directed actors before in
               anything?

                    DUNWITTY
               No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's
               all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even
               let you choose your own musical
               director.  You can have that.

                                                    46.


                    DELACROIX
               In the immortal words of Derrick
               Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!!

                    DUNWITTY
               Derrick Coleman, he possessed all
               the talent in the world, coulda,
               shoulda, been a great ballplayer
               but alas D.C. didn't want it bad
               enough.  Delacroix, do you want it?
               Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you
               want it that much.

Delacroix stares at Dunwitty.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY

Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix

He surveys the room.

P.O.V. - DELACROIX

All of the writers are Caucasian - male and female.  Every
single last one.

ANGLE ON

Conference room.  Delacroix and Sloan sit down at the head
of the long oval table.

                    DELACROIX
               Good morning, for those of you who
               don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix.
               I'm running things and this here is
               my assistant Sloan Hopkins.

                    SLOAN
               Hello.

                    DELACROIX
               I've never worked with any of you
               and you've never worked with me so
               we'll be starting from scratch.
               I'm a fair person, a straight
               shooter and I don't hold my tongue.
               Everybody up in here should know I
               had nothing to do with you being
               hired.
                    (MORE)

                                                    47.


                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               I would have preferred at least one
               other Negro writer.  Any questions?
               Comments?

MONA raises her hand.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Yes, your name?

                    MONA
               He, I'm Mona.

                    DELACROIX
               Hi, Mona.

                    MONA
               I perfectly understand where you're
               coming from.  As a minority I can
               relate to your struggle also.  But
               I think you should give us all a
               chance.  We want this pilot to be
               successful just as much as you.
               Please don't be so quick to judge
               us based only on our whiteness.

                    DELACROIX
               Oh, is that what I'm doing?

BETH jumps in.

                    BETH
               I think because of our background
               we can bring a unique perspective
               to Mantan.

SETH pipes in also.

                    SETH
               A fresh pair of eyes.  A new look,
               insight, new angle that hasn't been
               seen before.

                    DELACROIX
               I've heard this somewhere before.

David raises his hand.

                                                    48.


                    DAVID
               My name is David.  I do think it
               would be better to have some
               African-American writers but for
               whatever reason they are not here.
               I don't know if they couldn't find
               any people with experience, they
               wouldn't work for the pay or
               refused to work for the show.  I
               don't know and nobody in this room
               probably knows either.  I'm looking
               at this as a unique opportunity.
               We all should.  I'm a damn good
               writer and I'm ready to go to work.

Everyone in the room applauds.  Sloan looks at Delacroix.

               This thing was rigged, the deck was
               stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don
               King be near?  Good thing Sloan had
               my back.  She's my rock.  This was
               going to be a whole lot of work.

UN-FREEZE FRAME

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               David, I appreciate your comments.
               Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody
               just talk out loud.

                    MONA
               I've always liked the format of
               Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."

                    ANNA
               That could be cool.

                    KIRK
               What about something like "The
               Jeffersons?"  I grew up in Idaho so
               that's how I got my understanding
               of black people.  Through Sherman
               Helmsley, LOUISSEE!!!.

                    DAVID
               "Good Times" was better.  Kid Dy-no
               mite!!!

                                                    49.


                    AARON
               You pole are going to far back for
               me.  I think we have to go after a
               hipper feel.  Like the stuff Eddie
               Murphy used to do on "Saturday
               Night Live."

                    PETER
               Or Martin.  You go girl.

                    JEFF
               What about the  black exploitation
               films?  No one has ever tried
               making that work on TV.

                    DAVID
               And for reason.  Have you ever seen
               "Scream Blacula, Scream?"

                    MONA
               I think, and Delacroix will agree
               with me, the politics of this show
               have to be right.  We should always
               be laughing with our characters,
               not at them.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets
them jerk off.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               The mission was accomplished.  All
               of these people left the room
               thinking they would have real input.
               I was writing this pilot alone,
               myself, me.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long line reaches down the block and around the corner.
It's a "cattle call," open auditions for "Mantan."

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Now came the fun part, finding the
               talented performers to cast in the
               show.

WE DOLLY past the hundreds and hundreds of unemployed
African American actors, many of them dressed in various
costumes.

                                                    50.


                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Everybody and their mother was
               trying to get in, trying to be seen.
               Trying to get their piece of the
               rock.

INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

Delacroix sits in the first row with Sloan, RUTH, an African
American casting director.  LEVI, the musical director, also
black, is on the stage at the piano.

AUDITION MONTAGE

WE SEE singers, magicians, dancers, acrobats, comedians,
rappers.  Some good, most are terrible.  Many come out on
stage dressed like mammies, Stepin' Fetchit, slaves, pimps,
ho's, hustlers, and basketball players.  It is a cavalcade
of all the stereotypical roles one has seen.

ANGLE ON

Space.  LULU, a spoken word artist, goes her rendition of
"WAY DOWN ON THE SWANEE RIVER."

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               This was amazing.  Who had told
               these Negroes that this was what we
               were looking for?  The same old
               image, it damn for sure wasn't me.

CLOSE ON

Lulu.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Were people this desperate to get
               work?

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.  He interrupts Lulu.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Thanks, Ms. Lulu.

                    LULU
               But I had several more poems.

                    DELACROIX
               That's good.  We've seen enough.
               We'll get back to you.

Lulu scurries off stage.

                                                    51.


                    RUTH (O.S.)
               Next.

The Mau-Mau's run onto the stage, yelling and screaming.

They are all fired up, in fact several fire their 9mm's into
the ceiling.

ANGLE - TWO SHOT

Delacroix and Sloan.

                    SLOAN
               This is the group I was telling you
               about.

                    DELACROIX
               Which one is your brother?

                    SLOAN
               The big one.

CLOSE ON

Ruth.

                    RUTH
               Let's get started here.

ANGLE ON

STAGE

Big Black preens around on the stage.

                    BIG BLACK
               The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place.
               That's right, the Mau-Mau's.

                    DELACROIX (O.S.)
               What's your name?

                    BIG BLACK
               My righteous name is BIG BLACK.

                    DELACROIX (O.S.)
               And what are the Mau-Mau's going to
               do for us today?

                    BIG BLACK
               We gonna drop some knowledge,
               wisdom and understanding.  The Mau-
               Mau's, we be scientists.  We drop
               science.

                                                    52.


CLOSE ON

Sloan, who's trying to disappear.  If she sits any lower
she'll be under her seat.

ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX
               We're ready when you are.

ON STAGE

                    BIG BLACK

               Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots

               Yo, I'm Double Black.

                    BLACK BLACK
               Check it, Black Black.

                    JO BLACK
               And he's Mo Black.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               I'm last but not least, you can
               call me 1/16th Black.

ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX
               Good.  We're really blacked-oops,
               backed up, so shall we begin?

ON STAGE

                    BIG BLACK
               Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One.
               Two.  Yo, the name of this joint is
               BLAK IZ BLAK.  Hit it.

                                                    53.


The booming track starts and the Mau-Mau's do their thing,
bouncing all over the stage.  The lyrics about everything
that is BLAK!!!

ON DELACROIX

A look of disbelief is on his face.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did
               not fit into our plans.

ON SLOAN

She's in shock, horrified.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               As I told Sloan, there's a black
               sheep in every family.

BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Delacroix is screaming at the top of his lungs.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Finland.  This is a travesty.  A
               debacle.  A mockery.

INT. LOBBY

Dunwitty approaches Delacroix in the lobby of the rehearsal
space.  He is with JUKKA, a young, very young blonde kid.

                    DUNWITTY
               Delacroix.  This is the director I
               was telling you about.  Jukka Laks.

                    JUKKA
               So nice to meet you.

                    DELACROIX
               Nice to meet you.  If you don't
               mind me asking you - how old are you?

                    JUKKA
               I just turned twenty.

                    DUNWITTY
               I'm gonna leave you two creative
               geniuses alone.

                    DELACROIX
               Dunwitty, don't leave.

                                                    54.


Dunwitty is out.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Where are you from?

                    JUKKA
               Helsinki, which is the capital of
               Finland.

                    DELACROIX
               Finland.

                    JUKKA
               You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?

                    DELACROIX
               Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever
               seen a Negro person before?  Even
               had a real conversation with a real
               Negro before?

                    JUKKA
               What's a Negro.

INT. BACKSTAGE

Delacroix continues to rant and rave.  Sloan is unsuccessful
in attempting to make him be quiet.

                    DELACROIX
               A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle.
               An abomination.

INT. LOBBY

                    DELACROIX
               Did you just ask me what's a Negro?
               I'M A NEGRO!!!

                    JUKKA
               Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term
               before.  I thought you were BLACK
               of African-American.  No?

                    DELACROIX
               Well before there was BLACK or
               AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were
               NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.

                    JUKKA
               Thank you for correcting my
               ignorance.  I'm looking forward to
               working side by side with you.  I
               feel we make a good team.

                                                    55.


                    DELACROIX
               How did you get this gig?

                    JUKKA
               My visual style is very erotic,
               sexy, how do you say - hot?

                    DELACROIX
               This is a TV show, not a music video.

                    JUKKA
               Then will you teach me what I need
               to know.  Maybe we learn from each
               other, if that's possible, no?

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

                    DELACROIX
               This is a travesty.  A debacle.

                    SLOAN
               You've said that already.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm gonna slit my wrists.  Cut my
               throat.  For the love of Joseph.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NEW DAY

He's sitting behind his desk, reading new "pink" revisions
of the "MANTAN" pilot.  He screams.

                    DELACROIX
               For the love of Joseph and Mary.

Delacroix bolts out from his office.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - DAY

Delacroix charges in as Dunwitty and Jukka go over the same
"pink" revisions.

                    DELACROIX
               I will not be held responsible for
               these revisions.  These changes are
               not the way I want to go.  This is
               an outrage.  This is a sham.  A
               violation!

                    DUNWITTY
               Calm down, please.

                    JUKKA
               In Finland, when we get upset...

                                                    56.


                    DELACROIX
               I don't give a good goddamn about
               Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever
               ya blond ass came from.

                    DUNWITTY
               We just punched it up a bit.  Made
               it funnier.

                    DELACROIX
               Funnier to who and at who's expense?
               Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run
               amok, the boycotts, when the
               demostrations commence, I'm giving
               them your home address.  Let's see
               how you like it when they picket
               your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.

                    DUNWITTY
               I seriously doubt that will ever
               happen.  Didn't I tell you I know
               your people better than you do.
               But if by some miracle you're
               correct, I'm gonna invite them
               inside my house and we'll have a
               sit down, discuss it like civil
               human beings.

INT. STUDIO - NIGHT

Much activity is going on.  People are moving to and fro.
WE FOLLOW Delacroix and Sloan.

EXT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Delacroix knocks and they enter.

INT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM

Mantan sits in front of his mirror.

                    DELACROIX
               Just want to say good luck.

                    SLOAN
               Break a leg.

She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek.

                    DELACROIX
               Wait a minute.  Hold up.

They all laugh.

                                                    57.


                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Can I kiss you too?

                    MANTAN
               Naw.  I'll take the zero.

                    DELACROIX
               You feel good, not nervous?

                    MANTAN
               I feel fine.

                    DELACROIX
               Not nervous?  Relaxed?

                    MANTAN
               Sloan, will you take your boss out
               of here so I can get ready.

               How's the audience?

                    DELACROIX
               Fired up.

                    SLOAN
               How you feelin'?

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Good.  I'm not sure about this
               material.

                    DELACROIX
               The material is fine.

Sloan cuts a look at this liar.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               You really think so?

                    DELACROIX
               We're trying to do something new
               here, some groundbreaking stuff.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               It's the bone breaking stuff I'm
               worried about.

                                                    58.


                    SLOAN

               and Mantan will be huge stars after
               tonight.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               You really think so?

                    DELACROIX
               Your life will never be the same.

                    SLOAN
               Let's leave the man in peace so he
               can get ready.

INT. BACKSTAGE

                    SLOAN

                    DELACROIX
               What do you want me to say?

                    SLOAN
               Just don't lie to me.

               Same here.

                    SLOAN
               The pleasure is mine.

                    VERNA
               My husband has been raving about
               the awesome work you've done.  How
               did you ever think of something
               like this?  It's absolutely
               brilliant.  Pure genius.

                    DELACROIX
               I guess it was divine inspiration.

                    VERNA
               Hope to see you both after the
               taping.  Congrats in advance.

               I was trying to be nice.

                                                    60.


                    SLOAN
               I want to apologize about my
               brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I
               should not have imposed them on you.

                    DELACROIX
               C'mon.  You were only doing what
               family is supposed to be doing for
               family.  You gave your brother a
               shot.  That's all anybody can ask
               for, an opportunity, a chance, a
               shot.  He got his.

               ritual the same.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

The audience is in an uproar when the lights go down.  They
applaud and they quiet as the CURTAIN GOES UP on a bucolic
setting.  It is a combination of WATERMELON PATCH and COTTON
FIELD.

                                                    63.


ON STAGE

First Sleep 'N Eat then Mantan shuffles onto the stage.

                    MANTAN
               This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               And this is my very best friend
               Mantan.

                    BOTH
               We're two real COONS!

The audience lets out nervous laughter.  They don't know
what to think.

                    MANTAN
               We both left the hustle and bustle
               of Uptown, Harlem...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...the big apple, New York, New York.

                    MANTAN
               To come back to our roots.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're
               getting countrified.  We is Bama's.

                    MANTAN
               No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't
               you smell the sweet aroma of the
               ripe watermelons and high cotton?

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.

                    MANTAN
               Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Give or cousins some of dem educated
               feets.

Mantan begins to do a slow, steady step.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)
               Cousins, first, second, third and
               distant, let's have Mantan take us
               all the way back to a much more
               simpler time.  A time wen men were
               men, women were women, and Neggras
               knew their place.

                                                    64.


The AUDIENCE is aghast.  Mantan has picked up the pace.
He's tapping fast and furious.

                    MANTAN
               Cousins, I want all of you to go to
               your windows.  Go to your windows
               and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the
               drugs, the crack babies born out of
               wedlock to crackhead aids infested
               parents.  I'm tired of the inflated
               welfare rolls while good wholesome
               Americans bring less and less of
               their paycheck home every two weeks.
               I'm tired, you're tired, we're all
               tired of these so-called bible-
               thumping God fearing, whore mongling
               Professional athletes.  Aren't you
               tired of these basketball-dunking,
               football-running, hop-hip rapping
               ebonic-speaking sex offenders who
               got ten kids from ten different
               Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep
               'N Eat.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               You tellin' the truth.

                    MANTAN
               Go to your windows and yell out,
               scream with all the life you can
               muster up inside your assaulted,
               bruised and battered bodies.  I'M
               SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M
               NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

Mantan stops dancing and collapses.

ON AUDIENCE

They're stunned.  They can't believe what they've heard,
what they've seen.  What they've been witness to.

ON YOUNG WHITE COUPLE

They look at the black people in the audience.

ON YOUNG HIP-HOP BLACK MALE

He starts to clap slowly.

ON AUDIENCE

Slowly more black people begin to applaud.  Slowly it sweeps
up into the black people.

                                                    65.


The WHITE AUDIENCE, of course, has been waiting to see how
their black brothers and sisters would react.  Now feeling
comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause.

ON AUDIENCE

The applause changes into laughter.  It is not nervous
laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER.

ON BLACK AND WHITE FACES

The laughter is contagious.

ON STAGE

Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead.  He
slowly gets up from his prostate position as he HEARS:

A WAYBACK ALABAMA JIG played by the house band, THE PORCH
MONKEYS, led by musical director Levi.  Mantan is joined on
stage by the other hoofers in the show: JUNGLE BUNNY,
SNOWFLAKE, SAMBO, AUNT JEMIMA, RASTUS, NIGGER JIM, plus
SLEEP 'N EAT.  Each take turn as it evolves into an elaborate
DANCE NUMBER.  The hoofers and the band are also in black
face.

ON AUDIENCE

They are rolling down the aisles.

               Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from
               the CNS brass.  They saw some clips
               from the pilot and they're rushing
               it onto the air.  Yo, we're a
               midseason replacement, ordered 12

               They didn't even view a rough cut,
               just some scenes we quickly cut
               together.

ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX
               This has to be a big mistake.

                    DUNWITTY (O.S.)
               The big mistake was my not believing
               in your genius earlier.  From the
               gitgo, from jump street.

                    DELACROIX
               Hold on a sec, I got a call.

HE CLICKS OVER.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)

               So what's up with you?

                    SLOAN
               What do you want to know?

                    MANTAN
               The good stuff.

                    SLOAN
               I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my
               life.  Can't go anywhere without an
               inhaler.

                    MANTAN
               What else?

                    SLOAN
               Are you trying to rap to me?

INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE

Delacroix sits at the kitchen table.

                    ORCHID
               He wants you to come and see him.

                    DELACROIX
               He said that?

                    ORCHID
               Yes he did.

                    DELACROIX
               Where is he?

                    ORCHID
               He's performing at some place
               outside of Richmond, Virginia.

                    DELACROIX
               I can't go all the way down south.

                                                    68.


                    ORCHID
               Richmond is not all the way down
               south.

                    DELACROIX
               I don't even know why you're still
               concerned over him.  Daddy's not
               with you.

                    ORCHID
               Regardless, he still is your father.

                    DELACROIX
               It's gonna be hard for me to get
               away with the show taking off.

                    ORCHID
               Even more reason to see him.  He'll
               be overjoyed with your success.

                    DELACROIX
               C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been
               impressed with anything I've ever
               done.  From winning my fifth grade
               Spelling Bee to the present.

                    ORCHID
               Peerless, last time, go see your
               father.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is
being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her.
To her.

ON BENCH

Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance.

                    SLOAN
               Are you trying to seduce me?

He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet."

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               You think that's gonna work, huh?

He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps
then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position.

ON MANTAN AND SLOAN

They kiss.

                                                    69.


EXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING

Delacroix is driving "down south."

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE
SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR

                    DELACROIX
               I figured this was a good time to
               get away.  Just jump in my ride and
               go.  I always did my best thinking
               when I was driving alone.  I needed
               to think out clearly what I was
               going to do with this MANTAN - THE
               NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.

EXT. I-95 SOUTH

Delacroix is driving on his way to "Ole Virginny."

EXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT

Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink,
funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint.

CLOSE ON NEON SIGN

"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK" - most the letters do not light up,
underneath it, "2-NITE - JUNEBUG."

INT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK

It's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark
establishment.

P.O.V. DELACROIX

This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are
dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot
different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the
men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM,
the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video.

ON SUGAR SHAK

Delacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into
another small room.

ON COMEDY ROOM

He walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on
the stage.

                                                    70.


ON JUNEBUG

He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his
hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage
doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and
sips it often.

ON COMEDY ROOM

Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him.

ON DELACROIX

He looks around.

P.O.V. DELACROIX

It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty.

ON TABLE

A couple gets loud, arguing over something.

ON JUNEBUG

                    JUNEBUG
               'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please
               show me some respect.  I'm up here
               trying to make a living.

                    MAN
               Mind yo' business.

                    JUNEBUG
               Don't make me have to come over
               there and whoop you upside ya head.

The sparse AUDIENCE laughs.

                    JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
               Just messin' with ya.  But please
               if you and your lady need to
               discuss something, take it outside.
               Thank you.

He continues on with his show.

ON TABLE

Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple.

                                                    71.


                    DELACROIX
               Brother man, that's my father up
               there and I drove a long way to see
               him perform.  Please take this
               fifty, go buy you and the young
               lady some drinks in the club.

The guy looks him up and down.

                    MAN
               That's yo' Daddy?

Delacroix nods.

                    MAN (CONT'D)
               Don't need yo money for drinks.
               Besides, she's drunk already.
               C'mon, let's go.

The guy grabs his friend by the wrist and drags her kicking
and screaming out the room.

CLOSE ON JUNEBUG

                    JUNEBUG
               Don't bring your woman out if you
               can't keep her in deep check.  If
               my woman ever did something crazy
               like that I'd put my size 12 dead
               up in her ass.

This gets the biggest laugh of the night.

EXT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Delacroix knocks.

                    JUNEBUG (O.S.)
               What do you want?

                    DELACROIX
               I want to speak with you.

                    JUNEBUG (O.S.)
               Go away, unless you got my money.

                    DELACROIX
               It's me, Peerless.

INT. DRESSING ROOM

He enters into a closet, it's a makeshift dressing room.  A
younger lady, much younger than Junebug - DOT - stands
behind him as she massages his neck.

                                                    72.


Junebug gets up from his chair, rushes to his son and they
embrace.

                    JUNEBUG
               Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.

                    DELACROIX
               It's been a long time.

                    JUNEBUG
               Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me,
               this is my lady DOT.

                    DELACROIX
               Pleased to meet you.

                    DOT
               Glad to meet you, too.  You are all
               your father talks about.

                    DELACROIX
               Is that so?

                    JUNEBUG
               Honey, pour me and my son a drink.

They both sit down as drinks are poured.

                    DOT
               I'll leave you two alone.

She kisses Junebug on the forehead before leaving.

                    JUNEBUG
               Good woman.  I trained her right.

                    DELACROIX
               Daddy, she's younger than me.

                    JUNEBUG
               My game is still strong.  No Viagra
               for me, don't need no chemicals.
               Just my tonic.

He holds up his drink and kills it in one gulp.

                    JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
               Purely for medicinal purposes.

                    DELACROIX
               I thought you had promised Mommy
               you stopped.

                                                    73.


                    JUNEBUG
               I did.  I'm not an alcoholic.  I
               just like to drink.

                    DELACROIX
               How did you end up here?

                    JUNEBUG
               How did I end up at the third rate
               chittlin' circuit greasy hole in
               the wall in West Hell, Virginny?
               Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?

Delacroix takes a sip of his drink.

                    DELACROIX
               That's what I'm askin'.

                    JUNEBUG
               Because I had too much pride.  Too
               much integrity.  I wouldn't lick
               nobody's butt.  Some material I
               refused to do.

                    DELACROIX
               Daddy, it can't be just because of
               that.  There had to be other factors.

Junebug pours himself another stiff one.

                    JUNEBUG
               That's the only reason, period.
               They only want one certain kind of
               black comic.

                    DELACROIX
               Another one of your conspiracies to
               hold ya career back?

                    JUNEBUG
               All I know is what happened to me.
               All that other mess I just file
               into the "life's too short" category.

He downs another one.  Junebug drinks like a fish.

                    JUNEBUG (CONT'D)
               Enough about me, what's happening
               with you?

                    DELACROIX
               The same old, same old.  Trying to
               get my stuff through.

                                                    74.


                    JUNEBUG
               Dem white boys giving you a hard
               time?

                    DELACROIX
               Nuthin' I can't handle.

                    JUNEBUG
               The truth is never let them seeya
               sweat.  You do that, that's half
               the battle.

                    DELACROIX
               Where do you go from here?

                    JUNEBUG
               Three nights Charleston, South
               Carolina.

                    DELACROIX
               I didn't mean that, in life.

                    JUNEBUG
               In life?  I'ma keep on living,
               having a good drink, got me a good
               young woman, make a couple of
               dollars and make people laugh.
               Haven't I always tol' you all
               nigga's are entertainers?  The
               question is what are you gonna do,
               Peerless?

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Delacroix and Dot are on either side of Junebug as they hold
him up.

ON DOOR

Delacroix struggles to put the key in the door.

INT. HOTEL ROOM

The door is kicked open as the trio comes in.  Junebug is
drunk as a skunk.

                    JUNEBUG
               I'm not an alcoholic.  I just like
               to drink.

                    DOT
               We know that baby.

                                                    75.


                    DELACROIX
               Let's get him over to the bed.

                    JUNEBUG
               Baby, you treat me so good.
               Peerless, you're a good son, I love
               you.  You never gave me no trouble.

They lay him down on the bed.

                    DELACROIX
               I love you too, Daddy.

                    JUNEBUG
               Always keep 'em laughing.

Dot takes off his shoes.  He's out like a light.  Gone.

                    DELACROIX
               How long has my father been like
               this?

                    DOT
               Not that often.  He was excited to
               see you.

                    DELACROIX
               So he drank himself into a stuper?

                    DOT
               The drinking is for the pain.  It
               doesn't kill it, just dulls it.

                    DELACROIX
               So what's up with you?

                    DOT
               I was a hostess at this club, your
               Daddy was performing and I had
               never laughed so hard in my life.
               He asked me to come with him.  I
               quit my job and we've been together
               ever since.

Delacroix pulls out his billfold and gives Dot five crisp
new model hundred dollar bills.

                    DELACROIX
               Don't tell him it's from me or he
               won't take it.

                    DOT
               Your father is proud of you.

                                                    76.


                    DELACROIX
               He never showed it.

                    DOT
               He did the best way he knew how,
               Junebug is stubborn just like you.

Delacroix kisses his sleeping father of the forehead.

                    DOT (CONT'D)
               I'll take care of him.

EXT. I-95 NORTH - NIGHT

Delacroix is driving back home - up North.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               My Daddy.  I'm not mad at him.  Not
               at all.  Junebug was the reason I
               got into this business in the first
               place.

CLOSER

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               And I thank him for that.  However,
               it did me no good seeing him in
               that state.  Daddy was a broken man.
               He had been a strong man, with
               conviction, integrity, principles
               and look where it had gotten him.
               I had to ask myself did I want to
               end up where he was?

OVERHEAD REAR VIEW MIRROR

Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself, and
SPEAK TO US.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               That was the last time I ever saw
               my father.

Honeycutt claps the cadence.

                                                    78.

               Eat.

The audience goes crazy as the curtain goes up and the house
band kicks in with the Mantan theme.

ON STAGE

The setting is a chicken coop, live roosters and chickens
move freely about Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat.  They start right
into their routine at a furious pace.

                    MANTAN
               Y'know my lady Lucindy?

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               The one with da big...

                    MANTAN
               Not her, the one with the little...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Oh her.

                    MANTAN
               Tomorrow is her birthday and I want
               to get her something really nice,
               like a...

                                                    80.


                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               No, not that.  How 'bout...

                    MANTAN
               She hates dem.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?

                    MANTAN
               Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky,
               sexy, little foxy...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Mantan, way too short, too tight.
               Get her one of dose...

                    MANTAN
               ...to big.  The in-between one, not
               too tight, not too lose.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               That'll work.  I just bought one
               for myself.

Mantan cocks his limp wrist.  The audience ROARS.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D)
               Not for me, my woolly headed cotton
               pickin' friend for...

                    MANTAN
               ...dat's too much money.  I can't

               ...aconite get it dat cheap.

                    MANTAN
               I'll buy her a less expensive
               dress, so I can have some money
               left over to take her out to dinner.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               We should go out on a double date.

                                                    81.


                    MANTAN
               I heard ya lady is wild.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               No.  That's her second cousin.
               Who's married to Li'l Bit.

                    MANTAN
               Oh, because on our first date, she
               let me...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...no, she didn't...

                    MANTAN
               ...yes she did.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...I heard different, thought that
               was...

                    MANTAN
               ...not that time...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               So when are you comin' to pick us up?

                    MANTAN
               Around...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...too early...

                    MANTAN
               ...then what about...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...too late, maybe around...

                    MANTAN
               ...perfect...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               That's what I like about you and me.
               We git along...

                    MANTAN
               ...like macaroni and cheese...

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...like grits and butter...

                    MANTAN
               ...like fried and chicken...

                                                    82.


                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               ...like sleep and eat.

OFF-SCREEN we HEAR the VOICE of MASSA CHARLIE, he's the
overseer of this plantation.

                    MASSA CHARLIE (O.S.)
               Who goes in there?

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               We'd better hide.

                    MANTAN
               It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa
               Charlie.

They hide behind some boxes.

                    MASSA CHARLIE
               I say who goes in there?

                    BOTH
               There's nobody in here 'cept us
               chickens.

Massa Charlie enters the chicken coops with a SHOTGUN
blazing.  Sleep 'N Eat and Mantan do a jig as they try to
escape the buckshot.

ON AUDIENCE

They're rolling down the aisles in hysterics.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH

Everyone in the booth is laughing uncontrollably.  Except
Delacroix.  Even Sloan is dying.

                    DELACROIX
               Who's side are you on?

                    SLOAN
               I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's
               too funny.

Delacroix starts to crack a smile.  He is definitely trying
to hold it in.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He sits in front of the television, which is off.

                                                    83.


                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               It was the Day of Reckoning.  After
               a massive advertising and publicity
               campaign...

CLOSER

Delacroix stares at the blank screen.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...the public would finally get a
               chance to view Mantan.  I was
               feelin' a little bit like Dr.
               Frankenstein.

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sloan, Jessica, Mantan and Cheeba are gathered around the
television in the small studio apartment, jabbering away.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               What would their reaction be?  I
               hadn't the foggiest.

                    SLOAN
               Everybody shut up.

ON TV SCREEN

We see the OPENING of MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL
SHOW.  It is in CLAYMATION.  Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat are
doing a "jig."  Their noses and lips are done in a grotesque
characterization, BIG WIDE BEGROIDAL NOSES and JUICY RED
SAUCER SOUP COOLING LIPS.

                    HONEYCUTT (V.O.)
               Calling all my cousins, you're
               about to take a trip down to Hang
               'Em High Plantation, home of your
               two favorite coons, Mantan and
               Sleep 'N Eat.

ON SLOAN, JESSICA, MANTAN, AND CHEEBA

Mantan isn't happy.

                    MANTAN
               Why they gotta make my nose so big?

                    CHEEBA
               Look at my lips.

                    JESSICA
               I think it looks cute.

                                                    84.

He takes the jugular from his lips.  As he speaks, flames
come out of his mouth.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The lights are on in the White House.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               I was sunk, dead.  My goose was
               cooked.  The cat was in the bag and
               the bag was in the river.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE

President Clinton is seen behind a TV set laughing his head
off.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

The President of the U.S. stands behind a podium and takes

               Did you watch MANTAN - THE NEW
               MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW last night?

                    PRESIDENT CLINTON
               Yes I did and I can honestly say I
               feel it promotes racial healing.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Dunwitty, Delacroix and Sloan are joined by a young Caucasian
woman, MYRNA GOLDFARB.

                                                    87.


                    DUNWITTY
               I know all of you have seen the
               overnight ratings.  Through the
               roof.  But in this game you gotta
               be one, two, three steps ahead.  I
               introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb.
               She's the best media consultant in
               the biz.

                    MYRNA
               First, I would like to say I love
               the show.  It's very courageous.
               My parents marched in Selma,
               Alabama with Dr. King.

                    DELACROIX
               Why are you here?

                    MYRNA
               Good question, straight to the
               point.  I like your style.  Because
               of the content of the show we can
               expect some spirited reactions.

                    DUNWITTY
               Myrna is here to help us plan our
               strategy.

                    MYRNA
               The best defense is offense.

                    DELACROIX
               I thought it was the other way
               around.

                    MYRNA
               You get my point.  I've mapped out
               some strategies to help bolster our
               position.

                    SLOAN
               Which is?

                    MYRNA
               That this is fun.  Nice wholesome
               fun.

                    DUNWITTY
               Goldfarb, run it down for them.

                                                    88.


                    MYRNA
               The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't
               it?  Number One.  We gainfully
               employ African Americans, in front
               of and behind the cameras.  Two.
               Let the audience decide.  Three.
               Who put these critics in charge?
               These so-called cultural police?
               Four.  Who determines what is black?
               Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six.
               If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.

                    DUNWITTY
               We all stick to this, it's smooth
               sailing.

                    SLOAN
               It sounds kinda simplistic to me.

                    MYRNA
               I've done my research.

                    DELACROIX
               These are black folks we're talkin'
               about, not some lab mice in a cage.

                    MYRNA
               Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in
               African-American studies from Yale,
               so I do feel I'm qualified.

                    DUNWITTY
               Let Myrna finish.

                    MYRNA
               Thank you.  And always smile.

                    DELACROIX
               Yeah, show dem pearly whites.

She ignores him.

                    MYRNA
               Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name
               of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the
               word "community" often when talking
               about Mantan.  And finally our
               biggest plus is you, Pierre
               Delacroix.

                    DELACROIX
               Me?

                                                    89.


                    DUNWITTY
               Yes you!

                    MYRNA
               This show was created, conceived by
               you, a non-threatening African-
               American male.  Voila.  End of
               argument.  It can't be racist
               because you're black.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!!

INT. CNS HALLWAY - POST MEETING

Sloan and Delacroix are walking in the hallway.  They keep
getting interrupted by people who congratulate Delacroix on
the success of the show.

                    SLOAN
               So you have your small victory, now
               what?

                    DELACROIX
               A small victory isn't that small
               when you've been use to losing.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - MORNING

Sloan hands Delacroix a wrapped gift.

                    DELACROIX
               What is this?

                    SLOAN
               A gift.

                    DELACROIX
               For what?

                    SLOAN
               No matter what you think, you did
               come up with something unique.
               Open it.

Delacroix opens his gift.  It is one of those old cast iron
Black Collectibles.  This one is called "THE JOLLY NIGGER
BANK," a head of a Negro, big lips, big nose, wide eyes.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Put a coin in the hand.

He puts a quarter in the hand.

                                                    90.


                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Watch this.

She pushes the lever and the mouth opens, the quarter flies
in and his eyes go to the top of his head.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Read it on the back.

Delacroix reads.

                    DELACROIX
               The Jolly Nigger Bank.

                    SLOAN
               This is authentic, not a repro,
               circa turn of the century.

                    DELACROIX
               Thanks.

                    SLOAN
               I thought it was appropiate.

                    DELACROIX
               Is that good or bad?

                    SLOAN
               It's all good.  You got a hit show,
               you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I
               love these old black collectibles.

                    DELACROIX
               How so?

                    SLOAN
               To me, it shows part of our history
               in this country, a time when we
               were considered inferior, sub-human.

CLOSE ON JOLLY NIGGER BANK

Delacroix puts another quarter in the hand and flips the
lever.  The quarter flies into his mouth as his eyes roll to
the top of his head.

INT. WLIB - DAY

Delacroix is a guest on the GARY BYRD show.  WLIB is the
number one black talk radio station in the nation.

                                                    91.


                    GARY BYRD
               Our guest today is Pierre Delacroix.
               He is the creator of the highly
               controversial TV show MANTAN.
               Let's get right into it.  You have
               been called by some in the community
               a traitor, a sellout, an Uncle Tom.
               Why does your show generate such
               feelings?

                    DELACROIX
               Because race has always been a
               sensitive issue in this country.
               Gary, I have no problem with people
               disagreeing with the show, it's
               when folks start trying to mess
               with my inherent right as an
               artist, that's when I get mad.  No
               one, in any way, shape or form
               should be censored.

                    GARY BYRD
               No matter how sexist or racist the
               material may be?

                    DELACROIX
               Yes.  And I say yes because who is
               to judge?  Who is to stand before
               us and say this is righteous and
               this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?

                    GARY BYRD
               But the line has to be drawn.

                    DELACROIX
               Don't you people get it?  We're in
               the 21st Century.  Slavery was over
               four hundred years ago.  All that
               stuff people talked in the old
               days, it's over.  Folks always
               crying, white man this, white man
               that.  Let's all grow up.

                    GARY BYRD
               Are you trying to excuse our
               Holocaust?

                    DELACROIX
               Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a
               great Aunt, we called her Sister.
               She went to her grave not believing
               man had walked on the Moon.
                    (MORE)

                                                    92.


                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               When I was a little kid, I would
               argue with her, "it's on TV."  She
               would answer "I don't care what's
               on that idiot box.  No MAN is on
               the MOON."  Well, there are a lot
               of your Negroes just like my Aunt
               Sister.  Face up to it.  The world
               has changed and if you don't adapt,
               change with it, you will be left
               behind.  This show is a parody.
               Are you telling me that nobody can
               use some humor, have some laughs in
               their lives?  Is that what you're
               telling me?

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

                    MANTAN
               Why is Jess and Reverend Al down
               there?

                                                    95.


                    DELACROIX
               So they can be on TV.

                    MANTAN
               You sound like the media.

                    DELACROIX
               This is nothing.  It will blow over
               by tomorrow.

                    MANTAN
               Same thing Giuliani said.

                    DELACROIX
               Tomorrow it will be all about
               cruelty to animals or some sex
               scandal.  Besides, there is no such
               thing as bad publicity.

He hands Mantan a wrapped gift.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Rest your mind.  It's a little
               somethin' something.

Mantan opens it.  He pulls out an old pair of tap shoes.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Those were the last pair of tap
               shoes worn by Bill "Bojangles"
               Robinson.  In fact, he died with
               them on.

Mantan starts to laugh.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               No joke.  Serious.

                    MANTAN
               Hope the same thing doesn't happen
               to me.  That's some big shoes to
               fill.

INT. MANTAN'S APARTMENT - CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

                                                    97.


                    SLOAN
               This is a nice place.  It must have
               cost a pretty penny.

                    MANTAN
               Gots no intention of ending up broke.

                    SLOAN
               Y'know, at the beginnin' of the
               century, African-American had to
               perform in blackface.  You ever
               heard of Bert Williams?  He was a
               great artist.

               No, before my time.

                    SLOAN
               You don't read, do you?

                    MANTAN
               Never read a book in my whole life.

                    SLOAN
               Maybe you need to start.

                    MANTAN
               Maybe I need to do a lot of things.

                    SLOAN
               Bert Williams and the rest, they
               had to black up.  They had no
               choice.  They were considered
               3/5ths of a human being.  Did you
               know that's written in the
               Constitution of the United States?

                                                    98.


                    MANTAN
               Why all of a sudden are you flippin'
               on me?  This blackface thing was
               part of the deal from the git-go.
               Don't even try to play it like you
               ain't a part of all this.  You down
               with Delacroix.

                    SLOAN
               I just don't want you and Cheeba to
               get hurt.

                    MANTAN
               We can look out for ourselves.

               and Sleep 'N Eat.  TWO REAL COONS!

The entire audience is in BLACK FACE.  They applaud, yell,

The curtain rises on Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat.  They are in a
cotton field.

                    MANTAN
               I fell out of my bed last night.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               You slept too near where you got in?

                    MANTAN
               I slept too near where I fell out.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               You expect the unexpected in
               circumstances of that peculiarity.

                                                    99.


                    MANTAN
               Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter
               with you?  Using all dose ten
               dollar words?

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Mantan, it is possible that my
               hyphenated sentences are entirely
               too complex for all the intellect
               contained in that diminutive coconut?

                    MANTAN
               Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis.
               Don't cross words with me.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?

                    MANTAN
               Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds
               me, I've seen a lot of troubles
               lately.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               How be dat?

                    MANTAN
               I don't know who I am.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Well, I'll be an Alabama porch
               monkey's uncle.

                    MANTAN
               Years ago I married a widow who had
               a grown-up daughter.  My daddy
               visited us often, fell in love with
               my stepdaughter and married her.
               Thusly he became my son-in-law and
               my stepdaughter became my mother
               because she was my father's wife.
               Soon after dis my wife gave birth
               to a son, which of course was my
               father's brother in-law and my
               uncle, for he was the brother of my
               step-mother.  My father's wife also
               became the mother of a son.  He was
               of course my brother and also my
               grandchild for he was the son of my
               daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was
               my grandmother because she was my
               mother's mother.

                    MANTAN (CONT'D)
               Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's
               husband and grandchild at one and
               the same time.  And lo' and behold,
               as the husband of a person's
               grandmother is his grandfather, I
               Mantan, became my own grandfather.

                    SLEEP 'N EAT
               Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.

They both start to do the jig.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Delacroix is leading the meeting of the staff writers on
Mantan.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               To my astonishment, not only did
               the people in TV land love us, but
               also the critics.

CLOSE ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Mantan was being hailed as
               groundbreaking, barrier breaking,
               also earth shaking.  I looked
               forward to my awards.  Just
               vindication for all my hard work,
               all my talent that had been
               previously overlooked.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

Delacroix sits in tux amongst many stars.

                    ALEC BALDWIN
               The winner for Best New Sitcom is...
               The envelope please...

A starlet hands him the envelope.

                    ALEC BALDWIN (CONT'D)
               The winner is... Pierre Delacroix
               for Mantan - The New Millennium
               Minstrel Show!

Delacroix jumps out og his chair and starts sobbing.  Two
ushers have to help him to the stage.  He is overcome with
emotion.  The audience is on their feet with a standing
ovation.  He hugs Alec Baldwin.

                    DELACROIX
               Alec Baldwin, this is the very
               first time we've ever met, you
               don't know this, I'm your biggest
               fan and I want you to have my Emmy.
               It's for you, out of the deep
               bowels of my heart - I don't
               deserve this.  You take it.

Alec Baldwin is shocked.  He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug
and they both cry like babies.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               If I did that I'd be assured to
               work forever.  Delacroix the
               grateful Negro.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

Delacroix sits at a table in his lucky tux.

                    WOODY HARRELSON
               The winner for Best Sit-Com is...

                                                   103.


Woody opens the envelope.

                    WOODY HARRELSON (CONT'D)
               ...Pierre Delacroix for Mantan.
               Come on up and get your Golden Globe.

Delacroix jumps out of his seat and sprints.  He gets down
on the stage and starts to breakdance, even spinning on his
head.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               That routine would go over like
               gangbusters.  I would be a dancing
               fool, Hollywood's new favorite
               Negro, move over Danny, Morgan,
               Samuel L., move over Whoopi.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Delacroix is finishing up the meeting.

                    DELACROIX
               I had it all planned.  To the T.

INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY

Mantan is running rigorous rehearsal of The Pikaninnies.
Over and over, repetition after repetition, Snowflake,
Rastus, Sambo, Nigger Jim, Jungle Bunny and Aunt Jemima try
to do an intricate dance step.

                    MANTAN
               I'm tired of you pickaninnies
               messing up my choreography.  It
               goes like this.

Mantan does the step with ease.

                    MANTAN (CONT'D)
               Try it again.

The dancers do it once more.

                    MANTAN (CONT'D)
               Better.

Cheeba walks in.  Mantan checks him out.

                    MANTAN (CONT'D)
               Let's take a ten minute break.

They quickly file past Cheeba without saying a word.  The
rehearsal space is just the two.

                                                   104.


                    CHEEBA
               I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

                    MANTAN
               What are you talkin' about?

                    CHEEBA
               Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking
               the Kool-Aid.

                    MANTAN
               Meaning?

                    CHEEBA
               I'm out.

                    MANTAN
               Good.  I've got a broken back from
               carrying you all these years anyway.

                    CHEEBA
               So that's what you been doing?

                    MANTAN
               Damn skippy.

                    CHEEBA
               You're in this up till ya neck.

                    MANTAN
               Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano
               players.

                    CHEEBA
               You can walk away.  We both can.

                    MANTAN
               Yeah, that's easy for you to do.
               You never had any talent.

                    CHEEBA
               I'm so tired of you running that.
               I always worked hard for you.  You
               think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I
               quit.

Cheeba walks out.

                    MANTAN
               I'm the star of Mantan, so you do
               that.  Quit, walk away.  And don't
               come crawling back, either.

                                                   105.


INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Mantan and Sloan ride in back.  He's still thinking about
Cheeba.

                    SLOAN
               Why don't you call him?

                    MANTAN
               For what?  He left.  Not me.

                    MANTAN
               My people love me.

He kisses her, she doesn't resist.

                    SLOAN
               I love you.

After a long, deep kiss she gently pulls back.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               I'll be down front.  You better
               start putting your face on.

                    MANTAN
               Y'know what?

                    SLOAN
               What?

                    MANTAN
               You look beautiful like that.

Honeycutt walks out on stage.  The audience goes crazy.

                    HONEYCUTT
               Thank you so very much.  Show me
               some love.

He laughs.

                    HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
               Thank you.  My name is Honeycutt
               and I want to welcome you to a very
               special evening.  It's always great
               coming back to the World Famous
               Apollo Theatre.

The audience applauds.

                    HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
               As everybody knows if you can make
               it here on this stage in front of
               the most discriminating audience in
               the world you can make it anywhere.
               Ladies and gentlemen, let's show
               some real Uptown love for Mantan

arms raised.  He starts to do his thing.

Mantan is a pro, he doesn't stop.  In fact, this makes him
dance harder and harder.

ON SLOAN

She leaves her seat and goes to stop her brother.

ON STAGE

Mantan is moving and grooving.  The unrest in the audience
has picked up.

ON AUDIENCE

They start to "boo."  The tide has turned.  Encouraged, the
Mau-Mau's pick it up another notch.

ON MANTAN

He's human after all, and he does hear the boos.  Don't let
those athletes in the papers fool you.  You hear the boos
and nobody, nobody except Dennis Rodman likes to be booed.
Mantan is getting rattled.

ON MAU-MAU'S BOX

Sloan rushes into the box and they are quiet.  They don't
have to say or shout a thing.  The rough Apollo crowd is
doing it all themselves.

TWO SHOT ON SLOAN AND BIG BLACK

The sister and big brother look at each other.  There is no
love between them.

                    SLOAN
               This doesn't change a thing.  I
               will still love him.

Big Black can't believe what he has just heard.

ON STAGE

Now projectiles are raining down upon Mantan.  This has
turned into a RUCKUS, a BROUHAHA, a DONNYBROOK.  Honeycutt
races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing
Mantan as the Harlem natives BUMRUSH the stage.  THE WORM
HAS TURNED.

                                                   108.


ON MAU-MAU'S BOX

Mantan, led by Honeycutt, runs for his life.

ON MOB

They chase him.

ON BACKSTAGE DOOR

Mantan is hauling ass.

EXT. BACKSTAGE

The door crashes open, Mantan rockets out into an open car
door.

ON CAR DOOR

The door slams.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The car spins away.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Delacroix is behind the wheel.  This is the most shaken
we've seen Mantan to date.

                    DELACROIX
               Pull ya self together.

Mantan is distraught.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               What are you?  A man or a mouse?
               Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?

                    MANTAN
               No.

                    DELACROIX
               You getting scared because some
               people don't like what you are doing?

                    MANTAN
               Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my
               black ass up in dat piece.

                                                   109.


                    DELACROIX
               You've made it from the guttermost
               to the uppermost.  Don't you know
               you should never let them see you
               sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?

                    MANTAN
               Yeah.

                    DELACROIX
               And now is definitely not the time
               to bitch up.

EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

Delacroix speeds away.

INT. BET STUDIO - NIGHT

Mantan is on the BET show with host TAVIS SMILEY.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Our guest tonight is the
               extraordinary, talented performer,
               Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.

                    MANTAN
               Tavis, thank you for having me.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Before we begin, I want to thank
               you for coming on my show for your
               first television interview.  You
               could have chosen Mike Wallace,
               Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley,
               whatnot but you're here.

                    MANTAN
               I'm more comfortable around my
               people.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Let's jump right into it.  Your
               show has sparked a world of
               controversy, provoked a tone of
               dialogue.  How do you see all of
               this?

                    MANTAN
               Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is
               the two-one, the 21st century and
               it's all about the money.  Like my
               man Mase says, "it's all about the
               Benjamins."

                                                   110.


                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Money and nothing else?

                    MANTAN
               Money makes the world go round.  It
               ain't no joke being poor.  I know
               whatI'mtalkin''bout.
               Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on
               the street.  I've been homeless.
               I've learned how to play the game,
               work the game, be in the game.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Is it inevitable that the game
               plays you?

                    MANTAN
               No if you go with the flow, Tavis.
               That's what a lot of Negroes don't
               understand.  Protesting isn't gonna
               do a damn thing.  If people don't
               like our satire in our number one
               hit show then don't watch it.  Or
               better yet write your own show.  Do
               it better.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Don't you feel that is a simplistic
               retort?

                    MANTAN
               I don't know what a retort is, but
               it's simple.  Mantan - The New
               Millennium Minstrel Show is
               UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for
               Negroes in Compton or 125th in
               Harlem.  This is America.  Our
               ancestors helped build this country,
               we got a right, just like everybody
               else.  I'm not gonna box myself in.
               This show makes people think, and
               they're laughing at the same time.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               I admit, that's a very hard thing
               to do.  Quickly let's go to the
               phones before we pay the bills and
               hear from our proud sponsors, DA

                    TAVIS SMILEY (CONT'D)
               Our first caller is Big Black from
               Brooklyn.  Go 'head.

ON MANTAN

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               Microphone check, one, two.  One,
               two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show
               but Mantan you is foul.  Why you
               perpetrating?  You a sellout.

                    MANTAN
               That's our opinion.

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               You're a traitor to the race.  A
               tool for the Caucasoids.

                    MANTAN
               Why?  Because I'm successful?
               Because I don't use "Causcasoids"
               as an excuse for not fulfilling my
               dreams?

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               I ain't hearing all dat noise.  You
               getting played and you don't even
               know it.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               And Big Black from Brooklyn, what
               do you do?

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               What do I do?

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               What do you do?

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               I'm a revolutionary.

                    MANTAN
               That's a job?

                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               That's a full time job, especially
               when sellouts like you are running
               around, acting insane.

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               That's enough.

                                                   112.


                    BIG BLACK (O.S.)
               And another thing, you better stay
               away from my sister or you better...

CLICK!!!

                    TAVIS SMILEY
               Ladies and gentlemen, there is no
               need to go there.  We can all agree
               to disagree without making threats.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Sloan turns off the TV.

                    DELACROIX
               Why'd you do that?

                    SLOAN
               I don't want to hear it.

                    DELACROIX
               How long have you and Hambone been
               hangin' out?

                    SLOAN
               You're the one that put us together.
               We're friends.

                    DELACROIX
               That crazy brother of yours doesn't
               think so.

                    SLOAN
               He's just playing big brother.

                    DELACROIX
               Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with
               Mantan?

                    SLOAN
               Please don't go there.

                    DELACROIX
               Dunwitty and I feel you've been
               getting too close to him, getting
               his mind all messed up.

                    SLOAN
               I can't lie to him.  If he asks me
               something, I tell him what I think.

                    DELACROIX
               Do you have to be so damn forthright?

                                                   113.


                    SLOAN
               DeLa, you should try it sometime.
               Come into the light.

                    DELACROIX
               Light?

                    SLOAN
               That which has been hidden in
               darkness is now in the light.  This
               bucket of blood.

                    DELACROIX
               You can talk all that mumbo jumbo
               if you want to but your hands are
               much bloody.  I know where I made
               my big mistake.  I have a general
               rule, never get involved
               romantically with somebody crazier
               than you.

CUT TO FLASHBACK

INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Delacroix and Sloan are taking off their clothes.

                    DELACROIX
               This is crazy.

                    SLOAN
               That's why it will be so much fun.

They kiss, fall half undressed upon the motel bed.

                                          CUT BACK TO:

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

                    SLOAN
               That was a mistake, but I don't
               regret it.

                    DELACROIX
               The first and only time.  A big
               mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you
               not to see Mantan anymore.

                    SLOAN
               Work related or otherwise?

                                                   114.


                    DELACROIX
               Otherwise.  I trust you know the
               difference.  You're an intelligent
               woman, finished at NYU.

                    SLOAN
               DeLa, kiss my big black ass.

                    DELACROIX
               And that's how you got me in the
               first place.

Sloan pulls a 3/4 inch cassette out of her bag and hands it
to him.

                    SLOAN
               I want you to please view this.  It
               may save your Life.

INT. MANTAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Mantan and Delacroix are in the middle of a heated discussion.

                    DELACROIX
               You shouldn't even be mad at me
               over Sloan.

                    MANTAN
               What you did is dead wrong.

                    DELACROIX
               Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this
               business if people don't produce,
               they get fired.

                    MANTAN
               Sloan is the hardest working person
               I've ever met.

                    DELACROIX
               Let me ask you a question, if I may.
               How do you think she got the job in
               the first place?  I don't mean to
               burst your bubble, Mantan the
               Marvelous, but Sloan is an
               opportunity.

                    MANTAN
               I don't believe it.

                    DELACROIX
               Do I have to spell it out for you?
               In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.

                                                   115.


INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

Mantan is grilling Sloan.

                    MANTAN
               How did you get this gig?

                    SLOAN
               Worked my black ass off, first as
               an intern, then worked my way up to
               this position.

                    MANTAN
               You leave something out?

                    SLOAN
               After my internship expired, Dela
               was impressed and offered me a
               position as his assistant.

                    MANTAN
               And?

                    SLOAN
               And what?

                    MANTAN
               Stop playing me Sloan.

                    SLOAN
               Just ask me what you want to know.

                    MANTAN
               Oh, you gonna make me say it.

                    SLOAN
               Say what, Manray?

                    MANTAN
               Did you ever sleep with DeLa?

                    SLOAN
               We did it one time, only once.  It
               had nothing to do with the job, it
               was stupid.  Everything I've got
               I've earned.

                    MANTAN
               Aw, c'mon.

                    SLOAN
               That's ancient history.  That has
               nothing to do with you and I.

                                                   116.


                    MANTAN
               So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna
               use me up just like you used Dela?
               Work it to the top.  I never
               imagined people in this biz could
               flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn
               happy DeLa fired ya ass.

                    SLOAN
               Forget about me, are you a puppet
               for DeLa?

                    MANTAN
               Don't try to change to the subject.

                    SLOAN
               Why don't you answer?

                    MANTAN
               I know I won't be your puppet.

                    SLOAN
               You can go now.

                    MANTAN
               I wuz leaving anyway, for good.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT

As usual, the clan is smoking and drinking DA BOMB, a thick
marijuana haze hangs over the studio.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               Yo, I got da bomb plan.  We gonna
               hook homeslice Mantan up nicely.

He holds up a floppy disk.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Delacroix sits behind the desk.  He's bought even more Black
Collectibles, he's surrounded by them.

ON DELACROIX

He dials the phone.

                    DELACROIX
               Hello, Mommy, how are you?

                                                   117.


                    ORCHID (O.S.)
               I'm doing okay.  Been reading about
               your show, it's all over everywhere.
               I watched it's all over everywhere.
               I watched it once.  I thought you
               said there would be no buffoonery.

                    DELACROIX
               You going to attack me too.  The
               show is a hit.  Aren't you happy
               for me?

INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE

                    ORCHID
               Of course I'm happy for you.
               You've worked very hard for your
               success.

                    DELACROIX (O.S.)
               Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy
               called?

                    ORCHID
               No.

ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX
               Not at all?

                    ORCHID (O.S.)
               You know how your Daddy is.

                    DELACROIX
               If and when he calls, please don't
               forget to ask him if he's seen
               Mantan.

                    ORCHID (O.S.)
               I won't forget.  When are you
               coming up here to see your mother?

                    DELACROIX
               Soon.

Delacroix hangs up the phone.  He takes out some change from
his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly
Nigger Bank.

TIGHT ON JNB

Delacroix flips the lever and the quarter flies into the
MOUTH as the EYES roll to the top of its HEAD.

                                                   118.


Delacroix does this several times.  CLOSEUPS of the BLACK
COLLECTIBLES in the office.

CLOSER ON JNB

Delacroix is staring at the JNB when its MOUTH OPENS, a
quarter flies in and its EYES roll to the top of its HEAD.

ON DELACROIX

He is incredulous.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               When I thought or imagined that my
               favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an
               inanimate object, a piece of cold,
               cast iron, was moving by itself...

Delacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it
off the table.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               ...I knew I was getting paranoid.
               Did I really see what I saw or was
               I buggin'?

ON JNB

It's stopped moving.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Honeycutt is warming up the crazed "Black Face"-wearing
audience.  He points to a YOUNG WHITE MALE, BOBBY

                    HONEYCUTT
               Is you a nigga?

                    BOBBY
               Hell yeah, I'm a nigga.

The AUDIENCE CHEERS WILDLY.  Honeycutt points to an old
WHITE LADY, LOUISE, a senior citizen.

                    HONEYCUTT
               Ma'am, is you a nigga?

                    LOUISE
               Yesiree Bob, you darn tootin' I'm a
               nigger.

The AUDIENCE loses it as Honeycutt hugs Louise as if she's a
grandmother.

                                                   119.


INT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Mantan looks up at his makeup laid out before him on the
counter.

TIGHT ON MANTAN

He stares at himself in the dressing room mirror.  Mantan
can't stand to BLACK UP anymore.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Honeycutt stands next to a young black couple TRE and STACY.

                    HONEYCUTT
               Are you a nigger?

                    TRE
               Yo!

                    HONEYCUTT
               Are you a nigga?

                    STACY
               Honeycutt, I'm a really real
               niggress.

Stacy gets a standing ovation.

                    HONEYCUTT
               You.  You.  Him.  Her.  We're all
               God's niggas.  Even the lost souls
               who don't know it are niggas cuz
               niggas is a beautiful thing.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

As Mantan walks down the hallway WE NOTICE he is not dressed
in his costume and he has no BLACK FACE on.

EXT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

A Worker is painting over Sleep 'N Eat's name on the door
and replacing it with HONEYCUTT

                    MANTAN
               They don't waste any time, do they?

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

The phone rings next to Delacroix and he answers.

                                                   120.


                    DELACROIX
               Delacroix.  What?!  I'll be right
               down.

Dunwitty looks at him.

INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Delacroix is met by BUNNING, the STAGE MANAGER.

                    BUNNING
               You better talk to him.  He won't
               listen to me.

Delacroix walks over to Mantan who stands in a corner.

                    DELACROIX
               Mantan, we got a show to tape.

                    MANTAN
               My name is Manray, goddamnit.

                    DELACROIX
               Kook and the Gang, it's Manray.
               Let's do the taping.  You go back
               to your dressing room, get dressed
               and blacken up.

                    MANRAY
               I'm not playin' myself no mo'.

                    DELACROIX
               How you sound?

                    MANRAY
               I won't do it anymore.

                    DELACROIX
               Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy
               Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it
               gave me no joy pulling ya coattail
               about her, just lookin' out for a
               brother.  I feel you, all this
               stuff happenin' at once but you
               can't let if affect your work.  You
               gotta be professional.

                    MANRAY
               I'm always gonna be that.  But I
               ain't doing no more buck dancing.

                    DELACROIX
               No costume.  No blackface.

                                                   121.


                    MANRAY
               No.  No.

Manray leads the way to the stage.

                    BUNNING
               I should notify Dunwitty.

                    DELACROIX
               And I should put my foot dead up in
               yo' ass.

                    BUNNING
               I won't be held responsible.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Honeycutt stands in front of the drawn curtain.

                    HONEYCUTT
               We apologize for the holdup but
               without further delay, ladies and
               gentlemen, boys and girls, let's
               give it up for Mantan.

A THUNDEROUS ROAR FROM THE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

                    HONEYCUTT (CONT'D)
               C'mon, don't be niggardly, give it
               up.  Show Mantan some love.

The CURTAIN RISES and MANRAY stands before them in his
regular street clothes and NO BLACK FACE.

ON AUDIENCE

The THUNDEROUS ROAR is CUT OFF LIKE the LIGHTS, LIKE CON
EDISON PULLS THE PLUG WHEN YOU DON'T PAY THE BILL.

INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT

Dunwitty is HYSTERICAL.

                    DUNWITTY
               Stop the tape.  Stop the tape.
               Delacroix.  Get me Delacroix.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Manray speaks to the silence.
_
                                                   122.


                    MANRAY
               Cousins, I want all of you to go to
               your windows.  Go to your windows
               and yell, scream with all the life
               you can muster up inside your
               assaulted, bruised amd battered
               bodies.

ON MANRAY

                    MANRAY
               I'm sick and tired of being a
               nigger and I'm not gonna take it
               anymore.

ON VARIOUS AUDIENCE MEMBERS

Black and white.  Male and female.  Young and old.  All in
black face.

ON MANRAY

He collapses onto the stage and the AUDIENCE sits on their
hands.  Manray gets up and begins to dance.

ON STAGE

Dunwitty runs to Bunning.

                    DUNWITTY
               Drop the curtain.  Drop the curtain.

Bunning drops the curtain.  Security rushes onto the stage
and grabs Manray.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               Escort him out the building now!

                    MANRAY
               I wasn't finished doing my dance.

                    DUNWITTY
               But you are finished.  Done.
               Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen.
               I'm gonna slide Honeycutt right
               into ya spot.  We won't miss a step.
               Get him outta here.

The security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at
Delacroix.  Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to
the top.

                    DUNWITTY (CONT'D)
               DeLa, I'll deal with you next.

                                                   123.


EXT. BACKSTAGE

The security guards toss Manray out the stage door.  Manray
looks down the alley and it's empty except for a parked SUV.
He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.  This is
Manray's dance of Freedom.

ON STREET

The Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a
dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him.
Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights.

                    MANRAY
               Whaddup?

No one comes out.

                    MANRAY (CONT'D)
               Whaddup?

The doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out.

                    BIG BLACK
               You truly are a dancing fool.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               Yo Black, you looking for trouble.

                    MANRAY
               Don't start none, won't be none.

The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.  Manray tries to walk
through them.  They block him.  Manray attempts to climb
over the suburban.  He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole
Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle.

EXT. EMPTY BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

The Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory.

ON CHEVY SUBURBAN

The Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the
vehicle into the factory.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

Manray sits, feet and hands tied, in the middle of a
cavernous space.  A digital video camera stands on a tripod
in front of him.

                    BIG BLACK
               You is one dead nigger.

                                                   124.


                    MANRAY
               What did I do?

                    BIG BLACK
               What did you do?

The Mau-Mau's laugh.

                    BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
               Brothers, he asks what did he do?

                    DOUBLE BLACK
               If you don't know there is nuthin'
               we can do for you.

                    BIG BLACK
               Nigga, you will be executed.

ON MANRAY

His face says he can't believe this is happening.

                    MANRAY
               For singing and dancing?

                    1/16TH BLACK
               You will be done in front of the
               world.

                    MO BLACK
               The whole world will be watching.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               Via the internet.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               The Mau-Mau's had come up with a
               brilliant, sadistic plan to
               broadcast Mantan's execution LIVE
               over the internet.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               We have pirated broadcasting
               facilities.  No way we can be found
               out.  We're in cyberspace.

                    JO BLACK
               Nobody will find you till it's too
               late.

MONTAGE

Various newsrooms, computer screens, people running,
shouting, yelling over phones.

                                                   125.


                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               The Mau-Mau's sent anonymous e-mail
               proclamations to the websites of
               CNN, ABC, MSNBC and CBS.  It was an
               invite to witness the Dance of
               Death, 9 PM, prime time, tomorrow
               night on a site to be designated at
               a later date.

INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Delacroix and Cheeba are being interrogated in two adjoining
spaces.  WE ARE seeing them through the two-way mirrors.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               It's no joke getting grilled by the
               FBI for five houts.

Delacroix SCREAMS.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               I don't know anything.

                    FBI AGENT
               We know you're involved in this
               abduction.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

                    CHEEBA
               You know more than me.  Why would I
               do something like that to my best
               friend?  Why?

                    FBI AGENT #2
               You tell us.

EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

It's a mob scene as the media frenzy heightens.  Delacroix
and Cheeba try to fight their way through the print and
broadcast journalists trying to question them as they leave
FBI headquarters.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               Somehow, someway, somebody had
               tipped the sharks off.  It was a
               feeding frenzy.

Delacroix and Cheeba start pushing people out of the way as
they get in to their waiting car.

                                                   126.


INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

There is a flurry of activity - people man phones, computers
all HI-TECH.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               The X-Force was brought onto the
               case.  When something involves the
               internet, these are the people IBM,
               XEROX, the CIA, FBI, even the US
               Government go to.

ON CLOCK

It reads "T-minus 19 HOURS 22 MINUTES."

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               It was a race against time.  The
               Dance of Death.

INT. CNS STUDIO - NIGHT

Dunwitty is taping a spot.

                    DUNWITTY

               entertainment division here at CNS.
               I come to you with a heavy heart.

INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

She's watching Dunwitty on TV.

                    DUNWITTY
               This abduction is a cowardly, vile,
               sinful and dastardly act and I
               promise these creeps will be
               prosecuted to the fullest extent of
               the law.  This is an attack on your
               American way of life...

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT

He's watching the same.

                    DUNWITTY
               We here at CNS are offering a
               $100,000 cash award to any

INT. X-FORCE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Delacroix and Sloan hurry to stay with BARNETT, he's the
commander of the X-Force.

                    BARNETT
               Let's go, time's wasting.

INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM

They follow Barnett into the war room.

                    BARNETT
               They sent the notice out on an
               anonymous remailer.

                    SLOAN
               A what?

                    BARNETT
               It's used to mask the origin of an
               email, also the computer from which
               it's sent.

                    DELACROIX
               There oughta be a law...

                    BARNETT
               Not yet, anyway, it's legal.  We
               will find the source where it's
               being broadcasted and hosted.
               We'll get the people that
               bushwhacked Mantan.

                    SLOAN
               Before Manray is dead?

                                                   128.


                    BARNETT
               I can't answer that.

ON CLOCK

It reads "6 HOURS 16 MINUTES."

MONTAGE

Police squads, SWAT Teams are busting into the wrong homes,
apartments, projects, hi-tech computer labs looking for the
Mau-Mau's.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               SWAT teams all up and down the East
               Coast busted in on known dissidents
               looking for Manray.  All the tips
               called in, info gathered through
               surveillance proved for naught.

INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM

                    BARNETT
               The both of you should go home.  We
               will keep you abreast.

                    SLOAN
               This is looking like a needle in a
               haystack.  It's hopeless.

Delacroix holds Sloan as he leads her out.  She is having
difficulty breathing with her asthma.

                    DELACROIX
               Thank you for your help.

                    BARNETT
               The X-Force always gets their man.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He sits in front of his GIANT SCREEN, on the desk in front
of him is the 3/4 inch cassette Sloan gave him.  He picks it
up and turns it on.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.)
               It was ten o'clock and the Dance of
               Death was about to commence.

                                                   129.


ON MONITOR

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Since a lot of people still didn't
               have computers, the networks sought
               a court order to carry it live,
               taking the feed off the internet.
               It was granted.  A life snuff
               broadcast right into your living
               room.

ON DELACROIX

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I had to give it to the Mau-Mau',
               they definitely had a sense of
               irony.  They chose www.nigger.com
               as the website to pirate.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

The Mau-Mau's ironically wear WHITE MASKS, they stand behind
the tied-up Mantan.  A device alters their voices.

                    BIG BLACK
               We are LIVE on the cyberspace.
               Whereas Mantan is a TOM...

                    BLACK BLACK
               Whereas Mantan is a disgrace...

                    SMOOTH BLACK
               Whereas Mantan is a head-scratching,
               foot-shuffling Negro...

                    1/16TH BLACK
               Whereas, whereas, where's the ass?

The Mau-Mau's laugh.

                    BIG BLACK
               Whereas Mantan the dancing fool,
               you are condemned to death.

                    JO BLACK
               The Dance of Death.

1/16th Black unties Manray.

MONTAGE

WE SEE DELACROIX, SLOAN, CHEEBA WITH LOURDESE, DUNWITTY,
JUNEBUG AND DOT, ORCHID, THE X-FORCE WATCHING THIS SPECTACLE
ON COMPUTERS OR TV SCREENS.

                                                   130.


ON COMPUTER SCREEN

We see a CARTOON, Yosemite Sam is shooting at the feet of
Bugs Bunny with his six-shooter in each hand.  Bugs Bunny is
doing a fast dance, dodging bullets.

ON MONITOR

The Mau-Mau's shoot at the feet of Manray.

                    BIG BLACK
               Dance nigger.

Manray taps.

                    SMOOTH BLACK
               You got anything to say for yourself?

                    MANRAY
               If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

                    SMOOTH BLACK
               Don't worry.

INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

She is having an asthma attack, it was brought on by the
proceedings.  Sloan uses her inhaler.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

Each Mau-Mau has a 9mm and is firing it at the feet of
Manray.  They scream "Faster!" and "Dance!" Manray is
hoofing.  He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck
pace, ever.  But it's evident his dance is one of defiance.
He's not dancing to stay alive.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He screams at the monitor.

                    DELACROIX
               Don't dance.  Don't do it.

INT. FACTORY

The Mau-Mau's have noticed Manray's strong will, his pride
and they don't like it.  They shoot even more at his feet.

                    BIG BLACK
               You ain't Blak.

                    DOUBLE BLACK
               Blak you ain't.

                                                   131.


                    SMOOTH BLACK
               You a Oreo.  Not Blak.  Not BLAK.

The Mau-Mau's start to chant, "Blak, blak, blak."

INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT

She hears this and quickly picks up the phone to call the
authorities.

INT. FACTORY

                    MANRAY
               There is nothing you can do to me.
               I'm wearing the taps of Bill
               "Bojangles" Robinson.

Manray is shot in one foot.  Then the other.

                    BIG BLACK
               Let's seeya dance now, Mr. Bojangles.

Manray somehow manages to right himself and starts to dance
again.  The Mau-Mau's can't believe it.

ON MANRAY

He dances like his life depends on it.  Despite the fact his
feet are a bloody mess.

                    BIG BLACK (CONT'D)
               You ain' BLAK.

He shoots Manray in the chest, the Mau-Mau's follow him and
he does a spastic last jig as the 9mm bullets riddle his
twitching body.

ON TV SCREEN

It goes black.

MONTAGE

Helicopters fly through the night sky.  Cop cars and trucks,
SWAT team vehicles are on the move.  SIRENS BLARE.

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE

Delacroix's head is on his desk.  He has been crying.  On
cue the Black Collectibles start to move.  The Jolly Nigger
Bank, Aunt Jemima's, Mammies, etc., they are animated for
REAL.

                                                   132.


ON DELACROIX

His head pops up as he sees the objects.  He too is in
BLACKFACE.  In a rage, he starts to throw them against the
wall.

                    DELACROIX
               Leave me alone.  Get away from me.
               You spearchucker.  You black sambo.
               You nigger pickaninny.  Fat Mammie.

Delacroix has finally lost it.  He looks at the shambles
he's made of his office.

EXT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

The Mau-Mau's come out of the factory high as a kite.  Each
has a big fat joint or a 64 oz. of DA BOMB.  They're also
doing a free-style rap about their execution.

ON CHEVY SUBURBAN

They get in when the squak of police walkie-talkie's clicks.

                    BIG BLACK
               It's the man!

What follows is a horrifying display of firepower.  All the
Mau-Mau's bodies are doing the Bonnie and Clyde Sonny
Corleone Dance of Death as bullets tear into them and the
Suburban.  Not one of them is able to get a shot off.  The
shooting stops.  The twitching stops.  All's quiet.  1/16th
Black comes out with his hands up.

                    1/16TH BLACK
               Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!  I've
               been held hostage.  They made me
               part of them against my own free
               will.  Don't shoot!

The cops quickly pounce on 1/16th Black.

                    1/16TH BLACK (CONT'D)
               I'm WHITE.  I'm WHITE!  Look at me,
               I'm white!

INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE

Delacroix is on the floor when the doorknob turns.  It's
Sloan and she has a gun in one hand and her inhaler in the
other.  She's wheezing like mad.

                    SLOAN
               Get up and put that tape in.

                                                   133.


She points the gun at his head.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Do what I say.

Delacroix takes the cassette tape off his desk and puts it
in the 3/4 inch desk.

                    SLOAN (CONT'D)
               Don't make me have to use this.

                    DELACROIX
               I didn't think this was in your
               studies at NYU.

Delacroix hits the PLAY button.

ON SCREEN

IMAGES.  HISTORY.  VISUALS.  Sloan has put together a tape
of the worst, most racist, stereotypical images from cinema
and TV over the last 100 years.  With these images there's
also a laugh-track.

                    SLOAN
               Watch this.  This is what you
               contributed to.  Because of you,
               Manray is dead.  Mu brother's dead.
               It's all because of you.

Delacroix can't watch the monitor.

                    DELACROIX
               I'm sorry.  I didn't know anyone
               would get hurt.  I'm sorry, please
               give me that gun before you hurt
               yourself.  Give me the gun.

He reaches for it.  BOOM!  Sloan screams.

                    SLOAN
               I told you but you wouldn't listen.
               You never listened to me.

                    DELACROIX
               Give me the gun.

She reluctantly hands it to him.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               Go, get out of here.  Go home.

Sloan runs out.  Delacroix slumps to the floor, WIPES HER
FINGERPRINTS off the revolver.

                                                   134.


ON DELACROIX

He looks at the monitor, the tape still playing.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               As I bled to death, as my very
               precious life oozed out of me all I
               could think of was that I never
               made my father proud.  My mother
               didn't count.

ON SCREEN

We see STEP 'N FETCHIT, MANTAN MORELAND and WILLIE BEST.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Everything I did, no matter how
               great or small, was always
               extraordinary to her.  With Daddy
               it was a different ball game.  He
               never saw me.  Pierre Delacroix.

ON DELACROIX

A pool of blood has formed around his dying body.

                    DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Now it was time to buy the farm,
               for me to meet my maker.  Goodbye
               cousins, and please tune in next
               week for the Best of Mantan - The
               New Millennium Minstrel Show.

ON SCREEN

We see MANTAN in BLACKFACE doing his BUCKDANCE

CLOSE ON DELACROIX

He looks at Mantan.

                    DELACROIX (CONT'D)
               For the love of Joseph and Mary,
               what have I done?  My God, what
               have I done?!

Delacroix slumps over dead.

                                          CUT TO:

                                                   135.


ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE OF MALCOLM X

               You've been had.  You've been took.
               You've been led astray.  Run amok.
               You've been bamboozled.

                                          FADE TO BLACK.
